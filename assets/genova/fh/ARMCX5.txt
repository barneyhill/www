# ARMCX5

## Overview
ARMCX5 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing X-linked 5. This protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a domain of unknown function (DUF634) at its C-terminus. ARMCX5 is part of the ARMCX gene cluster, which is specific to Eutherian mammals and plays a role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in neurons. The protein is predicted to be soluble and is involved in mitochondrial trafficking through interactions with proteins such as Kinesin, Miro, and Trak2. The gene is highly conserved among primates, indicating its evolutionary importance. Mutations or deletions in ARMCX5 have been linked to developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (KUSAMA2010Expression; LópezDoménech2012The; Tewari2010Armadillorepeat; Huang2021ARMC).

## Structure
ARMCX5 is a protein characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which are composed of a repeating 42 amino acid motif consisting of three alpha-helices. These motifs contribute to the formation of a superhelix structure, providing a versatile platform for protein-protein interactions (Tewari2010Armadillorepeat). The protein contains a domain of unknown function (DUF634) at its C-terminus, which is a characteristic feature shared among several ARMCX proteins, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved functional importance (KUSAMA2010Expression).

ARMCX5 is predicted to be a soluble protein, as it does not have a predicted transmembrane helix or a signal peptide, unlike some other ARMCX proteins (KUSAMA2010Expression). The protein is part of the ARMCX gene cluster, which is specific to Eutherian mammals and is involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics in neurons (LópezDoménech2012The). The armadillo repeats in ARMCX5 are involved in protein-protein interactions, which may include interactions with proteins like Kinesin, Miro, and Trak2, playing a role in mitochondrial trafficking (LópezDoménech2012The). The protein's structure and function are conserved in primates, with a high degree of sequence identity observed between humans and gorillas (Huang2021ARMC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deletions in the ARMCX5 gene have been associated with significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to developmental and neurological disorders. Partial deletion of the ARMCX5 gene may lead to Xq22.1 deletion syndrome, which can cause a range of clinical issues including epilepsy, cleft palate, intellectual disability, respiratory failure, and developmental defects in female heterozygotes (Huang2021ARMC). In a study involving a male patient with a novel 1.1 Mb deletion at Xq22.1, which included the ARMCX5 gene, severe phenotypes such as intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, and respiratory issues were observed. This deletion was confirmed through chromosomal microarray analysis and fluorescence in-situ hybridization, suggesting that the loss of ARMCX5, among other genes, is likely responsible for these phenotypes (Cao2016A). These findings indicate that ARMCX5 plays a crucial role in normal development and that its disruption can lead to significant congenital abnormalities and respiratory issues. The gene's high conservation in primates further underscores its potential importance in human health, as even small alterations can lead to severe clinical outcomes (Huang2021ARMC).
