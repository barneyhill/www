# TBC1D2B

## Overview
TBC1D2B is a gene that encodes the TBC1 domain family member 2B protein, which is a member of the Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC)-domain containing RAB-specific GTPase activating proteins (TBC/RABGAPs). This protein plays a critical role in intracellular membrane trafficking by regulating RAB GTPases, particularly through its interaction with RAB22 and RAB5. The TBC1D2B protein is characterized by several domains, including a TBC domain associated with GTPase-activating protein activity, a pleckstrin homology domain, and coiled-coil domains, which contribute to its function in endosomal trafficking and autophagy (Harms2024Loss; Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD). Clinically, mutations in the TBC1D2B gene are linked to a progressive neurological disorder with symptoms such as cognitive impairment and seizures, as well as potential implications in cancer metastasis, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (Harms2024Loss; Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD).

## Structure
The TBC1D2B protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains two coiled-coil (CC) domains, an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain (Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD). The TBC domain is associated with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, specifically for Rab GTPases, which are crucial for intracellular trafficking processes (Harms2024Loss). The protein also includes a RABGTPase-activating protein domain, which is essential for its function (Harms2024Loss).

The molecular structure of TBC1D2B is further defined by a LC3-interacting region, which suggests a role in autophagy, as it can bind to mammalian ATG8 proteins (Popovic2012Rab). The presence of these domains indicates that TBC1D2B may serve as a hub for recruiting other Rab22 GAPs, rather than having significant GAP activity itself (Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD).

The protein's structure may also include post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of TBC1D2B may exist, leading to different isoforms with varied functions, but specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The TBC1D2B gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC)-domain containing RAB-specific GTPase activating proteins (TBC/RABGAPs). These proteins are key regulators of RAB GTPases, which are involved in intracellular membrane trafficking processes. TBC1D2B specifically interacts with various RAB proteins, including RAB31, and facilitates the conversion of active RAB proteins into their inactive forms through its GTPase activating domain (Harms2024Loss).

In healthy human cells, TBC1D2B is involved in endosomal trafficking, particularly in the recruitment to RAB5-positive vesicles. It plays a crucial role in the internalization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in HeLa cells, functioning at RAB5-positive endocytic vesicles before they fuse with early endosomes or the EEA1-positive compartment (Harms2020Biallelic). TBC1D2B also co-localizes with vesicles positive for RAB5 and partially with EEA1, markers of early endosomes, suggesting its involvement in vesicle trafficking and potentially in the regulation of autophagy (Harms2024Loss).

The protein's activity is essential for cell survival, as TBC1D2B deficiency leads to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis under serum starvation conditions, indicating its protective role against apoptosis and support for cell survival under stress (Harms2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D2B gene are associated with a progressive neurological disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, seizures, gingival overgrowth, and mandibular abnormalities. This disorder typically manifests with developmental delay, cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy, and progressive neurological deterioration beginning between ages 10 and 20, sometimes leading to severe mental deterioration and early adulthood mortality (Harms2024Loss). The disorder is linked to biallelic loss-of-function variants in TBC1D2B, which result in significantly impaired protein function or complete loss of function (Harms2020Biallelic; Harms2024Loss).

The clinical presentation of TBC1D2B-related disorders can vary, with some individuals experiencing severe symptoms and others having milder forms. Novel hematological abnormalities have also been noted in association with TBC1D2B deficiency (Harms2024Loss). The gene's role in endosomal trafficking and cell survival suggests that disruptions in these processes may underlie the observed clinical manifestations (Harms2020Biallelic).

In the context of cancer, TBC1D2B has been implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. It acts as a metastasis suppressor by regulating the endocytosis and degradation of E-cadherin, a protein involved in cell adhesion. Alterations in TBC1D2B expression or function could impact cancer progression and metastasis (Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD).

## Interactions
TBC1D2B is known to interact with several proteins, particularly within the context of intracellular trafficking and cancer metastasis. It acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Rab22, a small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking of clathrin-independent endosomes. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell migration and invasion in lung cancer. Overexpression of TBC1D2B has been shown to reduce cell migration and invasion, while its knockdown increases these activities, highlighting its role in modulating Rab22 activity (Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD).

TBC1D2B also physically associates with Rab22, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, but does not interact with Rab31 (Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD). This interaction is significant in the context of E-cadherin internalization, where TBC1D2B overexpression leads to increased E-cadherin levels, suggesting a role in stabilizing cell-cell adhesion and suppressing metastasis (Manshouri2019ZEB1NuRD).

Additionally, TBC1D2B is recruited to RAB5-positive endocytic vesicles, indicating its involvement in early endosomal trafficking. Its absence results in decreased epidermal growth factor (EGF) internalization, further supporting its role in endocytic processes (Harms2020Biallelic). These interactions underscore TBC1D2B's importance in cellular trafficking and its potential impact on cancer progression and neurodevelopmental disorders.
