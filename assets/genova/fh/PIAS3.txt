# PIAS3

## Overview
PIAS3 is a gene that encodes the protein inhibitor of activated STAT 3, a member of the PIAS (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT) family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in various cellular processes, including modulation of transcriptional activity and inhibition of DNA-binding activity of STAT3, a critical transcription factor in cytokine signaling pathways. PIAS3 is characterized by several conserved domains, such as the SAP domain, PINIT domain, and a RING-finger-like domain, which contribute to its role as an E3 ligase in SUMOylation, a post-translational modification process. The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with multiple proteins, including STAT3, Smad3, and ATF1, influencing cell growth, immune response, and other cellular functions. Alterations in PIAS3 expression or function have been implicated in various diseases, notably cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Chung1997Specific; Long2003Activation; Li2021PIAS3).

## Structure
PIAS3 is a member of the PIAS protein family, characterized by several conserved domains essential for its function. The protein includes an N-terminal SAP domain, which is involved in DNA binding and protein interactions (Duval2003The). The PINIT domain is crucial for nuclear retention and interaction with STAT3, with specific mutations in this domain affecting its binding ability (Mautsa2011The; Duval2003The). The PINIT domain has been modeled using the crystallographic structure of Siz1, revealing it as a monomeric species with a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa (Mautsa2011The).

PIAS3 also contains a RING-finger-like domain, which is required for its E3 ligase activity in SUMOylation, a post-translational modification that modulates the activity of various transcription factors (Nakagawa2016PIAS3). The C-terminal acidic domain of PIAS3 is involved in binding to STAT3 and contains a highly conserved SUMO-1 binding motif (Mautsa2011The). PIAS3 can undergo post-translational modifications such as sumoylation, which influences its function and interactions with other proteins (Man2006PIAS3). The protein has splice variant isoforms, including PIAS3L, which features an additional sequence due to a retained intron (Duval2003The).

## Function
PIAS3 (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 3) plays a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity in healthy human cells. It is involved in the activation of Smad-dependent transcription, particularly in the context of TGF-β signaling. PIAS3 forms a ternary complex with Smad3 and the coactivator p300/CBP, enhancing Smad transcriptional activity. This interaction is facilitated by the RING domain of PIAS3, which is crucial for its binding to p300/CBP and subsequent transcriptional activation (Long2003Activation).

PIAS3 also interacts with the transcription factor ATF1, modulating the expression of the human ferritin H gene through an antioxidant-responsive element (ARE). It reverses the repressive effect of ATF1 on the ferritin H ARE, suggesting a role as an activator in this context. This function does not rely on the sumoylation of ATF1, indicating that PIAS3's interaction with ATF1 is crucial for its regulatory role (Iwasaki2007PIAS3).

In addition to its role in transcriptional activation, PIAS3 can inhibit the DNA-binding activity of STAT3, thereby regulating gene expression in response to cytokine signaling (Chung1997Specific). PIAS3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell growth and immune response.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PIAS3 expression or function are implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), PIAS3 mRNA expression is significantly reduced in cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients, suggesting a role in the disease's pathology. The PIAS3/STAT3/Nestin/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which is involved in cell survival and oxidative stress response, may offer insights into therapeutic targets for AD (Li2021PIAS3).

In cancer, PIAS3 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting STAT3, a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation and survival. Low PIAS3 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes in squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC), where it correlates with a higher risk of death (Abbas2015PIAS3). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PIAS3 protein is significantly diminished, leading to increased STAT3 activity and enhanced tumor cell proliferation (Brantley2008Loss). PIAS3 downregulation is also observed in other cancers, such as gastric, breast, and lung cancers, contributing to tumorigenesis through the JAK/STAT signaling cascade (Li2024PIAS).

In malignant mesothelioma, PIAS3 expression is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-18a, which may contribute to cancer progression by suppressing PIAS3 expression (He2018Post‐transcriptional). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PIAS3 in various diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PIAS3 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It specifically binds to STAT3, inhibiting its DNA-binding activity and transcriptional function. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, demonstrating that PIAS3 can inhibit STAT3's DNA-binding activity without affecting other transcription factors like NF-κB (Chung1997Specific). The interaction with STAT3 involves multiple domains of PIAS3, including the PINIT domain, which is crucial for binding and nuclear localization (Mautsa2011The).

PIAS3 also interacts with Smad proteins, particularly Smad3, enhancing Smad transcriptional activity. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domain of Smad3 and the RING domain of PIAS3. PIAS3 can form a ternary complex with Smad3 and the coactivator p300, which is enhanced by TGF-β treatment, indicating its role in activating Smad-dependent transcription (Long2003Activation).

Additionally, PIAS3 binds to the microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), inhibiting its transcriptional activity. The PIAS3 82-132 domain is responsible for this interaction, which is independent of sumoylation and involves specific residues like Y94 (Levy2006Identifying).
