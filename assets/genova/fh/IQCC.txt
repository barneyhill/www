# IQCC

## Overview
The IQCC gene encodes the IQ motif containing C protein, which is characterized by the presence of an IQ motif—a sequence known for mediating interactions with calmodulin and other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. This protein is conserved across various mammalian species, suggesting its evolutionary importance. Although the precise biological functions of the IQCC protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been identified as a potential biomarker for early-grade breast cancer due to its up-regulation in affected individuals. The protein may also play a role in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, potentially influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis (Pendharkar2018A). Additionally, genetic studies have linked the IQCC gene to various health-related conditions, including its potential involvement in suicidal ideation among individuals with severe mental illnesses and its association with variations in human height (SchmidtKastner2019S94.; Rotwein2020Revisiting). Despite these associations, further research is necessary to clarify the specific molecular interactions and clinical implications of the IQCC gene and its encoded protein.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The IQCC gene has been implicated in several health-related conditions through genetic studies. A study on veterans with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder identified IQCC as one of the genes potentially linked to suicidal ideation and behavior. This association was found in a gene-level analysis using the UTMOST approach, which highlighted significant correlations in the European American group. The study suggests that there may be common genomic risk factors for suicidal tendencies across severe mental illnesses and the general population (SchmidtKastner2019S94.).

In the context of human height, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IQCC gene, rs150341307, has been associated with a decrease in adult height by 0.8 cm. This variant is categorized under uncommon coding and noncoding gene variants that influence height, with a minor allele frequency of 0.30% (Rotwein2020Revisiting). However, the clinical significance of IQCC gene mutations beyond their impact on height is not well-documented, and no direct associations with specific diseases or conditions have been established in the provided context (Rotwein2020Revisiting).

## Interactions
The IQCC protein, encoded by the IQ motif containing C gene, has been identified as a potential biomarker for early-grade breast cancer due to its up-regulation in serum samples from affected patients. Despite its potential significance, the specific molecular interactions of IQCC remain largely unexplored. The protein is conserved across many mammals and contains an IQ motif, which is typically involved in interactions with calmodulin or other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. However, there are no detailed reports on the physical interactions of IQCC with other proteins or nucleic acids (Pendharkar2018A).

The study by Pendharkar et al. suggests that IQCC may interact with DAPLE through Dvl, potentially playing a role in the activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. This interaction hints at a possible involvement in processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis, although the exact nature of these interactions is not explicitly described (Pendharkar2018A). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions involving IQCC, which could provide deeper insights into its role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
