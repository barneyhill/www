# C1QC

## Overview
The C1QC gene encodes the C chain of the complement component C1q, a pivotal protein in the classical complement pathway, which is integral to the immune system's ability to recognize and clear pathogens and apoptotic cells. The C1q protein is a complex molecule composed of 18 polypeptide chains, including six C chains, and is characterized by a modular structure that facilitates diverse biological functions (Gaboriaud2003The; Kishore2003Modular). The C1q C chain, along with the A and B chains, forms a heterotrimeric assembly that is essential for the protein's role in immune regulation and homeostasis (Gaboriaud2003The). C1q is synthesized by various cell types, including monocytes and macrophages, and is involved in modulating immune responses, influencing processes such as osteoclast development and synapse pruning (Teo2012Complement; Ghebrehiwet2017C1q). Alterations in C1QC expression or function are linked to several clinical conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Yao2023C1QC; Lubbers2019Complex).

## Structure
The C1QC gene encodes the C chain of the complement protein C1q, which is a crucial component of the classical complement pathway. The C1q protein is composed of 18 polypeptide chains, including six A, six B, and six C chains, each with a short N-terminal region, a collagen-like region, and a C-terminal globular domain (gC1q) (Bally2013Expression; Kishore2003Modular). The gC1q domain is modular and forms a heterotrimeric assembly with the A and B chains, contributing to the protein's versatile recognition properties (Gaboriaud2003The; Kishore2003Modular).

The globular head of C1q, which includes the C chain, is characterized by a jellyroll topology consisting of a 10-stranded β-sandwich (Roumenina2006Interaction). This structure is stabilized by non-polar interactions and a calcium ion, which may play a role in the stability and function of the heterotrimeric assembly (Gaboriaud2003The). The C1q protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is evident at Asn 124 of the C1qA chain, contributing to its stability and function (Moreau2016Structural). The modular organization of the gC1q domain allows for independent functioning of each chain, providing functional flexibility and versatility (Kishore2003Modular).

## Function
The C1QC gene encodes the C chain of the complement component C1q, which is a crucial part of the classical complement pathway. C1q is involved in various immune processes, including the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells and pathogens. It is synthesized by several cell types, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts, and can be found both in membrane-anchored and soluble forms (Teo2012Complement; Ghebrehiwet2017C1q).

In healthy human cells, C1q plays a significant role in immune regulation by modulating the activity of macrophages and dendritic cells. When bound to apoptotic cells, C1q suppresses the proliferation of inflammatory T cell subsets, such as Th17 and Th1, while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-27 and IL-10. This activity helps maintain immune homeostasis and prevents excessive inflammatory responses (Clarke2014Complement).

C1q also influences osteoclast development, enhancing their differentiation from monocytes and upregulating the expression of osteoclast signature molecules and cytokines, which suggests a role in bone metabolism (Teo2012Complement). Through these functions, C1q contributes to both immune surveillance and bone health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the C1QC gene are associated with several clinical conditions. C1QC is a component of the complement system, and its deficiency can lead to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune disorders. A case study of a Dutch woman with compound heterozygous mutations in the C1QC gene, specifically c.100G > A p.(Gly34Arg) and c.205C > T p.(Arg69X), resulted in a complete absence of C1q in her serum. This deficiency was linked to recurrent infections, neurological complications, and SLE, characterized by symptoms such as butterfly rash and thrombocytopenia (Lubbers2019Complex).

Hereditary C1q deficiency, caused by mutations in C1QC and related genes, is a rare monogenic disorder that leads to defective complement pathway activation. It is associated with SLE-like manifestations, increased susceptibility to infections, and central nervous system inflammation. The condition is characterized by elevated levels of interferon alpha in cerebrospinal fluid and activation of the type 1 interferon pathway (Triaille2024Hereditary).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), high expression of C1QC is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. C1QC expression is notably upregulated in KIRC tissues, correlating with advanced disease stages and immune-related signaling pathways (Yao2023C1QC).

## Interactions
C1QC, a component of the C1q protein, plays a significant role in the classical complement pathway by forming a complex with C1qA and C1qB chains. This complex is crucial for the recognition and binding of various ligands, including antibodies, apoptotic cells, and pathogens, facilitating interactions with C1r and C1s proteases to activate the complement cascade (Bally2021Functional; Thielens2017C1q:).

C1QC is involved in immune-related signaling pathways and interacts with proteins such as CSF1R, VSIG4, and C3AR1, which are implicated in immune cell activation and regulation (Yao2023C1QC). These interactions suggest a role for C1QC in modulating immune responses and influencing tumor microenvironments, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Yao2023C1QC).

In colon carcinoma, C1QC is associated with pathways like macrophage and granulocyte differentiation and classical complement activation. It is also linked to synapse pruning, indicating its involvement in diverse biological processes beyond immune regulation (Deng2022Complement). These interactions highlight C1QC's multifaceted role in both immune function and disease progression.
