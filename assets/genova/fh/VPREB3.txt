# VPREB3

## Overview
VPREB3 is a gene that encodes the protein V-set pre-B cell surrogate light chain 3, which is integral to the early development of B cells. This protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum of pre-B lymphocytes, where it plays a crucial role in the assembly and transport of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex. As a component of the immunoglobulin superfamily, V-set pre-B cell surrogate light chain 3 is involved in the proper assembly of immunoglobulin heavy chains with surrogate light chains, facilitating B cell maturation and differentiation (Rosnet2004Binding; Mårtensson2007The). The protein's interactions extend beyond immunological functions, as it is also implicated in steroidogenic pathways in the adrenal cortex (Felizola2015PreB). VPREB3's expression and function are significant in various clinical contexts, including its role in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis (Nourbakhsh2024Datadriven; Li2024Identification).

## Function
The VPREB3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the early stages of B cell development. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of pre-B lymphocytes, where it is involved in the assembly and transport of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex. This complex is crucial for B cell maturation and differentiation, as it facilitates the proper assembly of immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgHC) with surrogate light chains (SLC) (Rosnet2004Binding; Mårtensson2007The).

VPREB3 is suggested to assist in the ER exit of membrane-bound heavy chains (mHC), potentially forming a complex with other molecules to aid in this process (Mårtensson2007The). In humans, VPREB3 is expressed in immature and mature B cells, indicating its involvement in BCR and pre-BCR biosynthesis (Rosnet2004Binding). The protein is also implicated in regulating the maturation and secretion of immunoglobulin light chains (IgLC) by retaining them in the ER, thus preventing their premature secretion and ensuring proper immune function (Rosnet2004Binding).

Overall, VPREB3 is essential for the proper development and function of the immune system by ensuring the correct assembly and maturation of immunoglobulin components in B cells.

## Clinical Significance
VPREB3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly B-cell ALL (B-ALL), VPREB3 is significantly upregulated compared to T-cell ALL (T-ALL). This upregulation is associated with activation of the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway, contributing to a worse prognosis in B-ALL patients. High expression of VPREB3 correlates with a higher risk of death, as indicated by a hazard ratio above 1, and is linked to lower survival probabilities (Nourbakhsh2024Datadriven).

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), VPREB3 is identified as a hub gene with significant down-expression in MDS CD34+ cells compared to healthy cells. This down-regulation is negatively correlated with survival, suggesting that low VPREB3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in MDS patients (Li2024Identification).

VPREB3 also plays a role in mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Its expression, often in conjunction with ID3, is highly specific for diagnosing BL and is associated with c-MYC translocations, which are crucial for distinguishing between BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Rodig2010The; Soldini2013The).

## Interactions
The VPREB3 protein is involved in several interactions, primarily within the context of B cell development and function. In chicken B cells, VPREB3 is known to bind preferentially to free immunoglobulin light chains (IgLC), forming covalent heterodimers that involve interchain disulfide bonds. This interaction occurs predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where VPREB3 retains free IgLC, preventing their maturation and secretion (Rosnet2004Binding). VPREB3 also weakly associates with immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgHC) in the absence of competing IgLC, indicating a selective binding preference (Rosnet2004Binding).

In humans, VPREB3 expression has been observed in the adrenal cortex, where it may interact with proteins involved in aldosterone biosynthesis. It shows significant correlations with aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2), suggesting a role in steroidogenic pathways (Felizola2015PreB). These interactions highlight VPREB3's potential involvement in both immunological and non-immunological processes, indicating its diverse functional roles across different tissues.
