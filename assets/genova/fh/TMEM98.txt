# TMEM98

## Overview
TMEM98 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 98, a single-pass type II transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The TMEM98 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain and a Grap2 and cyclin-D-interacting (GCIP) domain, which contribute to its structural and functional roles within the cell (Cross2019Missense). Functionally, TMEM98 is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by modulating the activity of FRAT proteins, which are crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation (van2020TMEM98). Additionally, TMEM98 plays a significant role in eye development, particularly in the regulation of eye size through its interaction with the MYRF protein, a transcription factor essential for ocular development (Cross2020The). Mutations in the TMEM98 gene have been associated with ocular conditions such as autosomal dominant nanophthalmos, highlighting its clinical significance in eye health (Koenighofer2021A; Prasov2020Novel).

## Structure
The TMEM98 protein is a single-pass type II transmembrane protein consisting of 226 amino acids (Cross2019Missense). It has a transmembrane domain near the N-terminus, spanning amino acids 4 to 24 (Cross2019Missense). The protein is predicted to have a five-helix bundle structure following the N-terminal transmembrane domain, with structural homology to cyclin-D1-binding protein 1 (CCNDBP1) (Cross2019Missense). TMEM98 contains a Grap2 and cyclin-D-interacting (GCIP) domain spanning amino acids 49 to 152 (Cross2019Missense).

The tertiary structure of TMEM98 includes a hydrophobic core where the I135 residue is located, interacting with amino acids from four of the alpha-helices (Cross2019Missense). The protein's C-terminal part is extracellular, confirmed through experiments with epitope-tagged versions of TMEM98 (Cross2020The). TMEM98 also interacts with the MYRF protein, inhibiting its self-cleavage, which is crucial for eye size regulation (Cross2020The).

TMEM98 has two predicted splicing forms, TMEM98-v1 and TMEM98-v2, which differ slightly in the 5ʹ-untranslated region but are almost identical in protein sequence (Li2021TMEM98).

## Function
TMEM98 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway. It acts as a negative regulator by interacting with FRAT proteins, specifically FRAT1 and FRAT2, to reduce their protein levels and signaling activity. This modulation of FRAT proteins influences the ß-catenin/TCF signaling, which is crucial for maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during tissue morphogenesis and maintenance (van2020TMEM98).

TMEM98 is also involved in eye development and size specification. It interacts with the MYRF protein, inhibiting its self-cleavage, which is essential for MYRF's function as a transcription factor. This interaction is critical for regulating eye size, as demonstrated in mouse models where loss of TMEM98 leads to enlarged eyes (Cross2020The).

In addition to its role in signaling pathways, TMEM98 is implicated in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. It influences the AKT/GSK3β/cyclin D1 signaling pathway and β-catenin expression, which are involved in these cellular activities (Li2021TMEM98).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM98 gene are associated with several ocular conditions, most notably autosomal dominant nanophthalmos. This rare disorder is characterized by a reduced axial length of the eye, leading to high hyperopia and an increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Specific mutations, such as p.Arg201Pro, p.Ala193Pro, and p.His196Pro, have been identified as causative for nanophthalmos-4, a subtype of this condition. These mutations are located in the charge-polarized helix α8 of the TMEM98 protein, affecting its stability and function (Koenighofer2021A; Prasov2020Novel).

In addition to nanophthalmos, TMEM98 mutations have been linked to other retinal defects. In mouse models, missense mutations like A193P and H196P result in retinal defects such as white spots and retinal folds, although these do not lead to nanophthalmos in mice (Hassall2023Phenotypic; Cross2019Missense). TMEM98 is also implicated in the regulation of eye size, interacting with the MYRF protein to inhibit its self-cleavage. Disruption of this interaction can lead to abnormal eye development, as seen in both enlarged and small eye phenotypes (van2020TMEM98; Cross2020The).

## Interactions
TMEM98 is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with the NF90 protein, which enhances the stability of TMEM98 mRNA, increasing its half-life from approximately 14 to 30 hours. This interaction is facilitated by an 8-nucleotide motif in the last exon of TMEM98 mRNA, and mutation of this motif disrupts the binding capacity to NF90 (Ao2020TMEM98).

TMEM98 also interacts with the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), a transcription factor. TMEM98 inhibits MYRF's self-cleavage, preventing its abnormal activation and nuclear localization. This interaction is crucial for eye size specification, as demonstrated in studies involving retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of mice (Cross2020The).

Additionally, TMEM98 is identified as a binding partner of FRAT2, a component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. TMEM98 acts as a negative regulator by reducing FRAT2 protein levels and signaling activity. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism that fine-tunes CTNNB1/TCF signaling activity (van2020TMEM98). TMEM98's interaction with FRAT2 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting its role in modulating FRAT-mediated signaling (van2019TMEM98).
