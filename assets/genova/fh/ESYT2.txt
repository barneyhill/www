# ESYT2

## Overview
The ESYT2 gene encodes the protein extended synaptotagmin 2, which is a member of the extended synaptotagmin family involved in cellular processes at membrane contact sites. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane region, which anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and its synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain, which facilitates lipid transfer between membranes (Reinisch2016SMPdomain; FernándezBusnadiego2015Threedimensional). Additionally, ESYT2 contains multiple C2 domains that interact with the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner, playing a crucial role in tethering the ER to the plasma membrane and regulating lipid transport (Pan2023The). The protein is involved in calcium dynamics, lipid homeostasis, and actin dynamics, and it interacts with various proteins, including STIM1 and Sec22b, to mediate its functions (Gallo2020Role; Woo2020The). Alterations in the ESYT2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, cancer, and metabolic diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways.

## Structure
Extended synaptotagmin 2 (ESYT2) is a protein characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains an N-terminal transmembrane region that anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, followed by a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain. This SMP domain is part of the Tubular Lipid Binding (TULIP) superfamily and forms a dimer with a hydrophobic cavity capable of binding glycerophospholipids, facilitating lipid transfer between membranes (Reinisch2016SMPdomain; FernándezBusnadiego2015Threedimensional).

ESYT2 also includes multiple C2 domains, which are calcium-binding motifs involved in membrane interactions. These domains, particularly the C-terminal ones, interact with the plasma membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], and their activity is regulated by calcium levels (Reinisch2016SMPdomain; Pan2023The). The C2 domains contribute to the protein's role in tethering the ER to the plasma membrane and facilitating lipid transport at membrane contact sites.

ESYT2 exists in different isoforms, including a short isoform, E-Syt2S, which is predominant in T cells and plays a specific role in calcium dynamics by interacting with STIM1 (Woo2020The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
Extended synaptotagmin 2 (ESYT2) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. It plays a significant role in calcium dynamics and lipid transfer, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In T cells, the short isoform of ESYT2 (E-Syt2S) interacts with STIM1, facilitating its recruitment to ER-PM junctions and enhancing its interaction with ORAI1, which is crucial for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). This process is vital for the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway and cytokine production, such as IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF (Woo2020The).

ESYT2 also contributes to lipid homeostasis by facilitating the passive transport of glycerolipids between bilayers, a process influenced by calcium levels. Although not essential for cellular life, ESYT2 helps in adaptive changes at the plasma membrane following acute perturbations, such as the disappearance of diacylglycerol (DAG) upon phospholipase C activation (Saheki2016Control).

Additionally, ESYT2 is involved in actin dynamics and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling by recruiting the p21-activated kinase PAK1, which affects actin polymerization and endocytosis (Jean2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ESYT2 gene can significantly impact cellular processes, potentially contributing to various diseases. ESYT2 is involved in membrane contact sites and lipid transfer, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in these processes due to ESYT2 mutations or expression changes may lead to neurological disorders, as the gene plays a role in synaptic function and neuronal communication. Alterations in ESYT2 have also been implicated in cancer, where its role in lipid transfer and membrane dynamics could affect cell proliferation and survival. Additionally, metabolic diseases may arise from ESYT2 dysfunction, given its involvement in lipid metabolism and energy balance. The gene's significance in disease pathology underscores the importance of understanding its interactions and regulatory mechanisms to develop potential therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
Extended synaptotagmin 2 (ESYT2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function at membrane contact sites. ESYT2 interacts with the R-SNARE protein Sec22b, a key interaction necessary for neuronal growth and differentiation. This interaction occurs at ER-PM contact sites and involves the Longin domain of Sec22b. The formation of a ternary complex with Sec22b and Syntaxin 1 (Stx1) is essential for the enhanced neuronal growth phenotype induced by ESYT2 (Gallo2020Role).

In T cells, the short isoform of ESYT2 (E-Syt2S) interacts directly with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), facilitating its recruitment to ER-PM junctions. This interaction is critical for the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a process important for calcium dynamics in T cells. E-Syt2S enhances the association of STIM1 with ORAI1, another protein involved in calcium signaling, thereby playing a significant role in calcium homeostasis (Woo2020The).

ESYT2 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to regulate the localization and aggregation of STIM1, affecting the activation of the SOCE pathway. These interactions highlight the role of ESYT2 in calcium signaling and lipid transfer at membrane contact sites (Pan2023The).
