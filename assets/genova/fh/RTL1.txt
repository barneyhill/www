# RTL1

## Overview
The RTL1 gene, also known as retrotransposon Gag like 1, is a paternally expressed imprinted gene that encodes a protein with structural features reminiscent of retroviral proteins. This gene is crucial for various biological processes, including fetal and neonatal muscle development, placental function, and brain development. The RTL1 protein, characterized by its retrotransposon-derived domains, plays a significant role in stabilizing muscle fibers and maintaining the placental vascular network. Its expression is intricately regulated by microRNAs derived from the RTL1 antisense transcript, ensuring proper developmental outcomes. Dysregulation of RTL1 is implicated in genomic imprinting disorders such as Kagami-Ogata Syndrome and Temple Syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in growth and developmental anomalies (Kitazawa2020Deficiency; Mainieri2019Retrotransposon; KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived).

## Structure
The RTL1 protein, encoded by the RTL1 gene, is derived from a retrotransposon and retains several structural features typical of retroviral proteins. It includes conserved capsid and protease domains, which are characteristic of its retroviral origin (Mainieri2019Retrotransposon; Dini2021Paternally). The protein is encoded by a single exon and has lost critical residues in the polymerase, RNaseH, and integrase domains, indicating a loss of some retrotransposon activities (Mainieri2019Retrotransposon). Despite these losses, the RTL1 protein maintains a conserved open reading frame, suggesting an evolutionary pressure to preserve functional protein domains (Byrne2010The).

The RTL1 protein is expressed as a full-length protein in skeletal muscle, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 199 kDa, as observed in mouse models (Kitazawa2020Deficiency). The protein's structure includes six domains typical of a retrotransposon: a capsid-like or retrotransposon gag protein domain, a retroviral aspartyl protease domain, a reverse transcriptase domain, and an RNaseH domain (Byrne2010The). The presence of antisense miRNA affects the integrase core domain, and mutations in catalytic sites likely inactivate certain activities (Byrne2010The). The protein's GAG-like domains enable the formation of virus-like particles, which have been utilized in RNA delivery systems (Shiura2023Roles).

## Function
The RTL1 gene, also known as PEG11, is a paternally expressed imprinted gene that plays a crucial role in fetal and neonatal muscle development. It is involved in stabilizing the muscle contractile apparatus and regulating muscle constriction by interacting with desmin, a component of the sarcomeric cytoskeleton. RTL1 is localized in muscle fibers and the sarcolemma, and it partially merges with desmin, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers (Kitazawa2020Deficiency).

In addition to its role in muscle development, RTL1 is essential for placental function. It maintains the fetal capillary network in the placenta, which is vital for proper nutrient transfer and fetal growth during gestation (Kitazawa2020Deficiency; Mainieri2019Retrotransposon). The gene's expression is regulated by microRNAs processed from the maternally expressed RTL1 antisense transcript, which helps control the levels of RTL1 protein (Mainieri2019Retrotransposon).

RTL1 is also expressed in specific brain structures, such as the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum, indicating its involvement in brain development and function, particularly in eutherian-specific structures (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RTL1 gene are associated with several genomic imprinting disorders, notably Kagami-Ogata Syndrome (KOS14) and Temple Syndrome (TS14). These conditions arise from aberrant regulation of the imprinted region on chromosome 14, involving paternal and maternal duplications, deletions, and changes in DNA methylation (Kitazawa2021The). In KOS14, excessive RTL1 expression, often due to paternal uniparental disomy, leads to symptoms such as neonatal lethality, respiratory failure, and developmental delay. This overexpression is linked to the loss of RTL1as-encoded microRNAs, which normally repress RTL1 expression (Ogata2015Kagami–Ogata; Kagami2015Comprehensive).

In TS14, RTL1 deficiency results in growth retardation, muscle hypotonia, and feeding difficulties (Kitazawa2020Deficiency). Mouse models have shown that both deficiency and overexpression of RTL1 lead to distinct muscle abnormalities, reflecting the muscle-related symptoms observed in these syndromes (Kitazawa2020Deficiency). The gene's role in neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric functions is also implicated in the neurological defects seen in KOS14 and TS14, with irregular RTL1 expression contributing to symptoms like developmental delay and intellectual disability (Kitazawa2021The).

## Interactions
The RTL1 gene, also known as retrotransposon Gag like 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in muscle and placental development. RTL1 interacts with DESMIN, a component of the sarcomere cytoskeleton, suggesting a role in stabilizing the muscle contractile apparatus and regulating muscle contraction. This interaction is significant for muscle development during fetal and neonatal stages (Kitazawa2020Deficiency; KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived).

In the context of placental development, RTL1 is expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for angiogenesis. It is involved in the formation of the placental vascular network, and its expression is regulated by the maternally expressed miR-127, which has an opposite expression pattern. This regulatory interaction is crucial for proper placental function and fetal growth (Dini2021Paternally).

RTL1 also participates in interactions involving self-targeting microRNAs, such as miR-432 and miR-434, which are derived from tandem repeats in the RTL1 gene. These microRNAs can target the paternally-expressed mRNA, reducing RTL1 protein production when maternally inherited (Mainieri2019Retrotransposon).
