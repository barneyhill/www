# DRAM1

## Overview
The DRAM1 gene encodes the protein DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 1, which is a pivotal component in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. As a lysosomal protein, DRAM1 is integral to the modulation of autophagic processes, particularly through its role in lysosomal acidification and protease activation, thereby enhancing autophagic flux (Guan2015DRAM1; Zhang2013DRAM1). It is a direct transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, linking it to cellular stress responses and apoptotic pathways (Crighton2006DRAM). DRAM1's interactions with proteins such as BAX and EPS15 underscore its involvement in both apoptosis and tumor suppression, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology (Guan2015DRAM1; Geng2020DRAM1).

## Function
The DRAM1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is a direct target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is involved in the modulation of autophagy by promoting lysosomal acidification and protease activation, which enhances autophagic flux (Guan2015DRAM1; Zhang2013DRAM1). DRAM1 inhibits the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) and the activation of the class I PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-rpS6 pathway, which are essential for autophagy and apoptosis (Lu2019DRAM1). This inhibition affects cell proliferation by reducing rpS6 phosphorylation, which is linked to protein synthesis and cell size regulation (Lu2019DRAM1).

DRAM1 is predominantly localized in lysosomes, where it is essential for the proper formation and clearance of autophagic vacuoles (Zhang2013DRAM1). It also regulates apoptosis by interacting with the proapoptotic protein BAX, preventing its autophagic degradation and increasing its protein levels, which links DRAM1 to apoptotic signaling (Guan2015DRAM1). Through these mechanisms, DRAM1 maintains cellular homeostasis and responds to stress conditions, playing a significant role in cell survival and death pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DRAM1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high DRAM1 expression is associated with the mesenchymal subclass, which is linked to increased aggressiveness and invasion. This high expression correlates with poor overall survival in GBM patients, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Galavotti2012The). In contrast, DRAM1 acts as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lower levels of DRAM1 in NSCLC are associated with poor clinical outcomes, and its overexpression inhibits tumor growth and invasion by promoting the lysosomal degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Geng2020DRAM1).

In oral tumors, DRAM expression is significantly downregulated compared to normal cells, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive function. This downregulation is linked to epigenetic silencing through methylation of its promoter region (Crighton2006DRAM). DRAM1 is also involved in autophagy and apoptosis, with its expression being crucial for p53-mediated apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor suppression (Crighton2006DRAM). These findings highlight the complex role of DRAM1 in cancer, where its function may vary depending on the tumor type or stage.

## Interactions
DRAM1 (DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in autophagy and apoptosis. DRAM1 interacts with EPS15, a protein essential for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis. This interaction facilitates the lysosomal degradation of EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, promoting tumor suppression by accelerating EGFR trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes (Geng2020DRAM1).

DRAM1 also interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein BAX, increasing its protein levels by inhibiting its autophagic degradation. This interaction stabilizes BAX, prolonging its half-life and promoting its lysosomal localization, which is crucial for the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Guan2015DRAM1).

In the context of autophagy, DRAM1 enhances the binding of ULK1 to Atg13, which is essential for autophagosome formation. It also inhibits the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, affecting the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and stress response (Lu2019DRAM1).

DRAM1's interactions extend to the lysosomal delivery of mycobacterium marinum in macrophages, where it mediates the interaction between the bacteria and the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1, highlighting its role in intracellular host defense (BanducciKarp2023DRAM1).
