# TAS2R43

## Overview
TAS2R43 is a gene that encodes the taste 2 receptor member 43, a protein belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the perception of bitter tastes, playing a crucial role in dietary choices and the avoidance of potentially harmful substances. The TAS2R43 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs, although it exhibits low sequence homology with other GPCR classes (Behrens2020StructureFunction). Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS2R43 is expressed in various tissues, including lung macrophages, where it may influence inflammatory responses, indicating a broader physiological role (GrassinDelyle2019Bitter). Variations in the TAS2R43 gene have been linked to differences in the perception of bitterness from compounds like caffeine and have been associated with health conditions such as Balkan Endemic Nephropathy and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in both sensory and clinical contexts (Pirastu2014Association; Wooding2012Association; Salvestrini2020Denatonium).

## Structure
The TAS2R43 protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by seven transmembrane domains, three intracellular loops, and three extracellular loops, with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus (Behrens2020StructureFunction). These structural features are typical of GPCRs, although TAS2Rs, including TAS2R43, have low sequence homology with other GPCR classes, complicating their classification (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

The primary structure of TAS2R43 consists of amino acid sequences that form the basis for its secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure includes alpha helices that span the cell membrane, forming the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these helices, creating a binding pocket for ligands. This binding pocket is located at the extracellular side of transmembrane domains III, V, VI, and VII (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for the proper folding and cell surface expression of TAS2R43. An N-linked oligosaccharide in the second extracellular loop is essential for receptor folding and routing to the plasma membrane (Behrens2020StructureFunction). The receptor can form oligomers, although its functional profile is primarily explained by homomeric forms (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

## Function
The TAS2R43 gene encodes a bitter taste receptor that is part of the TAS2R family, which are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in the perception of bitter tastes. These receptors are primarily located on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue, where they detect bitter compounds and trigger signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of bitterness. This sensory function influences dietary choices and helps in the avoidance of potentially toxic substances (Pirastu2014Association).

TAS2R43 is specifically sensitive to compounds such as caffeine, and its variants have been associated with differences in caffeine bitterness perception. The receptor's activity is linked to the perception of bitterness in coffee, with certain genetic variants correlating with a higher liking for coffee due to reduced bitterness perception (Pirastu2014Association).

In addition to its role in taste perception, TAS2R43 is expressed in other tissues, such as lung macrophages, where it may play a role in modulating inflammatory responses. The expression of TAS2R43 in these cells suggests a broader physiological role beyond taste, potentially involving the regulation of immune responses (GrassinDelyle2019Bitter).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAS2R43 gene have been associated with several health conditions. Notably, variations in TAS2R43 are linked to Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), a kidney disease prevalent in certain regions of Eastern Europe. The TAS2R43-W35/H212 variant, which is highly sensitive to aristolochic acid, a nephrotoxin found in contaminated wheat supplies, is paradoxically associated with increased susceptibility to BEN. This suggests that while the receptor's high sensitivity might drive aversion to the toxin, it could also affect absorption and activation of the toxin, potentially increasing vulnerability to the disease (Wooding2012Association).

In the context of cancer, TAS2R43 expression has been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The activation of TAS2R43 by bitter compounds like denatonium has been shown to influence gene expression profiles, affecting processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and motility. This suggests a potential role for TAS2R43 in the extrinsic regulation of leukemia cell functions, particularly in poor-prognosis AML groups with specific genetic mutations (Salvestrini2020Denatonium). These findings highlight the complex role of TAS2R43 in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
TAS2R43, a member of the bitter taste receptor family, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the perception of bitter compounds. While specific protein interactions for TAS2R43 are not extensively detailed, it is known that TAS2Rs, including TAS2R43, can form homo- and heterooligomers. However, no functional consequences of these oligomer formations have been detected (Behrens2016G). 

TAS2R43, like other TAS2Rs, is involved in the canonical signal transduction cascade, which involves activation by bitter agonists leading to increased cytosolic calcium levels (Behrens2020StructureFunction). This process is facilitated by interactions with G proteins, such as gustducin, which are crucial for taste signal transduction. The receptor's activation is typically monitored through calcium imaging analyses, which often involve the use of exogenous G proteins to enhance receptor coupling to calcium signaling pathways (Behrens2016G).

The receptor's ability to recognize and respond to bitter compounds is primarily mediated by its molecular receptive range, with minor amino acid changes potentially leading to significant changes in agonist interaction (Meyerhof2011Molecular). Despite these insights, specific interactions of TAS2R43 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored in the available literature.
