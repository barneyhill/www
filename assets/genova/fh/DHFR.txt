# DHFR

## Overview
The DHFR gene encodes the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, a critical component of cellular metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, a reaction essential for the synthesis of nucleotides and certain amino acids, thereby supporting DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Schnell2004Structure; SánchezdelCampo2009Binding). The DHFR protein is a monomeric enzyme that exhibits a complex secondary structure, including an eight-stranded β-sheet and several α-helices, which contribute to its functional rigidity (Goldstein2020Distal). The gene is ubiquitously expressed and subject to intricate regulatory mechanisms, including translational autoregulation and interactions with transcription factors (Blume1991Mithramycin; TAI2004Characterization). Clinically, DHFR is significant due to its role in mediating resistance to antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate, used in cancer therapy, and its genetic variations can influence treatment outcomes (PatiñoGarcía2009Methotrexate; Sridaran2010Antifolate).

## Structure
The human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) is a monomeric protein composed of 186 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 21.5 kDa (Goldstein2020Distal). Its secondary structure features an eight-stranded β-sheet, with seven parallel strands and one carboxy-terminal antiparallel strand. Five α-helices, labeled αB, αC, αE, αE0, and αF, are packed against the β-sheet core. The αE0 helix is perpendicular to αE and may have arisen from a five-residue insertion mutation compared to bacterial DHFR (Goldstein2020Distal). 

hDHFR also includes a left-handed, type II polyproline-like helix, which is absent in Escherichia coli DHFR (ecDHFR), and features a cis-peptide linkage between residues Arg65 and Pro66, as well as another conserved cis-peptide linkage between Gly116 and Gly117 near the nicotinamide binding site (Goldstein2020Distal). The active site cleft is formed at the junction of the larger adenosine binding domain and the smaller loop domain. hDHFR is more rigid than ecDHFR, lacking the Met20 loop subdomain motion observed in ecDHFR (Goldstein2020Distal). The protein's rigidity is attributed to structural differences, such as the insertion of the left-handed polyproline-type helix and a shorter G-H loop (Goldstein2020Distal).

## Function
The human gene DHFR encodes the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is essential for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate, and certain amino acids, which are necessary for DNA synthesis and repair, as well as RNA and protein synthesis (Schnell2004Structure; SánchezdelCampo2009Binding). This enzyme is particularly important in rapidly dividing cells, where it supports cell growth and proliferation by maintaining the cellular pools of THF and its derivatives (Schnell2004Structure).

DHFR is constitutively expressed in all cells, with its expression regulated by various physiological and environmental stimuli, such as the cell cycle and serum stimulation (Blume1991Mithramycin). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with its own mRNA to repress translation, forming a ribonucleoprotein complex that is part of a translational autoregulation mechanism (TAI2004Characterization). This regulation is crucial for maintaining appropriate levels of DHFR within the cell, which can be disrupted by inhibitors like methotrexate, leading to increased DHFR expression and potential drug resistance (TAI2004Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DHFR gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer treatment and drug resistance. In osteosarcoma, variations in DHFR expression levels are linked to methotrexate (MTX) resistance. Lower expression levels of DHFR in initial osteosarcoma biopsy specimens compared to metastases suggest a role in developing resistance to MTX, a chemotherapy drug used in treating this cancer (PatiñoGarcía2009Methotrexate). Increased DHFR expression is commonly observed in cell lines exhibiting an MTX-resistant phenotype, indicating that overexpression may contribute to resistance mechanisms (Neradil2015DHFRmediated).

Genetic polymorphisms in the DHFR gene also influence clinical outcomes. For instance, the G allele of rs1053129 in the DHFR gene is associated with a higher likelihood of metastasis in osteosarcoma patients, suggesting that specific genetic variants can affect the progression of the disease and response to treatment (Jabeen2015Impact). These findings underscore the importance of understanding DHFR gene variations to optimize treatment strategies and manage resistance in cancer therapy. Additionally, mutations in the DHFR gene are linked to antifolate drug resistance in malaria, highlighting the gene's role in broader therapeutic contexts (Sridaran2010Antifolate).

## Interactions
Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, which are crucial for its function and regulation. In the context of protein-protein interactions, DHFR can form complexes with other proteins to facilitate its reassembly from fragments. This process is supported by hetero-oligomerizing proteins, such as the interaction between p21 ras GTPase and its target RBD, and the rapamycin-mediated interaction of the immunophilin FKBP with yeast TOR2. These interactions are essential for the functional reassembly of DHFR fragments, as demonstrated by experiments showing that cell survival occurs only when complementary DHFR fragments fused to interacting proteins are expressed simultaneously (Pelletier1998Oligomerization).

DHFR also interacts with nucleic acids, particularly in the regulation of its gene expression. In mammals, the dhfr gene is regulated by bidirectional promoters that also control the rep3 gene. The major dhfr promoter features interactions with transcription factors such as Sp1 and E2F, which are involved in forming a basal transcription complex and regulating dhfr expression during the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase (Wells1996ProteinDNA). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving DHFR at both the protein and nucleic acid levels.
