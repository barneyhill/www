# PAF1

## Overview
The PAF1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which is involved in various aspects of transcription regulation and chromatin modification. The PAF1 protein, also known as PAF1 homolog, is integral to the function of the PAF1C, which associates with RNA polymerase II to facilitate transcription elongation, histone modification, and RNA processing. As a part of this complex, PAF1 plays a significant role in coordinating transcription with downstream RNA synthesis events, influencing chromatin structure, and regulating gene expression through histone modifications such as H2B monoubiquitylation and H3 methylation (Zhu2005The; Crisucci2011The). The PAF1 complex is also involved in cell cycle regulation, immune response modulation, and maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, highlighting its importance in cellular integrity and function (Tomson2013The; Kenaston2022Transcriptomic). Mutations and dysregulation of PAF1 have been implicated in various cancers, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Xie2018Paf1; Karmakar2018PD2PAF1).

## Structure
The PAF1 protein is a component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation and histone modification regulation. Structurally, PAF1 forms a heterodimer with LEO1 through antiparallel beta-sheet interactions, specifically involving the Pb1 strand of PAF1 and the Lb4 strand of LEO1. This interaction is essential for the assembly of the PAF1/LEO1 subcomplex, which is necessary for binding to histone H3 and the histone octamer (Chu2013Structural). The PAF1 protein also interacts with CTR9, forming a subcomplex that is critical for the assembly and function of the PAF1 complex. The interaction interface between CTR9 and PAF1 involves specific regions and residues, such as the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs in CTR9 and a conserved N-terminal fragment in PAF1 (Xie2018Paf1).

Mutations in PAF1, such as D85N and D95Y, can disrupt its interaction with CTR9, affecting the stability of the PAF1-CTR9 complex (Xie2018Paf1). The PAF1 protein is also involved in the formation of a hook-shaped conformation that binds to the concave channel of CTR9, highlighting its structural complexity and importance in the PAF1 complex assembly (Xie2018Paf1).

## Function
The PAF1 gene encodes a component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which is integral to transcription regulation in healthy human cells. PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II and is involved in transcription elongation, histone modification, and RNA processing. It plays a crucial role in coordinating transcription with downstream RNA synthesis events, influencing chromatin structure and transcription termination through histone modifications such as H2B monoubiquitylation and H3 methylation (Kim2010The; Zhu2005The; Crisucci2011The).

PAF1C is active in the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression by controlling poly(A) site usage, affecting transcript stability and processing (Crisucci2011The). It also interacts with various transcriptional and chromatin remodeling factors, facilitating the recruitment of 3' end processing factors to chromatin and influencing nucleosome dynamics (Tomson2013The).

In addition to its role in transcription, PAF1C is involved in cell cycle regulation, immune response modulation, and maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. It regulates the expression of key transcription factors and signaling pathways essential for cell cycle progression and immune responses (Tomson2013The; Kenaston2022Transcriptomic). These functions underscore the importance of PAF1C in maintaining cellular integrity and proper gene expression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PAF1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Overexpression of PAF1 is linked to pancreatic cancer and cancer stem cell regulation, suggesting its role as an oncogene in these contexts (Xie2018Paf1; Karmakar2018PD2PAF1). Specific mutations in PAF1, such as D85N and D95Y, can disrupt the stability of the PAF1/CTR9 complex, potentially affecting gene regulation processes like histone modifications, which are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions (Xie2018Paf1). These mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis, with PAF1 being associated with pancreatic and ovarian cancers (Xie2018Paf1).

The PAF1 complex (PAF1C) is also involved in immune responses, and its depletion can disrupt interferon-related signaling, increasing susceptibility to viral infections such as dengue and influenza A (Kenaston2022Transcriptomic). Additionally, PAF1C acts as a restriction factor for HIV-1, highlighting its role in antiviral defense (Kenaston2022Transcriptomic). These findings underscore the importance of PAF1 in both cancer progression and immune regulation, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The PAF1 gene encodes a component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. PAF1C interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and is crucial for transcription elongation. It associates with elongation factors such as Spt5 and the Spt16-Pob3 complex, and it has genetic interactions with the RNA polymerase II elongation apparatus (Xie2018Paf1; Squazzo2002The). PAF1C also interacts with transcription elongation factors like DSIF and FACT, and it is involved in histone modifications, including H2B ubiquitination and H3 methylation (Xie2018Paf1; Tomson2013The).

The complex is known to interact with chromatin remodeling factors such as Chd1 and the Ino80 complex, with Cdc73 serving as an anchor point for these interactions (Francette2021The). PAF1C also plays a role in co- and post-transcriptional RNA processing, influencing polyadenylation site selection and the nuclear export of nascent transcripts (Van2017Emerging). Additionally, PAF1C interacts with proteins involved in mRNA export and processing, such as Yra1, Hpr1, Npl3, and Nab2, suggesting a role in determining transcript fate (Fischl2017Paf1).
