# WDPCP

## Overview
The WDPCP gene encodes the WD repeat-containing planar cell polarity effector protein, which is integral to the processes of ciliogenesis and the regulation of planar cell polarity (PCP) in human cells. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulator due to its involvement in stabilizing actin filaments and maintaining cell polarity. WDPCP is crucial for the formation and function of cilia, acting at the ciliary transition zone to facilitate protein trafficking and maintain cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several proteins, including Sept2, to form complexes that are essential for cellular structure and function. Mutations in the WDPCP gene have been linked to various ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Meckel syndrome, underscoring its significance in developmental processes and disease (Cui2013Wdpcp; Park2015The).

## Function
The WDPCP gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and the regulation of planar cell polarity (PCP) in healthy human cells. WDPCP is essential for the formation and function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the cell surface involved in cell signaling and movement. It is active in the ciliary transition zone, where it recruits essential proteins such as Sept2, Mks1, and Nphp1, forming a ring structure that acts as a diffusion barrier to regulate protein trafficking into the ciliary compartment (Cui2013Wdpcp).

WDPCP also modulates the actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for maintaining cell polarity and facilitating directional cell migration. It interacts with Sept2 and actin to stabilize actin filaments, influencing the orientation of the Golgi and the microtubule-organizing center, thereby establishing cell polarity and directional migration (Cui2013Wdpcp). In epithelial cells, WDPCP is involved in maintaining plasma membrane stability by controlling the localization of cortical septins, which are crucial for cortical rigidity (Park2015The). These functions highlight the importance of WDPCP in maintaining cellular structure and signaling pathways, contributing to proper tissue and organ development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDPCP gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Meckel syndrome (MKS). These conditions are characterized by a range of developmental anomalies such as anophthalmia, central polydactyly, kidney cysts, congenital heart defects, facial clefts, and tracheoesophageal fistula (Cui2013Wdpcp). The WDPCP Cys40 mutation, in particular, leads to defects in ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity (PCP), contributing to these syndromes (Cui2013Wdpcp). 

In the cochlea, WDPCP mutations result in disarrayed hair cells and misaligned kinocilia, indicating disrupted PCP, which is crucial for proper auditory function (Cui2013Wdpcp). These mutations also affect the heart, leading to defects in outflow tract septation, a process dependent on PCP (Cui2013Wdpcp). 

WDPCP is also critical for coronary artery development. Mutations can lead to defects in primary ciliogenesis, affecting Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways, which are essential for coronary artery remodeling. This results in structural defects in major coronary arteries, although the initial formation of the primitive coronary plexus remains normal (Liu2018Wdpcp). These findings highlight the gene's role in various developmental processes and its potential impact on conditions related to ciliary dysfunction and disrupted signaling pathways.

## Interactions
The WDPCP protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity. WDPCP interacts with the protein Sept2, forming a complex that is essential for stabilizing actin filaments. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structure of the actin cytoskeleton, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments showing that WDPCP and Sept2 are part of the same protein complex (Cui2013Wdpcp). WDPCP also recruits proteins such as Nphp1, Sept2, and Mks1 to the ciliary transition zone, forming a ring structure with Sept2 that is vital for protein trafficking into the ciliary compartment (Cui2013Wdpcp).

In epithelial cells, WDPCP is necessary for the cortical localization of septins, particularly Sept2, which is crucial for maintaining cortical rigidity and membrane dynamics. Knockdown of WDPCP results in the delocalization of GFP-septin2 from the cell cortex, indicating its role in septin-mediated membrane dynamics (Park2015The). Additionally, WDPCP interacts with Septin7, as its knockdown decreases the expression of Septin7, suggesting a specific interaction that may occur at the transcriptional level (Ma2017WDPCP). These interactions highlight WDPCP's role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and maintaining cellular structures.
