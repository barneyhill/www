# CEP70

## Overview
CEP70, or centrosomal protein 70, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including spermatogenesis, ciliogenesis, and microtubule organization. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein due to its localization and function within the centrosome, a key microtubule-organizing center in cells. CEP70 is integral to the formation and stability of microtubules, interacting with γ-tubulin and other centrosomal proteins to facilitate proper cell division and structural integrity. It is particularly crucial in the development of sperm cells, where it contributes to acrosome biogenesis and flagella formation, and in multiciliated cells, where it aids in centriole amplification. Additionally, CEP70 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in pancreatic cancer, where its overexpression is associated with centrosome abnormalities and tumorigenesis (Yang2014CYLD; Liu2021Loss; Xie2016Cep70).

## Structure


## Function
CEP70 (centrosomal protein 70) is a crucial component in various cellular processes, particularly in spermatogenesis and ciliogenesis. In healthy human cells, CEP70 is highly expressed during spermatogenesis, especially in spermatocytes and spermatids, where it plays a significant role in acrosome biogenesis and flagella formation. It is primarily localized in the acrosome and neck of sperm cells, contributing to the development of these structures essential for normal sperm function (Ruan2023Identification; Liu2021Loss).

CEP70 is also involved in the dynamic regulation of microtubules, interacting with γ-tubulin through its coiled-coil domains. This interaction is vital for the extension and stability of microtubules, which are necessary for proper cell division and structure (Liu2021Loss). In the context of ciliogenesis, CEP70 is deubiquitinated by CYLD, enhancing its interaction with γ-tubulin and promoting its localization at the centrosome. This process is crucial for the formation and function of cilia, as it supports the assembly of microtubule triplets, essential components of centrioles and basal bodies (Yang2014CYLD).

CEP70's role extends to centriole amplification in multiciliated cells, where it forms complexes with proteins like CCDC78 and Deup1, facilitating centriole biogenesis (Kim2021A). Its depletion leads to significant defects in centriole formation and cilia development, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Kim2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CEP70 gene have been linked to several conditions, particularly male infertility and cancer. In the context of male infertility, biallelic variants in CEP70 have been identified in patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology. These mutations are associated with significant morphological abnormalities in sperm, including defects in the acrosome and flagella, and a lack of detectable CEP70 protein, suggesting a recessive inheritance pattern (Ruan2023Identification). Similarly, a heterozygous mutation in CEP70 has been linked to azoospermia, the absence of sperm in semen, which is a major cause of male infertility (Liu2021Loss).

In cancer, CEP70 is implicated in pancreatic cancer, where it is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissue. This overexpression is associated with centrosome abnormalities and microtubule disorganization, contributing to tumorigenesis. Depletion of CEP70 in pancreatic cancer cells reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in promoting cancer cell survival and growth (Xie2016Cep70). These findings suggest that CEP70 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer (Xie2016Cep70).

## Interactions
CEP70, a centrosomal protein, is involved in several critical interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with γ-tubulin, a key component of the microtubule organizing center, through its coiled-coil domains. This interaction is crucial for the localization of CEP70 at the centrosome and is modulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, which removes polyubiquitin chains from CEP70, enhancing its interaction with γ-tubulin (Yang2014CYLD).

CEP70 also forms a complex with deuterosome proteins CCDC78 and Deup1, which is essential for centriole amplification in multiciliated cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that CEP70, CCDC78, and Deup1 work together in centriole biogenesis (Kim2021A).

In the context of cancer, CEP70 interacts with centrosomal proteins such as γ-tubulin and pericentrin, affecting centrosome integrity and microtubule organization. Overexpression of CEP70 in pancreatic cancer cells leads to centrosome abnormalities and microtubule disorganization, suggesting a physical interaction that impacts cell division and tumor growth (Xie2016Cep70).

CEP70's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in centrosome function, ciliogenesis, and cancer biology.
