# PKP2

## Overview
Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) is a gene that encodes the plakophilin 2 protein, a critical component of desmosomes, which are specialized structures involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in cardiac tissue. The plakophilin 2 protein is characterized by its armadillo repeat domain, which facilitates interactions with other desmosomal proteins, contributing to the structural integrity and function of desmosomes (AlJassar2013Mechanistic; Kirchner2012Molecular). PKP2 plays a significant role in maintaining cardiac tissue integrity and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of β-catenin signaling and potential nuclear functions (Chen2002Protein; Neuber2010The). Mutations in the PKP2 gene are primarily associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a genetic disorder that can lead to severe cardiac complications (Gerull2004Mutations; Novelli2018Pleiotropic). The plakophilin 2 protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms underscore its importance in both cellular adhesion and signaling pathways, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular and cardiac function.

## Structure
Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) is a protein characterized by its armadillo repeat domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other desmosomal proteins. The armadillo domain of PKP2 contains nine ARM repeats, each typically consisting of three α-helices, except for repeats R1 and R6, which lack the H1 helix (Kirchner2012Molecular). This domain is essential for the structural integrity of desmosomes, as it facilitates interactions with proteins like desmoplakin and plakoglobin (AlJassar2013Mechanistic).

Mutations in PKP2 can lead to structural instability and degradation of the protein. For instance, the C752R mutation results in a destabilized protein due to the clash of the arginine side chain with other residues, leading to degradation (Kirchner2012Molecular). The tertiary structure of PKP2 is stabilized by these armadillo repeats, forming a compact helical bundle (Kirchner2012Molecular).

PKP2 also exists in two splice variants, which are coexpressed in all analyzed cell types (Neuber2010The). These variants may have distinct functional properties, contributing to the protein's role in desmosomal adhesion and signaling. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate PKP2's nuclear accumulation and interaction with other proteins (Neuber2010The).

## Function
Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) is a crucial component of desmosomes, which are structures that facilitate cell-cell adhesion, particularly in cardiac tissue. PKP2 is involved in linking the intermediate filament-binding protein desmoplakin (DP) to desmosomal cadherins, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (BassZubek2008Plakophilin). It acts as a scaffold for a complex involving DP and protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), essential for the proper assembly of DP into desmosomes. PKP2 deficiency disrupts this complex, leading to impaired junction assembly and increased phosphorylation of PKC substrates (BassZubek2008Plakophilin).

PKP2 is also involved in the regulation of β-catenin signaling activity, which is crucial for cellular signaling and structural integrity. It can associate with non-cadherin-bound β-catenin and regulate its signaling activity, suggesting a role in cross-talk between intercellular junctions and signal transduction pathways (Chen2002Protein). PKP2's presence in the nucleus and its interaction with components of the RNA polymerase III holoenzyme indicate potential nuclear functions, although these are not fully understood (Chen2002Protein; Neuber2010The). PKP2 is essential for heart morphogenesis and cardiac junction formation, as demonstrated by the lethal heart defects observed in PKP2-deficient mouse embryos (Grossmann2004Requirement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PKP2 gene are primarily associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a genetic disorder characterized by the replacement of cardiac myocytes with fibrofatty tissue, leading to ventricular arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (Gerull2004Mutations; Novelli2018Pleiotropic). PKP2 mutations account for a significant proportion of genotype-positive cases of ARVC, with various types of mutations identified, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations (Gerull2004Mutations; Novelli2018Pleiotropic). These mutations often result in impaired desmosomal function, which is crucial for maintaining cardiac tissue integrity (Gerull2004Mutations).

The clinical presentation of ARVC due to PKP2 mutations can vary widely, with some carriers exhibiting severe symptoms such as ventricular tachycardia and heart failure, while others may remain asymptomatic (Leone2021Phenotypic; Li2013Identification). The disease often shows incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, complicating diagnosis and management (Leone2021Phenotypic; Gerull2004Mutations). Genetic testing and family screening are essential for identifying at-risk individuals and implementing preventative measures, such as lifestyle modifications and medical interventions (Leone2021Phenotypic).

## Interactions
Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily within desmosomes, which are critical for cell-cell adhesion. PKP2 interacts with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. These interactions are mediated by the head domain of PKP2, which is crucial for its localization to cell borders (Chen2002Protein). PKP2 also associates with β-catenin, influencing β-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This interaction is competitive with E-cadherin, suggesting that PKP2 and E-cadherin vie for the same pool of signaling-active β-catenin (Chen2002Protein).

PKP2 plays a role in restricting influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with the PB1 protein of the viral polymerase complex. This interaction blocks the assembly of the IAV polymerase complex by preventing PB1 from binding to PB2, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Wang2017Comparative).

In the nucleus, PKP2 associates with components of the RNA-polymerase-III holoenzyme, although the functional significance of this interaction remains unclear (Neuber2010The). PKP2 is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may influence its localization and stability (Hatzfeld2014Plakophilins).
