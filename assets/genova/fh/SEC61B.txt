# SEC61B

## Overview
The SEC61B gene encodes the beta subunit of the SEC61 translocon complex, a critical component in the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The SEC61 translocon is a heterotrimeric complex composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, with SEC61B playing a pivotal role in its structural and functional integrity. The protein encoded by SEC61B, known as the SEC61 translocon subunit beta, is characterized by a conserved transmembrane domain that anchors it within the ER membrane, facilitating its interactions with other translocon components and auxiliary proteins (Sicking2021Lights; Leroux2008InterSpecies). This subunit is involved in both co-translational and post-translational protein translocation processes and contributes to ER calcium homeostasis by functioning as a passive calcium leak channel (Linxweiler2017Let’s). Alterations in SEC61B expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including polycystic liver disease and diabetes mellitus, highlighting its clinical significance (Kong2024Identification; Lang2017An).

## Structure
The SEC61B gene encodes the beta subunit of the SEC61 translocon complex, which is involved in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The primary structure of SEC61B includes a highly conserved transmembrane domain (TMD), which is crucial for its function. This TMD is a hydrophobic region predicted to form an alpha helix that spans the lipid bilayer, with the N-terminus exposed to the cytoplasm (Leroux2008InterSpecies). The TMD is sufficient for functional complementation across species, indicating its essential role in the protein's activity (Leroux2008InterSpecies).

The secondary structure of SEC61B is characterized by the presence of this alpha-helical TMD, which acts as a tail anchor and ER localization signal (Leroux2008InterSpecies). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the TMD to facilitate interactions with other transmembrane proteins, potentially forming dimers (Leroux2008InterSpecies).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEC61B is part of the SEC61 complex, associating with the alpha and gamma subunits to form a functional translocon. This assembly is crucial for its role in protein translocation (Zhao2009Functional). The TMD's interactions with conserved proteins suggest a scaffolding or recruiting function within the complex (Leroux2008InterSpecies).

## Function
The SEC61B gene encodes the beta subunit of the SEC61 translocon complex, which is essential for the translocation and insertion of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This complex is composed of three subunits: α, β, and γ, with SEC61B being the beta subunit. The SEC61 complex forms a channel that facilitates the passage of nascent polypeptide chains through the ER membrane, a process that is crucial for the biogenesis of many transmembrane and secretory proteins (Linxweiler2017Let’s; Parys2022Sec61).

The SEC61 complex operates both co-translationally and post-translationally. In the co-translational pathway, the signal recognition particle (SRP) guides the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the SEC61 channel. In the post-translational pathway, proteins are fully synthesized in the cytosol before being translocated into the ER (Linxweiler2017Let’s). The SEC61 complex also functions as a passive ER calcium leak channel, playing a role in cellular calcium homeostasis (Linxweiler2017Let’s).

In healthy human cells, the SEC61 complex is involved in maintaining low basal cytoplasmic calcium levels by allowing calcium to leak from the ER into the cytoplasm, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Kong2024Identification). The SEC61B subunit, while not extensively detailed in the context, is integral to the overall function of the SEC61 translocon in protein translocation and calcium homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEC61B gene have been implicated in various diseases. A heterozygous mutation in SEC61B is associated with polycystic liver disease, which results from a precursor-specific ER protein import defect. This defect affects the presence of certain plasma membrane proteins, such as polycystin 1, involved in planar cell polarity (Lang2017An). 

In the context of diabetes mellitus, SEC61B is upregulated in platelets and megakaryocytes, potentially due to ER stress. This upregulation is linked to increased calcium permeability, contributing to elevated cytosolic calcium levels and platelet hyperreactivity, which may increase cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients (Kong2024Identification). 

Alterations in SEC61B expression have also been associated with colorectal cancer, although specific mechanisms remain less clear (Parys2022Sec61). The SEC61 translocon, including SEC61B, plays a role in ER calcium leak, and its dysregulation can lead to various pathophysiological conditions, including ER stress and related diseases (Parys2022Sec61). These findings suggest that SEC61B could serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Interactions
SEC61B, a subunit of the SEC61 translocon complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with other components of the SEC61 complex, such as SEC61α and SEC61γ, forming a heterotrimeric structure essential for protein translocation across the ER membrane (Sicking2021Lights). SEC61B also interacts with auxiliary proteins like Sec63, which is part of the Sec62/Sec63 complex, playing a role in the translocon complex during protein transport (Sicking2021Lights). This interaction is significant, as demonstrated by strong luminescence signals in bimolecular luminescence complementation assays (Sicking2021Lights).

In addition to its role in the SEC61 complex, SEC61B is implicated in modulating sensitivity to platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents through its interaction with the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A. Although SEC61B and ATP7A do not stably bind, they are both enriched in membrane lipid rafts, suggesting a role for SEC61B in the partitioning or trafficking of ATP7A (Abada2012Sec61β). This interaction influences drug resistance mechanisms, particularly in the context of cancer treatment (Abada2012Sec61β).
