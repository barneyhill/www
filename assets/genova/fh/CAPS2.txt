# CAPS2

## Overview
CAPS2, or calcyphosine 2, is a gene that encodes the protein calcyphosine 2, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. The protein is categorized as a secretory granule-associated protein and plays a significant role in the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a critical factor for synapse formation and brain development. CAPS2 has been implicated in neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), due to its involvement in neurotrophic signaling and regulation of the social peptide oxytocin. Research has shown that CAPS2-deficient mice exhibit behaviors analogous to human autism, such as impaired social interaction and anxiety, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopmental processes (Sadakata2012Autistic‐like; Sadakata2009Developmentally). Additionally, CAPS2 has been linked to pancreatic health, with deficiencies potentially contributing to pancreatic acinar cell injury (Sato2022Loss).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAPS2 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, most notably autism spectrum disorders (ASD). CAPS2 is involved in the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is crucial for synapse formation and brain development. CAPS2-deficient mice exhibit autistic-like behaviors, such as impaired social interaction, hyperactivity, and anxiety, which are reminiscent of autism in humans (Sadakata2012Autistic‐like; Sadakata2009Developmentally). In humans, some autistic patients have been found to express an aberrant splicing variant of CAPS2, specifically the skipping of exon 3, which is not observed in healthy controls (Sadakata2007Autisticlike). This aberrant splicing has also been identified in autistic monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic component to the condition (Sadakata2009Developmentally).

CAPS2 is also linked to the regulation of the social peptide oxytocin, with CAPS2 deficiency leading to reduced oxytocin release and impaired social behavior in mice, further implicating its role in ASD (Fujima2021CAPS2). Additionally, CAPS2 has been associated with chronic pancreatitis, as CAPS2 deficiency in mice leads to pancreatic acinar cell injury and intracellular accumulation of secretory granules, suggesting a potential link between CAPS2 mutations and pancreatic pathology (Sato2022Loss).
