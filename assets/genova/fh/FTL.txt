# FTL

## Overview
The FTL gene encodes the ferritin light chain, a key component of the ferritin protein complex, which plays a crucial role in iron storage and regulation within human cells. Ferritin is a spherical protein complex composed of 24 subunits, which can be either ferritin light (FTL) or heavy (FTH1) chains. While the FTL subunit lacks the catalytic activity of the FTH1 subunit, it is essential for the nucleation and storage of iron, contributing to the stability and function of the ferritin complex (Harrison1996The; Vidal2004Intracellular). The ferritin light chain is involved in various cellular processes, including cytodifferentiation and mineralization, and plays a role in maintaining iron homeostasis, preventing oxidative damage, and supporting tissue regeneration (Hou2012Role). Mutations in the FTL gene are linked to disorders such as neuroferritinopathy and hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, underscoring its importance in human health (Cozzi2021Pathogenic; Chinnery2006Clinical).

## Structure
The FTL gene encodes the ferritin light chain, a subunit of the ferritin protein complex involved in iron storage. The primary structure of the ferritin light chain consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a specific arrangement of alpha helices in its secondary structure (Harrison1996The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a compact form, which is crucial for its function in iron storage (Plays2021Chemistry). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the ferritin light chain assembles with ferritin heavy chains to form a spherical shell composed of 24 subunits. This assembly creates a nanocage capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms (Plays2021Chemistry; Harrison1996The). The ferritin light chain lacks the ferroxidase activity found in the heavy chain but plays a significant role in the formation of the iron core, contributing to the overall stability and function of the ferritin complex (Harrison1996The).

Post-translational modifications of the ferritin light chain include acetylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its stability and function. The structure of ferritin is highly conserved across species, despite variations in amino acid sequences (Harrison1996The).

## Function
The FTL gene encodes the ferritin light chain, a crucial component of the ferritin protein complex responsible for iron storage and regulation in human cells. Ferritin is composed of 24 subunits, which can be either ferritin light polypeptide (FTL) or ferritin heavy polypeptide (FTH1). These subunits assemble into a hollow shell that sequesters iron in a soluble, non-toxic form, preventing oxidative damage and maintaining iron homeostasis (Vidal2004Intracellular).

In healthy human cells, the FTL subunit lacks catalytic activity but provides acidic residues on the surface cavity that facilitate iron nucleation. This is essential for the storage of iron, as it allows the formation of iron cores within the ferritin complex (Vidal2004Intracellular). The FTL subunit is involved in iron storage but does not directly participate in iron oxidation, which is primarily the role of the FTH1 subunit (Harrison1996The).

Ferritin, including the FTL subunit, plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cytodifferentiation and mineralization, particularly in periodontal ligament cells. This indicates its importance in maintaining the homeostasis of periodontal tissues and potentially in bone remodeling, wound healing, and tissue regeneration (Hou2012Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FTL gene, which encodes the ferritin light chain, are associated with several disorders, primarily neuroferritinopathy and hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome (HHCS). Neuroferritinopathy is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by iron accumulation in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia, leading to movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, and parkinsonism, as well as cognitive decline (Cozzi2021Pathogenic; Chinnery2006Clinical). This condition is linked to mutations in exon 4 of the FTL gene, which result in altered ferritin structure and impaired iron storage, causing oxidative stress and cellular damage (Mancuso2005Hereditary; Vidal2004Intracellular).

HHCS is caused by mutations in the 5′ UTR of the FTL gene, which disrupt iron regulatory protein (IRP) binding, leading to uncontrolled L-ferritin expression and cataract formation (Cozzi2021Pathogenic). Other mutations in the FTL gene can lead to benign hyperferritinemia or haploinsufficiency without significant clinical symptoms (Cozzi2021Pathogenic). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of FTL in maintaining iron homeostasis and the potential consequences of its dysregulation.

## Interactions
The ferritin light chain (FTL) protein is involved in several significant interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of viral infections. FTL acts as a coreceptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), facilitating its attachment and entry into cells. It interacts with the preS region of the HBV surface antigen and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1), forming a complex that enhances viral binding and entry into hepatocytes. The binding motif for FTL to the preS region is located at the α-helix A, while its interaction with SCCA1 involves helices B, C, D, and E (Hao2012Ferritin).

FTL also interacts with the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF1-encoded macro domain protein. This interaction inhibits the secretion of ferritin in hepatoma cells, although it does not alter the expression levels of FTL or other proteins involved in iron metabolism. The HEV-macro domain's interaction with FTL is specific and has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid experiments and co-affinity purification. This interaction may play a role in modulating the host's immune response during HEV infection by preventing ferritin from entering circulation (Ojha2016Hepatitis).
