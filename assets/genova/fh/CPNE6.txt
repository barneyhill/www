# CPNE6

## Overview
CPNE6 is a gene that encodes the protein Copine 6, a member of the Copine family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. This protein is primarily involved in synaptic function and neuronal development, particularly within the central nervous system. As a calcium sensor, Copine 6 plays a crucial role in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory formation by facilitating the activation of signaling pathways that control actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Reinhard2016The). The CPNE6 gene has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and depression, due to its significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion; Fang2020Quercetin). Additionally, alterations in CPNE6 expression and function are associated with diseases affecting memory, such as Alzheimer's disease and Fragile X syndrome, highlighting its importance in maintaining cognitive health (Reinhard2016The).

## Structure
The CPNE6 protein, also known as Copine 6, is a member of the Copine family of calcium sensor proteins. It has a molecular weight of approximately 61,991 Da, with potential post-translational modifications increasing this to 62,071 Da (Khvotchev2024Copines). The primary structure of CPNE6 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains: the C2A domain (S20-V147), the C2B domain (Y153-E290), and the VWA domain (Q304-S536) (Khvotchev2024Copines). These domains contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, with the C2A and C2B domains involved in calcium-dependent membrane association. The C2B domain is particularly critical for this function (Khvotchev2024Copines).

The tertiary structure of Copine proteins, including CPNE6, is described as butterfly-like, with the C2A and C2B domains forming the 'wings' and the VWA domain forming the 'body' (Khvotchev2024Copines). The C2A domain is closely aligned with the VWA domain, while the C2B domain protrudes sideways, which is important for the protein's function in calcium signaling (Khvotchev2024Copines). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the protein's interaction with membranes suggests a potential for oligomerization or complex formation (Khvotchev2024Copines). The excerpt does not provide specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for CPNE6, but it mentions that alternative splicing can lead to isoforms with deletions or alternative N-terminal sequences in Copine proteins (Khvotchev2024Copines).

## Function
Copine 6 (CPNE6) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that plays a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal development, particularly within the central nervous system. It acts as a calcium sensor in neurons, where it is involved in regulating spine structural plasticity, which is crucial for synaptic strength and memory formation (Reinhard2016The). Copine 6 translocates to postsynaptic spines in response to calcium influx, facilitating the activation of the Rac1-PAK-LIMK1-Cofilin signaling pathway, which is responsible for actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (Reinhard2016The).

In healthy human cells, Copine 6 is involved in the recruitment of the Rac1-PAK complex to spines, a process necessary for the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the enlargement of spine heads during long-term potentiation (LTP) (Reinhard2016The). It also interacts with the TrkB receptor, influencing its recycling to the cell surface and modulating synaptic strength and plasticity through brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways (Burk2017Regulation). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining synaptic stability and strength, impacting synaptic plasticity and connectivity in the hippocampus (Burk2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CPNE6 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. CPNE6 is identified as a candidate gene for intellectual disability (ID), with mutations leading to comparable phenotypes among affected individuals (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion). The gene's role in synaptic plasticity and learning suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorders, as synaptic transmission and plasticity are common risk factors in these conditions (Guevara2021Comparative).

Alterations in CPNE6 expression are also linked to depression-like behaviors. In a study involving rats, quercetin treatment was shown to alleviate these behaviors by regulating the imbalance of CPNE6 and other proteins related to neuroplasticity and inflammation (Fang2020Quercetin). This suggests that CPNE6 plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, potentially through its involvement in the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway (Fang2020Quercetin).

Additionally, CPNE6 is part of the Rac1-PAK-LIMK1-Cofilin pathway, which is implicated in diseases affecting memory, such as Fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and Williams-Beuren syndrome. Alterations in this pathway, regulated by CPNE6, could be associated with these conditions (Reinhard2016The).

## Interactions
Copine-6 (CPNE6) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. It interacts with Rac1, a Rho-like GTPase, which is essential for actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This interaction is independent of Copine-6's calcium-binding ability, with the second C2 domain of Copine-6 being necessary and sufficient for Rac1 binding. Copine-6 enhances Rac1 activation, leading to increased levels of active Rac1-GTP, which is crucial for the recruitment of Rac1 into spines, necessary for spine structural plasticity (Reinhard2016The).

Copine-6 also participates in the Rac1-PAK-LIMK1-Cofilin signaling pathway, which controls actin dynamics in spines. This pathway is vital for the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP). In Cpne6 knockout neurons, defects in this signaling pathway result in decreased phosphorylation of Cofilin and impaired LTP maintenance (Reinhard2016The).

The interaction between Copine-6 and Rac1 involves both inactive and active forms of Rac1, and the complex includes phosphorylated PAK1. Although Copine-6 lacks domains for GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) or guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), it likely recruits Rac1 to spines, facilitating its activation by PSD-residing enzymes (Reinhard2016The).
