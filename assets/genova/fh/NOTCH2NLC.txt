# NOTCH2NLC

## Overview
The NOTCH2NLC gene is a member of the human-specific NOTCH2NL gene family, which is implicated in the regulation of cortical neurogenesis and the evolutionary expansion of the human brain. This gene encodes the notch 2 N-terminal like C protein, which is involved in enhancing Notch signaling pathways crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells. The NOTCH2NLC protein is particularly significant in the context of human brain development, as it is expressed in radial glia cells and has been shown to influence the production of neurons by interacting with NOTCH receptors. Additionally, mutations and repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 3 (OPDM3), highlighting its clinical significance in neuropathology (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Cao2021NOTCH2NLCrelated; Yu2021The).

## Function
The NOTCH2NLC gene is part of the human-specific NOTCH2NL gene family, which plays a significant role in cortical neurogenesis and the evolutionary expansion of the human cortex. These genes are involved in the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and are expressed in the germinal zones of the developing human cortex, particularly in outer radial glia cells. NOTCH2NL genes, including NOTCH2NLC, enhance Notch signaling, which is crucial for maintaining the proliferation of radial glia stem cells and determining the number of neurons in the cortex. This enhancement occurs through interactions with NOTCH receptors, where NOTCH2NL proteins can physically interact with and activate these receptors, influencing both intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways (Fiddes2018Human-Specific).

The NOTCH2NLC gene is expressed in human fetal brain samples, specifically in radial glia cells, and its expression has been confirmed in cortical organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells. This suggests a role in human-specific aspects of brain development, contributing to the delay in differentiation and increased neuron production during fetal brain development (Fiddes2018Human-Specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to NOTCH2NLC is neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), characterized by eosinophilic ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the nervous system. NIID presents with symptoms such as dementia, parkinsonism, tremor, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy (Cao2021NOTCH2NLCrelated). GGC repeat expansions in the 5' untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC are a key feature of NIID and are prevalent in Asian populations (Cao2021NOTCH2NLCrelated).

These repeat expansions are also implicated in other disorders, including oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 3 (OPDM3), where they are considered a genetic cause (Yu2021The). The expansions have been associated with various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism-related disorders, multiple system atrophy, essential tremor, adult leukoencephalopathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Yu2021GGC). In particular, adult leukoencephalopathy has been frequently linked to NOTCH2NLC expansions, making it a significant genetic factor in these conditions (Okubo2019GGC).

The pathological mechanism is thought to involve a toxic protein gain-of-function, where the expanded repeats lead to the production of a toxic NOTCH2NLC-polyglycine protein, contributing to cell toxicity and death (Yu2021The).

## Interactions
The NOTCH2NLC protein is involved in several interactions at the protein level, particularly in the context of oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 3 (OPDM3). In OPDM3 patients, the NOTCH2NLC protein co-localizes with p62 in intranuclear inclusions and rimmed vacuoles within muscle fibers, suggesting a physical interaction between NOTCH2NLC and p62 (Yu2021The). This co-localization is not observed in control subjects or patients with oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 2 (OPDM2), indicating a specific interaction in OPDM3 pathology (Yu2021The).

The mutant NOTCH2NLC gene is hypothesized to translate into a toxic NOTCH2NLC-polyglycine (polyG) protein, which forms aggregates in the nucleus and contributes to cellular toxicity and death. These aggregates also co-localize with the RNA-binding protein MBNL1 and p62 in intranuclear inclusions, suggesting interactions at the protein level (Yu2021The). In HEK293 cells expressing the mutant NOTCH2NLC, partial co-localization of p62 or MBNL1 with intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant NOTCH2NLC-polyG protein has been observed (Yu2021The). These findings indicate that NOTCH2NLC may interact with RNA-binding proteins and p62, contributing to the pathology of OPDM3 (Yu2021The).
