# UBE2N

## Overview
UBE2N is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N, a crucial component of the ubiquitination pathway, which is involved in tagging proteins for various cellular processes, including degradation. The enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and plays a pivotal role in the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are primarily associated with non-proteolytic functions such as DNA repair, signal transduction, and immune responses (SánchezMartín2015Ubiquitin; Song2020Inhibiting). UBE2N interacts with various E3 ligases, including TRIM21 and ZNRF1, to facilitate these processes, and its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Behera2018Structural; Kiss2019A). The gene's involvement in critical cellular functions underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Song2020Inhibiting; Yin2014Aged).

## Structure
UBE2N, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N, is a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation or other cellular processes. The enzyme contains a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is crucial for its function. UBE2N typically forms a heterodimer with UBE2V1 or UBE2V2, influencing its quaternary structure and enabling the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains (Kiss2019A).

The interaction of UBE2N with E3 ligases, such as TRIM21 and ZNRF1, is characterized by specific structural features. In the case of TRIM21, UBE2N is held in a closed conformation by a tri-ionic anchor mechanism involving specific electrostatic interactions with residues E12, E13, and D21 of TRIM21. This interaction is crucial for maintaining UBE2N in its active conformation, facilitating ubiquitination (Kiss2019A). The crystal structure of the TRIM21-RING domain in complex with a UBE2N~ubiquitin conjugate has been solved to 2.8 Å resolution, providing detailed insights into these interactions (Kiss2019A).

In its interaction with ZNRF1, UBE2N forms a high-affinity complex characterized by specific salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds, particularly involving Glu183 of ZNRF1 and Arg14/Lys10 of UBE2N. This interaction is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Behera2018Structural).

## Function
UBE2N, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N, is a key player in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein regulation within cells. It specifically facilitates the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are involved in non-proteolytic signaling pathways rather than targeting proteins for degradation. This type of ubiquitination is crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and immune responses (SánchezMartín2015Ubiquitin; Song2020Inhibiting).

UBE2N operates in conjunction with E3 ligases, such as the malin-laforin complex, to mediate the ubiquitination of target proteins. This interaction is significant for the regulation of autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway, and is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis (SánchezMartín2015Ubiquitin). UBE2N is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability and the regulation of transcriptional activation (Song2020Inhibiting).

In healthy human cells, UBE2N's role in these molecular processes supports critical functions such as cell cycle progression and response to cellular stress, thereby influencing overall organismal health and stability (SánchezMartín2015Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2N (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in the ubiquitination process. In cancer, UBE2N is implicated in the progression and growth of several types, including cervical carcinoma, melanoma, and neuroblastoma. In cervical carcinoma, elevated UBE2N expression is associated with shorter overall survival, and its knockdown inhibits cell growth by affecting MAPK signaling pathways (Song2020Inhibiting). In melanoma, UBE2N promotes tumor growth through the MEK/FRA1/SOX10 signaling pathway, and its inhibition reduces melanoma proliferation (Dikshit2018UBE2N). In neuroblastoma, UBE2N affects p53 localization, and its inhibition by NSC697923 induces apoptosis through p53 and JNK pathways, offering a potential therapeutic strategy (Cheng2014A).

UBE2N is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In aged monkey brains, increased UBE2N expression is linked to the accumulation of mutant huntingtin, contributing to neurodegenerative processes (Yin2014Aged). Additionally, UBE2N is crucial for mitochondrial quality control in Parkinson's disease, where its knockdown impairs mitophagy (Geisler2014UBE2N). These findings highlight UBE2N's clinical significance in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
UBE2N, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes. UBE2N interacts with Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to facilitate the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on depolarized mitochondria, a key step in Parkin-dependent mitophagy (Geisler2014UBE2N). This interaction is essential for the autophagic degradation of mitochondrial proteins (Geisler2014UBE2N).

UBE2N also forms complexes with TRIM ligases, such as TRIM21, where it is recruited through a tri-ionic anchor mechanism. This interaction is specific to UBE2N and is crucial for K63-chain ubiquitination, which is important for TRIM21's cellular functions, including immune signaling (Kiss2019A). The tri-ionic motif involves specific residues that form salt bridges with UBE2N, promoting the closed UBE2N~Ub conformation necessary for its catalytic activity (Kiss2019A).

Additionally, UBE2N interacts with the ubiquitin ligase RNF167, promoting the ubiquitination of the AMPA receptor, which is significant for regulating receptor function (Ghilarducci2021Functional). These interactions highlight UBE2N's role in various cellular processes, including mitophagy, immune response, and receptor regulation.
