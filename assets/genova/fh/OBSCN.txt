# OBSCN

## Overview
The OBSCN gene encodes the protein obscurin, a large cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in muscle structure and function. Obscurin is characterized by its modular architecture, comprising multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains, as well as signaling motifs such as the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. This protein is primarily involved in the organization and stabilization of sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of muscle cells, by interacting with other key structural proteins like titin and myomesin. Obscurin's diverse isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing, allow it to participate in various cellular processes, including myofibrillogenesis, calcium handling, and cytoskeletal organization. Mutations in the OBSCN gene have been implicated in several muscle and cardiac diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining muscle integrity and function (Fukuzawa2006Complete; Grogan2018Unraveling; Manring2017Obscure).

## Structure
The OBSCN gene encodes the protein obscurin, a giant modular protein primarily involved in muscle structure and function. Obscurin is composed of multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains, with a total of 65 Ig domains and 2 Fn3 domains identified in obscurin A (Fukuzawa2006Complete). The protein also contains signaling motifs, including an IQ motif, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) domain, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Guardia2021Obscurin:; Young2001Obscurin).

Obscurin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with obscurin A (~720 kDa) and obscurin B (~870 kDa) being the most characterized. These isoforms differ in their COOH-termini; obscurin A has ankyrin binding sites, while obscurin B contains two active Ser/Thr kinase domains (Guardia2021Obscurin:; Marston2017Obscurin). The protein's structure is highly modular, with tandem Ig domains similar to those in titin, contributing to its role in sarcomere assembly and integrity (Bang2001The; Young2001Obscurin).

Obscurin's domains are encoded on separate exons, allowing for extensive splicing variability, which results in numerous isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Fukuzawa2006Complete; Young2001Obscurin). The protein's kinase domains show weak homology to myosin light chain kinases, suggesting unique regulatory roles (Fukuzawa2006Complete).

## Function
The OBSCN gene encodes obscurin, a large protein that plays a critical role in the structural organization and function of muscle cells. Obscurin is primarily involved in myofibrillogenesis, the process of assembling sarcomeric proteins into functional sarcomeres, which are the fundamental contractile units of muscle cells (Manring2017Obscure). It localizes to the M-band and Z-disk of sarcomeres, where it interacts with proteins such as titin and myomesin, contributing to the assembly and stability of thick filaments and the overall sarcomeric structure (Manring2017Obscure; Kontrogianni‐Konstantopoulos2006Obscurin).

Obscurin also plays a role in linking the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to the myofibrils, which is crucial for calcium handling and muscle contraction (Fukuzawa2006Complete). It interacts with small ankyrin 1, an integral component of the network SR, to maintain calcium homeostasis and ensure proper muscle function (Manring2017Obscure). Additionally, obscurin's kinase domains are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, interacting with proteins at adherens junctions to regulate cell contractility and maintain subcellular structures (Hu2013The). These functions highlight obscurin's essential role in maintaining muscle integrity and facilitating muscle contraction and relaxation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OBSCN gene, which encodes the protein obscurin, are associated with several cardiac and muscle diseases. In cardiomyopathies, OBSCN mutations have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC). Specific mutations such as R4344Q and A4484T are implicated in HCM, with the R4344Q mutation affecting calcium cycling and contributing to arrhythmias (Grogan2018Unraveling; Hu2017Deregulated). In DCM, mutations like E963K and V2161D may lead to reduced obscurin expression, impacting cardiac function (Grogan2018Unraveling). 

OBSCN mutations are also associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), where they contribute to structural and functional abnormalities in heart muscle cells, potentially leading to arrhythmias due to imbalanced calcium currents (Chen2020Intracellular). Beyond cardiomyopathies, OBSCN mutations have been linked to muscle diseases such as distal muscular dystrophy and chronic systolic heart failure (Grogan2018Unraveling). Additionally, OBSCN mutations may play a role in certain cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer, by contributing to tumor formation and progression (Grogan2018Unraveling).

## Interactions
The OBSCN gene encodes the protein obscurin, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for muscle function and cellular signaling. Obscurin interacts with titin, a key structural protein in muscle cells. Specifically, the N-terminal domains of obscurin interact with the M-line titin and myomesin, anchoring obscurin to the M-line complex and contributing to its stability. The titin M10 Ig domain interacts with the N-terminal Ig domain of obscurin, while the myomesin Ig domain 4 interacts with the third Ig domain of obscurin (Marston2017Obscurin). Obscurin domains Ig58/Ig59 also interact with titin Ig domains Z9/Z10, anchoring obscurin to the Z-disk (Rossi2017A).

Obscurin's C-terminal sAnk1 binding site links the contractile sarcomere to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, which is significant for SR alignment and anchoring around the developing myofibril during contraction (Marston2017Obscurin). The PH domain of obscurin interacts with Rho proteins, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP in small GTPases like RhoA and RhoQ, which is important for normal myofibril growth and pathologic hypertrophy (Marston2017Obscurin). Obscurin also interacts with a novel isoform of skeletal MyBP-C, suggesting its involvement in myofibril and SR development (Marston2017Obscurin).
