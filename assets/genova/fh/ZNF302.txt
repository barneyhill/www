# ZNF302

## Overview
ZNF302 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 302, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in humans. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression. As part of the KRAB-ZNF subfamily, zinc finger protein 302 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The gene is located in the 19q13.11 region, a locus associated with microdeletion syndromes that can lead to developmental and neurodevelopmental disorders. ZNF302 has been implicated in congenital heart disease and other conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Jiang2018Genome‐wide; AlNaama2020C2H2Type; Gana201219q13.11).

## Function
ZNF302 (zinc finger protein 302) is a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is the largest transcription factor family in humans. These proteins are characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable them to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. ZNF302 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcription of target genes (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; Gana201219q13.11).

ZNF302 is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell. It is part of the KRAB-ZNF subfamily, which is known for its role in transcriptional regulation during embryonic development and other cellular processes (Gana201219q13.11). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring proper development and differentiation of cells.

In the context of disease, ZNF302 has been implicated in various conditions, such as congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disorders, due to its location in the 19q13.11 region, which is associated with microdeletions linked to intellectual disability and speech disturbances (Jiang2018Genome‐wide; AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF302 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily through its involvement in genetic deletions and potential contributions to congenital and neurodevelopmental disorders. The gene is located within the 19q13.11 region, which is associated with microdeletion syndromes characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, speech disturbances, and microcephaly. These deletions often include ZNF302 along with other zinc finger proteins such as ZNF181, ZNF599, and ZNF30, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of these genes may contribute to the phenotypic manifestations of the 19q13.11 deletion syndrome (Gana201219q13.11).

In the context of congenital heart disease (CHD), ZNF302 has been identified as a candidate gene associated with the condition in the Han Chinese population. A genome-wide study highlighted ZNF302 among other loci with suggestive associations with CHD, indicating its potential role in the genetic predisposition to this disease (Jiang2018Genome‐wide).

While the specific clinical significance of ZNF302 in neurodevelopmental disorders is not fully detailed, its inclusion in the 19q13.11 region, which is linked to conditions like microcephaly and intellectual disability, underscores its potential involvement in these disorders (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Further research is needed to clarify the precise role of ZNF302 in these and other conditions.
