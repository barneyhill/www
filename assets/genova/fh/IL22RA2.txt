# IL22RA2

## Overview
The IL22RA2 gene encodes the interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 2, commonly referred to as IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), which functions as a soluble receptor. This protein plays a critical role in the immune system by acting as a natural antagonist to interleukin 22 (IL-22), a cytokine involved in inflammatory responses. IL-22BP binds IL-22 with high affinity, preventing it from interacting with its membrane-bound receptor, IL-22R, and thereby modulating downstream signaling pathways. This regulation is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. IL-22BP is categorized as a receptor protein and is expressed in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lymphatic organs, where it influences processes such as mucin production and antimicrobial peptide synthesis (Wolk2010Biology; Zenewicz2021IL22). The gene's expression and the protein's function are tightly regulated by environmental signals, highlighting its importance in both health and disease contexts (Zenewicz2021IL22).

## Structure
The IL22RA2 gene encodes the interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), which is a soluble receptor for IL-22. The protein is approximately 24 kDa in size and forms an L-shaped structure with two fibronectin type III domains in tandem, which are common in cytokine receptors (Zenewicz2021IL22). These domains contribute to the protein's ability to bind IL-22 with high affinity, effectively blocking the interaction between IL-22 and its cell surface receptor, IL-22R (Zenewicz2021IL22).

IL-22BP is produced in three isoforms due to alternative splicing: IL-22BPi1, IL-22BPi2, and IL-22BPi3. These isoforms differ in their ability to bind IL-22 and their intracellular processing. IL-22BPi1 is primarily retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and does not bind IL-22, while IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3 are secreted and can neutralize IL-22's biological activity (GómezFernández2018Long). The signal peptide of IL-22BP is crucial for its secretion, and a specific single nucleotide polymorphism, rs28385692, can disrupt this process by altering the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide, leading to reduced secretion of all isoforms (GómezFernández2020The).

## Function
The IL22RA2 gene encodes the interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 2, also known as IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), which functions as a soluble receptor for interleukin 22 (IL-22). IL-22BP acts as a natural antagonist to IL-22 by binding to it with high affinity, thereby preventing IL-22 from interacting with its membrane-bound receptor, IL-22R, and inhibiting downstream signaling pathways. This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation in healthy human cells (Wolk2010Biology; Zenewicz2021IL22).

IL-22BP is primarily produced by immune cells, including dendritic cells, eosinophils, and keratinocytes, and is expressed in various tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lymphatic organs (Lim2014The; Zenewicz2021IL22). Its expression is constitutive, meaning it is consistently produced under normal conditions, and is regulated by environmental signals like retinoic acid and prostaglandin E2 (Zenewicz2021IL22).

The protein's role in cell biology involves modulating IL-22's effects on epithelial tissues, influencing processes like mucin production, antimicrobial peptide synthesis, and lipid absorption. This modulation is essential for maintaining tissue integrity and function, particularly in the skin and gastrointestinal tract (Zenewicz2021IL22).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL22RA2 gene, which encodes the interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 2, have been implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. A rare single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs28385692, in the IL22RA2 gene is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). This variant results in a leucine to proline substitution in the signal peptide, leading to decreased secretion of IL-22 binding protein isoforms, which may contribute to MS pathogenesis by altering immune responses (GómezFernández2020The).

In experimental models, IL22RA2 deficiency has been shown to result in less severe symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role for IL-22BP in neuroinflammation (Laaksonen2014The). Additionally, IL22RA2 is involved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, where IL-22BP is overexpressed, potentially exacerbating disease pathology by inhibiting IL-22's protective effects (Martin2016IL22BP).

Alterations in IL22RA2 expression are also linked to liver and lung conditions, where IL-22BP can exacerbate liver fibrosis and lung infections, respectively (Zenewicz2021IL22). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IL22RA2 in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
The IL22RA2 gene encodes the interleukin 22 binding protein (IL-22BP), which interacts with several proteins and plays a role in modulating immune responses. IL-22BP is known to bind IL-22 with high affinity, preventing its interaction with the membrane-bound IL-22 receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signaling pathways (Zenewicz2021IL22). This interaction is crucial for regulating IL-22 activity, which can have protective or pathogenic roles in inflammation depending on the context (Zenewicz2021IL22).

IL-22BP exists in multiple isoforms, with IL-22BPi2 being particularly effective in binding IL-22 compared to IL-22BPi3, suggesting distinct roles in tissues (Zenewicz2021IL22). The isoforms IL-22BPi1 and IL-22BPi2 interact with the chaperone protein GRP78, a crucial luminal ER chaperone involved in protein folding and transport. This interaction is significant for the secretion of these isoforms, as GRP78 facilitates their proper folding and transit (GómezFernández2018Long). IL-22BPi1 also interacts with other ER chaperones such as GRP94, GRP170, and calnexin, indicating extensive ER quality control (GómezFernández2018Long). These interactions highlight the complex interplay between IL-22BP isoforms and ER chaperones, which is crucial for their secretion and function.
