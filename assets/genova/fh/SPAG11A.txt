# SPAG11A

## Overview
SPAG11A, or sperm-associated antigen 11A, is a gene located on chromosome 8p23 in humans, known for encoding a protein that is part of the beta defensin family. This protein, also referred to as SPAG11A, is characterized by its antimicrobial properties and plays a significant role in the immune defense of the male reproductive tract. The SPAG11A protein is primarily expressed in the epididymis, where it contributes to sperm maturation and motility by binding to spermatozoa and modifying their membranes. It is secreted into the epididymal fluid, providing protection against pathogens and maintaining a conducive environment for sperm development. Additionally, SPAG11A is involved in regulating cell proliferation, potentially acting as a suppressor in epididymal epithelial cells, which may contribute to the low incidence of cancer in this region (Pujianto2013Spermassociated; Sangeeta2019siRNAmediated).

## Structure
The SPAG11A gene encodes a protein that is part of the beta defensin family, characterized by its antimicrobial properties and involvement in host defense. The primary structure of the SPAG11A protein consists of 69 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 7.9 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.03 (Pujianto2013Spermassociated). The protein includes a beta defensin domain located between amino acids 26 and 61, which is crucial for its function in the defense response to bacteria (Pujianto2013Spermassociated).

SPAG11A is a secretory protein, as indicated by the presence of a signal peptide sequence in the first 20 amino acids of the N-terminus, with a cleavage site at the twentieth amino acid, an aspartic acid (D) (Pujianto2013Spermassociated). The protein also contains an N-myristoylation site at amino acids 24-29, which may facilitate its covalent binding to the plasma membrane of sperm (Pujianto2013Spermassociated). Additionally, SPAG11A has potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II, suggesting it can be modified by protein kinases (Pujianto2013Spermassociated). These structural features support its role in sperm maturation and its specific expression in the caput region of the epididymis (Pujianto2013Spermassociated).

## Function
SPAG11A, also known as sperm-associated antigen 11A, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune defense of the male reproductive tract. In humans, SPAG11A is located on chromosome 8p23 and results from the fusion of two ancestral β-defensin genes, producing multiple protein isoforms through alternative splicing (Sangeeta2019siRNAmediated). These isoforms exhibit structural similarities to β-defensins, which are known for their antimicrobial activity (Leir2020An).

The SPAG11A protein is primarily active in the epididymis, where it plays a crucial role in sperm maturation and motility. It is secreted into the epididymal fluid and binds to spermatozoa, suggesting its involvement in modifying sperm cell membranes and facilitating sperm maturation (Pujianto2013Spermassociated). The protein's antimicrobial properties contribute to the protection of sperm from pathogens, thereby maintaining a healthy environment for sperm development (Pujianto2013Spermassociated).

In addition to its role in sperm maturation, SPAG11A is implicated in regulating cell proliferation. Studies have shown that SPAG11A may act as a suppressor of cell proliferation in epididymal epithelial cells, potentially contributing to the low incidence of cancer in the epididymis (Sangeeta2019siRNAmediated).
