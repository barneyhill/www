# HIPK2

## Overview
Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response, and cell cycle control. The protein product of HIPK2, also named homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a kinase domain, interaction domains for homeoproteins, and nuclear localization signals, enabling its function within the nucleus (Kim1999Covalent; Hofmann2000Human). As a kinase, HIPK2 phosphorylates key substrates such as the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby modulating apoptosis and cell proliferation (Cao2019HIPK2; Puca2010Regulation). HIPK2's role extends to antiviral immunity, where it enhances type I interferon production (Cao2019HIPK2). Clinically, HIPK2 is significant in cancer biology, acting as an oncosuppressor, and its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance (D’Orazi2012Updates). The gene's involvement in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target underscore its importance in both health and disease (Valente2015HIPK2).

## Structure
HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure that includes several functional domains. The primary structure of HIPK2 features a kinase domain at the N-terminus, an interaction domain for homeoproteins, a corepressor domain, a PEST motif, and a tyrosine-rich motif in the C-terminal portion (Hofmann2000Human). It also contains three putative nuclear localization signals, which are crucial for its nuclear localization (Kim1999Covalent).

The secondary structure of HIPK2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its folding into a compact, functional enzyme. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable configuration that allows for its enzymatic activity. HIPK2 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Kim1999Covalent).

Post-translational modifications of HIPK2 include phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Phosphorylation, particularly at residues Y354 and S357 in the activation loop, is crucial for its kinase activity and substrate specificity (Saul2013HIPK2). HIPK2 is also modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1, which affects its localization within the nucleus (Kim1999Covalent). Splice variants of HIPK2 may alter its functional domains, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Hofmann2000Human).

## Function
HIPK2 is a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It acts as a transcriptional regulator and corepressor, interacting with homeodomain transcription factors to modulate gene expression. HIPK2 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it phosphorylates p53 at Ser46, facilitating p53-dependent gene expression and apoptosis (Cao2019HIPK2; Puca2010Regulation). It also supports the acetylation of p53, enhancing its apoptotic activity (Puca2010Regulation).

HIPK2 regulates cell proliferation by up-regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, leading to cell cycle arrest, and it phosphorylates the CDK inhibitor p27 kip1 (Schmitz2013Integration). It represses β-catenin-mediated transcription, controlling the expression of cyclin D1, a critical regulator of the G1-S transition in the cell cycle, thereby preventing excessive cell proliferation (Wei2007HIPK2).

In the context of antiviral immunity, HIPK2 enhances the production of type I interferons by interacting with transcription factors such as ELF4, which is essential for the transcription of IFN-β (Cao2019HIPK2). HIPK2's kinase activity and nuclear localization are crucial for its role in these processes (Cao2019HIPK2).

## Clinical Significance
The HIPK2 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In cancer, HIPK2 functions as an oncosuppressor, and its inactivation can lead to tumor progression and chemoresistance. This inactivation may occur through mechanisms such as cytoplasmic localization, protein degradation, and loss of heterozygosity, which result in impaired p53 function and increased tumor growth (D’Orazi2012Updates). HIPK2 is downregulated in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, contributing to the paradoxical co-expression of wild-type p53 with overexpressed Galectin-3 (D’Orazi2012Updates).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, reduced HIPK2 expression correlates with high tumor grade and chromosomal instability, suggesting its role as a caretaker gene in maintaining genomic stability (Valente2015HIPK2). HIPK2 deficiency can lead to cytokinesis failure, resulting in aneuploidy and increased tumorigenicity (Valente2015HIPK2).

HIPK2 is also associated with radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer patients, where the rs2030712 SNP increases the risk of severe radiation-induced lung damage (Tang2020Impact). These findings highlight HIPK2's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
HIPK2 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that engages in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. HIPK2 interacts with the polycomb group protein Pc2, which functions as a SUMO E3 ligase. This interaction is part of a feedback loop where HIPK2 phosphorylates Pc2, affecting its sumoylation and intranuclear localization (Roscic2006PhosphorylationDependent). HIPK2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, phosphorylating it at Ser46, which enhances p53's transcriptional activity and apoptotic function by counteracting the inhibitory effects of MDM2 (Stefano2004HIPK2).

HIPK2 is involved in the degradation process mediated by PARP1 and CHIP. It interacts with the E3 ligase CHIP and the chaperone protein HSP70, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Choi2016PARP1). HIPK2 also phosphorylates the HMGI(Y) protein, which is crucial for its role as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (Pierantoni2001High). Additionally, HIPK2 interacts with mUBC9, a ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme, which is important for its localization to nuclear speckles (Kim1999Covalent). These interactions highlight HIPK2's role in regulating transcription, apoptosis, and protein stability.
