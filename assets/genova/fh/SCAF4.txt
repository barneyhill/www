# SCAF4

## Overview
SCAF4 (SR-related CTD associated factor 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA processing and transcription termination. The SCAF4 protein is characterized by its interaction with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, particularly recognizing doubly phosphorylated Ser2-Ser5 repeats. This interaction is crucial for its role as an mRNA anti-terminator, preventing premature transcription termination and ensuring the production of full-length mRNA transcripts. The protein contains several key domains, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a Ser/Arg-rich domain (SR), which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins. SCAF4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional readthrough at protein-encoding genes. Variants in the SCAF4 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and may influence the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Fliedner2020Variants; Pytte2020Diseasemodifying; Gregersen2019SCAF4).

## Structure
The SCAF4 protein is composed of 1,147 amino acids and includes several key domains that contribute to its function in RNA processing. It features an N-terminal conserved CTD-interacting domain (CID), which is crucial for its interaction with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, playing a significant role in mRNA transcription processes (Fliedner2020Variants). The protein also contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is involved in binding RNA, and a Ser/Arg-rich domain (SR), which facilitates interactions with other proteins and RNA (Fliedner2020Variants). 

SCAF4 is known to interact with the hyper-phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, specifically binding to Ser2-Ser5 biphosphorylated CTD peptides, indicating a preference for certain phosphorylation states (Gregersen2019SCAF4). This binding pattern suggests that SCAF4 is involved in suppressing the use of proximal polyA sites and preventing premature termination of transcription (Gregersen2019SCAF4). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are common in RS domains. 

The SCAF4 gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variants, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function (Fliedner2020Variants).

## Function
SCAF4 (SR-related CTD associated factor 4) is a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. It interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), particularly recognizing the doubly phosphorylated Ser2-Ser5 repeats, which are enriched near splice junctions and within gene bodies (Gregersen2019SCAF4). SCAF4 functions as an mRNA anti-terminator, preventing premature transcription termination by suppressing the use of early alternative polyadenylation (polyA) sites. This ensures the production of full-length mRNA transcripts, which are essential for generating functional protein isoforms (Gregersen2019SCAF4).

SCAF4 is involved in modulating transcriptional readthrough, particularly at protein-encoding genes, without affecting anti-sense transcription or the termination of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) or small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes (Gregersen2019SCAF4). It is active in the nucleus, where it binds to nascent RNA transcripts, often at splice junctions and exons, to regulate polyA site usage and ensure proper mRNA processing (Gregersen2019SCAF4). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining the balance of protein isoforms necessary for cell function and viability (Gregersen2019SCAF4).

## Clinical Significance
Variants in the SCAF4 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mild developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral anomalies. These variants lead to impaired mRNA processing, resulting in transcriptional deregulation and differential expression of thousands of genes. Affected individuals exhibit a range of clinical features, including developmental delays, speech and language delays, seizures, and behavioral anomalies such as autism and aggression. Physical anomalies, including cardiac defects, renal anomalies, and skeletal abnormalities, have also been observed (Fliedner2020Variants).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a structural variant within the SCAF4 gene, specifically the 18T allele, has been linked to increased disease risk and reduced survival time in patients with familial ALS, particularly those with SOD1 mutations. This variant may influence RNA processing and transcription, potentially affecting the expression of nearby genes like SOD1, which is implicated in ALS-related neurodegeneration (Pytte2020Diseasemodifying; Theunissen2022Short).

Overall, alterations in SCAF4, whether through genetic variants or changes in expression, can have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
SCAF4 interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complexes, specifically binding to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII. It shows a preference for CTD repeats that are doubly phosphorylated at Ser2 and Ser5, which are enriched near splice junctions. This interaction is crucial for SCAF4's role in suppressing premature polyadenylation site usage (Gregersen2019SCAF4). SCAF4 also interacts with various phosphorylated forms of RNAPII and is associated with elongating and terminating RNAPII complexes. It does not bind the same RNAPII complex simultaneously with its homolog SCAF8, suggesting a competitive or complementary functional relationship (Gregersen2019SCAF4).

SCAF4 is involved in interactions with several other proteins, including subunits of the PAF complex, the RPRD1-RPAP2 complex, elongation factors like SUPT6H and RECQL5, and other RNAPII-associated proteins such as PHF3. It also interacts with 3' end-processing factors, including members of the CPSF complex, indicating a role in associating with terminating RNAPII (Gregersen2019SCAF4). Additionally, SCAF4 interacts with inhibitory aptamers, such as SCAF4_LS, which can disrupt its interaction with RNAPII, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Li2024BlockerSELEX:).
