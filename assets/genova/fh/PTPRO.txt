# PTPRO

## Overview
PTPRO, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including an extracellular domain with fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular phosphatase domain, classifying it as a transmembrane receptor protein (El2024Analysis). PTPRO plays a significant role in various cellular processes by dephosphorylating specific substrates, thereby regulating signal transduction pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2014Aberrant). It is predominantly expressed in the brain and kidney, where it is involved in neurocognitive functions and glomerular filtration, respectively (Yao2023Agerelated; Xie2021Regulatory). The gene's expression and function are implicated in several diseases, including nephrotic syndrome and various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor (Hendriks2023Hereditable; Dong2016PTPRO).

## Structure
PTPRO is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by a distinct molecular structure. It features an extracellular domain composed of multiple fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular phosphatase domain (El2024Analysis). The number of FN3 domains in human R3 PTPs, which include PTPRO, ranges from 9 to 17, and these domains are modified by N-linked glycosylation, which is a common post-translational modification (El2024Analysis). 

PTPRO exists in different splice variant isoforms, including a truncated form known as PTPROt. This isoform lacks the extracellular domain but retains the transmembrane and intracellular domains, and is expressed in hematopoietic cells. In contrast, the full-length PTPRO is predominantly found in the kidney and brain (El2024Analysis). The extracellular domain of PTPRO is implicated in ligand binding and dimerization, although specific structural details are not fully elucidated (El2024Analysis). 

The structural predictions for similar proteins in the R3 subgroup suggest that these proteins have extended conformations with FN3 domains arranged linearly, although flexibility and disordered regions may exist (El2024Analysis).

## Function
PTPRO (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O) is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which plays a crucial role in regulating multiple signal transduction pathways. It is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, cell-to-cell communication, transcription, and survival (Li2014Aberrant). PTPRO functions by dephosphorylating specific substrates, thereby counteracting the activity of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2014Aberrant).

In the brain, PTPRO is highly expressed in the hippocampus, where it is associated with neurocognitive functions such as synapse development, neuronal differentiation, axonogenesis, and synapse formation (Yao2023Agerelated). It plays a role in maintaining cognitive function and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampal CA3 region (Yao2023Agerelated). PTPRO is also involved in the regulation of the SRC/EPHA4 signaling pathway, which is implicated in cognitive deficiencies and Alzheimer's disease (Yao2023Agerelated).

In the kidney, PTPRO is essential for glomerular filtration and synapse formation, where it regulates glomerular pressure and filtration rate by affecting podocyte structure and function (Yao2023Agerelated; Xie2021Regulatory). Its expression in the kidney does not show age-related changes, highlighting its specific importance in the brain (Yao2023Agerelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PTPRO gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of nephrotic syndrome, mutations in PTPRO are causative of childhood-onset forms of the disease. These mutations lead to podocyte invasion into the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, potentially progressing to end-stage kidney disease (Hendriks2013Protein; Hendriks2023Hereditable).

In cancer, PTPRO acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often reduced in various cancers, including breast cancer, where promoter hypermethylation is a common mechanism of silencing. This epigenetic alteration is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapies like lapatinib in ERBB2-positive breast cancer patients (Dong2022Tyrosine; Dong2016PTPRO). In lung adenocarcinoma, PTPRO downregulation is linked to tumor progression, with its overexpression inducing apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis (Dai2024Protein).

PTPRO is also associated with neurocognitive functions, with certain intronic SNPs linked to learning and memory in schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder patients (Hendriks2013Protein). These findings highlight the gene's diverse roles in disease pathogenesis, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
PTPRO (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In immune cells, PTPRO interacts with Lck and ZAP70, playing a crucial role in T cell receptor signaling by dephosphorylating these proteins, which are essential for T cell activation and proliferation (Xie2021Regulatory). In the context of breast cancer, PTPRO interacts with ERBB2, a protein involved in tumor growth. PTPRO dephosphorylates ERBB2 at the Y1248 residue, leading to its inactivation and promoting endocytotic degradation, which suppresses tumor progression (Dong2016PTPRO).

PTPRO also interacts with neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR) in neurons, where it is involved in axon guidance and neuronal differentiation. This interaction is mediated through the neuronal pentraxin domain of NPR, and PTPRO is necessary for the proper localization of NPR to the plasma membrane (Chen2005A). In macrophages, PTPRO regulates the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, influencing oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, which are critical in the development of atherosclerosis (Liang2017PTPRO). These interactions highlight PTPRO's role in modulating various signaling pathways across different cell types.
