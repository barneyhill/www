# NEDD1

## Overview
NEDD1 is a gene that encodes the NEDD1 gamma-tubulin ring complex targeting factor, a crucial centrosomal protein involved in microtubule organization and spindle assembly during cell division. The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal WD40 repeat region and a less conserved C-terminal region, which facilitates its interaction with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), essential for microtubule nucleation. NEDD1's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, which enhances its interaction with γ-tubulin and promotes γTuRC recruitment to the centrosome. This process is vital for centriole duplication and proper chromosome segregation. NEDD1 is expressed in both normal and tumor-derived cell lines, indicating its fundamental role in cell cycle progression. Alterations in NEDD1 expression have been linked to various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where it serves as a potential biomarker and prognostic factor (Zhou2022Novel; Haren2006NEDD1dependent; Zhang2009Sequential).

## Structure
The NEDD1 protein is characterized by a highly conserved N-terminal WD40 repeat region, which is crucial for its centrosomal localization. This region is composed of multiple WD repeats that form a β-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Haren2006NEDD1dependent; Zhang2009Sequential). The C-terminal region of NEDD1 is less conserved but plays a critical role in interacting with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), essential for microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly (Haren2006NEDD1dependent; Zhang2009Sequential).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are significant for NEDD1's function. During mitosis, NEDD1 is sequentially phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Plk1, which enhances its interaction with γ-tubulin and promotes γTuRC recruitment to the centrosome (Zhang2009Sequential). Specific phosphorylation sites include T382, S397, S426, and S637, which are targeted by Plk1 (Zhang2009Sequential).

NEDD1 also contains a coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus, which is implicated in its structural integrity and function (Haren2006NEDD1dependent). The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its role in microtubule organization and centrosome function.

## Function
NEDD1 is a crucial protein involved in the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) to the centrosome, a key cellular structure for microtubule organization. This recruitment is essential for centriole duplication and spindle assembly during cell division. NEDD1 directly interacts with γ-tubulin, facilitating its localization to the centrosome, which is vital for the formation of a functional mitotic spindle and proper chromosome segregation (Manning2010A; Haren2006NEDD1dependent). 

NEDD1 contains WD40 repeats and interacts with γ-tubulin through its carboxyl-terminus. This interaction is necessary for microtubule nucleation and organization throughout the cell cycle, contributing to processes such as cell polarity, shape, and intracellular transport (Manning2010A). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its interaction with γ-tubulin and other centrosomal proteins (Manning2010A).

In healthy human cells, NEDD1 is expressed at levels comparable to those in tumor-derived cell lines, indicating its fundamental role in normal cell cycle progression. Its depletion leads to defects in microtubule nucleation and spindle formation, resulting in cell cycle arrest due to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (Tillement2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NEDD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NEDD1 expression is significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with poor overall survival in patients. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for HCC, suggesting its potential as a novel biomarker for this type of cancer (Zhou2022Novel). The gene's expression is also linked to immune checkpoint genes such as CTLA-4, PD-L1, and PD-1, indicating its potential role in predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (Zhou2022Novel).

In addition to its role in cancer, NEDD1 is crucial for maintaining centrosome integrity. Depletion of NEDD1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to centrosome abnormalities and premature senescence, highlighting its importance in preventing early cellular aging (Manning2010Aa). Mutations in NEDD1 that disrupt its interaction with γ-tubulin can lead to spindle defects and cell cycle arrest, which may contribute to diseases related to cell cycle dysregulation (Manning2010A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NEDD1 in both cancer and cellular aging processes.

## Interactions
NEDD1 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly by interacting with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). It directly binds to γ-tubulin, a core component of the γTuRC, through a small region at its carboxyl-terminus, which is essential for the correct localization of γ-tubulin to the centrosome (Manning2010A). NEDD1's interaction with γ-tubulin is regulated by sequential phosphorylation by the protein kinases Cdk1 and Plk1. Cdk1 phosphorylates NEDD1 at T550, creating a binding site for Plk1, which further phosphorylates NEDD1 at multiple sites, enhancing its interaction with γ-tubulin and promoting the recruitment of γTuRC to the centrosome (Zhang2009Sequential).

NEDD1 also interacts with Plk1, a mitotic kinase, which is necessary for its recruitment to the centrosome. This interaction is facilitated by the phosphorylation of NEDD1, which is crucial for its function in targeting the γTuRC to the centrosome (Zhang2009Sequential). Additionally, NEDD1 interacts with FAM29A, a spindle-associated protein, which recruits the NEDD1-γ-tubulin complex to the spindle, facilitating microtubule polymerization (Zhu2009FAM29A).
