# DAPP1

## Overview
DAPP1, or dual adaptor of phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides 1, is a gene that encodes a pleckstrin homology domain adaptor protein, commonly referred to as Bam32. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly within the immune system. DAPP1 is characterized by its ability to interact with phosphotyrosine residues and phosphoinositides, facilitated by its Src homology 2 (SH2) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, respectively. These interactions are crucial for its involvement in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, where it contributes to B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. The protein's function is modulated by phosphorylation events, notably at tyrosine 139, which are essential for its recruitment to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways. DAPP1's role extends to various cellular processes, including endocytic vesicle trafficking and immune responses, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Stephens2001Src; Anderson2000DAPP1; AlAlwan2010Bam32DAPP1).

## Structure
The DAPP1 protein, also known as BAM32, is characterized by the presence of two key domains: an amino-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The SH2 domain facilitates interactions with phosphotyrosine proteins, while the PH domain is responsible for binding phosphoinositides, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) (Anderson2000DAPP1). The PH domain of DAPP1 shares structural similarities with the PH domain of TAPP1, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.09 Å on 105 Cα atoms, and a sequence identity of 37% (THOMAS2001Crystal).

The DAPP1 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation at residue Y139, which is crucial for its function and is required for its recruitment to the plasma membrane (Anderson2000DAPP1). This phosphorylation event is significant in the context of PI 3-kinase signaling and is necessary for DAPP1's role in endocytic vesicle trafficking (Anderson2000DAPP1). The protein's modular structure, typical of signaling proteins, suggests a role in cellular signal transduction pathways (Anderson2000DAPP1).

## Function
DAPP1, also known as Bam32, is a pleckstrin homology domain adaptor protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in B cells. It plays a crucial role in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which is essential for B cell activation and immune responses. Upon BCR cross-linking, DAPP1 translocates to the plasma membrane in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner, where it interacts with phosphoinositide products like PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Marshall2007Regulation; Anderson2000DAPP1).

DAPP1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 139, a modification that is critical for its function in BCR signaling. This phosphorylation is mediated by Src family kinases and is necessary for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK and JNK, as well as the GTPase Rac1. These pathways are important for B cell proliferation, adhesion, and spreading, which are vital for effective immune responses and antigen presentation (Stephens2001Src; AlAlwan2010Bam32DAPP1).

In germinal centers, DAPP1 is essential for sustaining responses and facilitating antibody affinity maturation. Its deficiency leads to impaired isotype switching and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in B cell survival and differentiation (Zhang2009The; Niiro2002The).

## Clinical Significance
The DAPP1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In the context of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), DAPP1 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in the brain cortex of individuals with ASD. A novel repeated duplication of the DAPP1 gene has been reported in two separate ASD cases, suggesting a potential association between DAPP1 alterations and ASD (Rahman2020Comprehensive; Sener2014Association).

DAPP1 is also involved in gastrointestinal tract malignancies, where its transcripts, DAPP1-001 and DAPP1-002, are found to be hypomethylated in conditions such as ulcerative colitis, colon adenoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This hypomethylation suggests a role in cancer progression and has been used to construct a prognostic risk-score model for colorectal cancer patients (Triantaphyllopoulos2023Long).

Additionally, genetic variations at the DAPP1 locus have been linked to pollution-related asthma. A genome-wide association study identified a gene-environment interaction between diesel exhaust-elicited airway hyperreactivity and a locus on chromosome 3 encoding DAPP1, indicating that DAPP1 variations may influence susceptibility to asthma triggered by environmental pollutants (Virolainen2022Gene–environment).

## Interactions
DAPP1, also known as Bam32, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It contains an SH2 domain, which allows it to interact with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. This interaction is significant for its phosphorylation, potentially mediated by Src family kinases, as indicated by the inability of a mutant PDGF receptor to stimulate DAPP1 phosphorylation in the absence of Src activation (Anderson2000DAPP1).

DAPP1 is known to associate with phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) upon antigen receptor crosslinking in B cells, suggesting a role in B cell receptor signaling (Anderson2000DAPP1). In mast cells, DAPP1 interacts with proteins like Lyn and SHIP1, which are involved in inhibitory signaling pathways that restrain mast cell activation (Hou2010The). The phosphorylation of DAPP1 by the Src family kinase Lyn is a critical event in these interactions, highlighting its role in modulating calcium responses and mast cell signaling (Hou2010The).

DAPP1 also plays a role in B cell adhesion and spreading, where its phosphorylation on Tyr-139, dependent on PI3K activity and the Src family kinase Lyn, enhances Rac activation and B cell adhesion (AlAlwan2010Bam32DAPP1). These interactions underscore DAPP1's function as an adaptor protein linking phosphoinositide signaling to various cellular processes.
