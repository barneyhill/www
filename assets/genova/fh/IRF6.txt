# IRF6

## Overview
IRF6, or Interferon Regulatory Factor 6, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation and development. The protein product, interferon regulatory factor 6, is characterized by a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a SMIR/IAD protein-binding domain, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation (Li2017Rapid; Kwa2014Receptor-interacting). IRF6 plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis, particularly in keratinocytes, where it regulates the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation (Girousi2021Lack). Mutations in the IRF6 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, including Van der Woude syndrome and Popliteal Pterygium Syndrome, which are characterized by orofacial clefts and other anomalies (Leslie2013Search; Kondo2002Mutations). The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its critical role in craniofacial development and epithelial integrity (WuChou2018Association).

## Structure
The IRF6 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a SMIR/IAD protein-binding domain, both of which are highly conserved across vertebrates (Li2017Rapid). The DNA-binding domain features a modified helix-turn-helix fold with three alpha helices and four antiparallel beta strands, linked by loops that may confer binding specificity (jecrois2021ctbps). The SMIR/IAD domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, crucial for IRF6's regulatory functions (Kwa2014Receptor-interacting).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a critical role in IRF6 activation. Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser-413 and Ser-424, is essential for its activation by receptor-interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4), influencing nuclear translocation and transcription regulation (Kwa2014Receptor-interacting; Zhang2020Functional). The loss of these phosphorylation sites due to mutations can lead to functional impairments (Zhang2020Functional).

IRF6 also has splice variant isoforms, which may differ in function and expression, although specific details on these variants are not extensively covered in the available context (Kwa2014Receptor-interacting).

## Function
IRF6 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and regulating keratinocyte differentiation in human cells. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell morphology, migration, and differentiation potential. In keratinocytes, IRF6 regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation, which is essential for normal epidermal development and the maintenance of skin integrity (Girousi2021Lack).

IRF6 contains a DNA binding domain known as the winged-helix motif, which interacts with specific DNA sequences called Interferon Stimulated Response Elements (ISRE). This interaction suggests that IRF6 may function as a transcription factor, particularly in the context of epidermal tissue development (Bailey2008IRF6). The protein is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle events necessary for differentiation, potentially interacting with pathways involving IKKα and 14-3-3σ (Bailey2008IRF6).

In the absence of IRF6, keratinocytes exhibit disrupted differentiation, leading to impaired formation of the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, resulting in thinner and irregular epidermal layers. This disruption is associated with altered colony morphology and increased cell size, features linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Girousi2021Lack). IRF6 is also implicated in the regulation of immune response proteins, indicating its role in maintaining skin homeostasis and integrity (Girousi2021Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IRF6 gene are primarily associated with Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) and Popliteal Pterygium Syndrome (PPS), both of which are autosomal dominant disorders. VWS is characterized by cleft lip and/or palate and distinctive lower lip pits, making it the most common syndromic form of orofacial clefting, accounting for 1-2% of all cases (Leslie2013Search; Kondo2002Mutations). PPS shares some features with VWS, such as orofacial clefts and lip pits, but also includes additional anomalies like skin folds, genital anomalies, and limb defects (Leslie2013Search).

IRF6 mutations can be classified into truncating and non-truncating categories, with specific mutations linked to particular phenotypes. For instance, mutations in the DNA-binding domain of IRF6 are significantly associated with limb defects (Leslie2013Search). The gene is also implicated in nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCL/P), with several studies confirming its role as a genetic predisposition factor across different populations (WuChou2018Association; Ghassibé2005Interferon).

Alterations in IRF6 expression can disrupt normal orofacial development, leading to these conditions. The gene's role in craniofacial development is further supported by animal model studies, where Irf6 mutant mice exhibit cleft palate due to epidermal hyperproliferation (WuChou2018Association).

## Interactions
IRF6 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is known to interact with Maspin, a serine protease inhibitor and tumor suppressor, and RIPK4, a cytoplasmic kinase that phosphorylates IRF6, promoting its nuclear import and transcriptional activation (ParadaSanchez2017Disrupted). Despite its nuclear role, much of IRF6 remains in the cytoplasm, suggesting additional cytoplasmic functions or sequestration mechanisms (ParadaSanchez2017Disrupted).

IRF6 also interacts with NME1 and NME2, nucleoside diphosphate kinases involved in cellular processes, forming complexes that are crucial for epithelial polarity and stability of junctional complexes. These interactions are enhanced by phosphorylation of specific serine residues in IRF6 by RIPK4, particularly at serine 424, which is essential for binding to the IAD domain of IRF6 (ParadaSanchez2017Disrupted).

In epidermal development, IRF6 interacts with AP2A and TP63, forming a regulatory network that influences gene expression and protein levels. This interaction is critical for maintaining proper cellular organization and proliferation in the epidermis (Kousa2018IRF6). IRF6's interaction with DNA involves binding to the Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE), where it forms dimers to regulate gene expression (Bailey2008IRF6).
