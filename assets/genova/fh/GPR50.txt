# GPR50

## Overview
GPR50 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 50, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, specifically within the melatonin receptor subfamily. Unlike other melatonin receptors, GPR50 does not bind melatonin due to unique structural features, such as differences in its extracellular loops, which influence its functional properties (Clement2017Importance). The receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and mitochondrial quality control, and it plays a role in modulating transcriptional activity through interactions with transcription factors (Liu2024GPR50; Ahmad2020GPR50Ctail). GPR50's interactions with other receptors, such as the TGFβ type I receptor, further underscore its involvement in complex signaling pathways that impact cell proliferation and survival (Wojciech2018The). The gene's mutations and expression levels have been linked to psychiatric, metabolic, and oncological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Wojciech2018The; Liu2024GPR50).

## Structure
GPR50 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the melatonin receptor subfamily. It shares structural features typical of GPCRs, including seven transmembrane helices, which are characteristic of the class A GPCRs (Stauch2019Structural). Despite its sequence similarity to melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, GPR50 does not bind melatonin due to structural differences, particularly in the second extracellular loop (E2 loop) (Clement2017Importance). The E2 loop in GPR50 contains 20 additional atoms compared to MT1, leading to increased steric hindrance and altered folding, which prevents melatonin binding (Clement2017Importance).

The primary structure of GPR50 includes amino acid sequences that are homologous to MT1 and MT2, but with specific differences that affect its function. Notably, a glutamine residue in the E2 loop is replaced by a tyrosine in GPR50, impacting its ability to bind melatonin (Cecon2019Melatonin). GPR50 can form heterodimers with MT1 and MT2, although this interaction inhibits melatonin binding and signaling only in MT1 (Stauch2019Structural). GPR50 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization. Additionally, GPR50 has splice variant isoforms that may affect its structural and functional properties.

## Function
GPR50 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes. In healthy human cells, GPR50 is involved in a unique signal transduction mechanism that diverges from typical GPCR pathways. It undergoes cleavage of its carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which then translocates to the nucleus. This nuclear translocation allows the CTD to interact with transcription factors such as TFII-I, influencing the transcription of genes like c-fos, which are involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Ahmad2020GPR50Ctail).

GPR50 also functions as a mitophagy receptor, crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality and function in neurons. It is recruited to mitochondria under stress conditions, facilitating the degradation of damaged mitochondria and supporting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This process is essential for ATP production and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which is vital for neuronal development and function (Liu2024GPR50).

Additionally, GPR50 interacts with other receptors, such as the TGFβ type I receptor, promoting constitutive activation of TGFβ receptor signaling pathways. This interaction is implicated in cellular processes like cell proliferation and survival, particularly in the context of cancer (Wojciech2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR50 gene have been associated with several psychiatric and metabolic disorders. Variations such as Δ502-505 and T532A are linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, and major depression. These mutations impair GPR50's ability to bind to LC3 and recruit to mitochondria, affecting mitophagy and neuronal development, which may contribute to these conditions (Liu2024GPR50).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, low expression levels of GPR50 are associated with poor survival prognosis. GPR50 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting constitutive TGFβ receptor signaling, and its underexpression is linked to increased tumor growth and decreased survival in certain cancer models (Wojciech2018The).

GPR50 is also implicated in metabolic disorders. Polymorphisms in the gene have been associated with altered lipid metabolism, including higher fasting triglyceride levels and lower HDL-cholesterol levels, suggesting a role in obesity and related metabolic conditions (Bhattacharyya2006Sequence).

Overall, GPR50's involvement in these conditions highlights its significance in both psychiatric and physical health, with its expression and functional interactions playing crucial roles in disease development.

## Interactions
GPR50, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in several notable protein interactions. It interacts with the transcriptional co-activator TIP60, which modulates transcriptional activity of various transcription factors, including nuclear hormone receptors. This interaction involves the translocation of GPR50's cytoplasmic tail into the nucleus, affecting glucocorticoid receptor signaling (Li2011GPR50). GPR50 also forms a complex with the TGFβ receptor type I (TβRI), promoting constitutive signaling through both canonical and non-canonical pathways. This interaction is independent of TGFβ stimulation and involves competition with FKBP12 for binding to TβRI, stabilizing its active conformation (Wojciech2018The).

Additionally, GPR50 interacts with NOGO-A, a neurite outgrowth inhibitor, in synaptic spines, suggesting a role in modulating neurite outgrowth. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies (Grünewald2009GPR50). GPR50's C-terminal domain also interacts with the general transcription factor TFII-I, influencing gene transcription regulation (Ahmad2020GPR50Ctail). These interactions highlight GPR50's involvement in diverse signaling pathways and its potential regulatory roles in cellular processes.
