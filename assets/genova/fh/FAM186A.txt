# FAM186A

## Overview
FAM186A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 186 member A. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM186A has been associated with several health conditions, including cerebrovascular diseases and cancers, suggesting its potential role in disease pathogenesis and progression. The gene's involvement in these conditions is highlighted by its association with specific genetic polymorphisms and mutations that may influence disease risk and development. Despite its emerging significance, further research is needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which FAM186A contributes to these pathological states (Sarathi2018Novel; Yasukochi2018Six; Yao2014Functional).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAM186A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of cerebral infarction (CI), the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6580741 in the FAM186A gene has been identified as significantly associated with a reduced risk of CI in a Japanese population. The CC genotype of this SNP may offer protective effects against CI, suggesting a potential role in cerebrovascular health (Yasukochi2018Six).

FAM186A has also been linked to cancer. It is identified as a stage-II specific differentially expressed gene in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Sarathi2018Novel). In colorectal cancer (CRC), FAM186A polymorphisms have been associated with risk heritability, although its expression was not detected in normal or cancerous colon cells in some studies (Yao2014Functional). Additionally, mutations in FAM186A have been observed in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), though the specific impact of these mutations on the disease remains unclear (Darcy2015The).

Overall, FAM186A appears to play a role in various pathological conditions, particularly in cerebrovascular and cancer-related contexts.
