# CCNJ

## Overview
Cyclin J (CCNJ) is a gene that encodes the cyclin J protein, which is a member of the cyclin family known for their role in regulating the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulatory subunits that activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby controlling the progression of cells through the cell cycle. Cyclin J, in particular, has been implicated in various cellular processes and is associated with the regulation of cell proliferation. The expression and activity of cyclin J are tightly controlled, and dysregulation can contribute to oncogenesis. Research has shown that alterations in CCNJ expression are linked to several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer, where it may influence tumor growth and response to chemotherapy (Feliciano2013miR125b; TAKANO2015CCNJ; Shi2017Upregulation; Sun2015Long).

## Clinical Significance
Cyclin J (CCNJ) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCNJ expression is significantly decreased, primarily due to hypermethylation of its promoter region. This epigenetic modification is prevalent in 78.8% of HCC tissues and correlates with poorer overall survival, suggesting that CCNJ may serve as a prognostic marker in HCC (TAKANO2015CCNJ).

In breast cancer, CCNJ is identified as a target of miR-125b, a tumor suppressor. The downregulation of miR-125b leads to increased CCNJ expression, which is associated with enhanced cell proliferation. Silencing CCNJ in breast cancer cell lines results in decreased proliferation and cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Feliciano2013miR125b).

CCNJ is also involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistance to cisplatin. Knockdown of CCNJ increases the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the drug, suggesting that CCNJ contributes to chemotherapy resistance. This effect is mediated by miR-146a, which targets CCNJ to enhance drug sensitivity (Shi2017Upregulation).

In bladder cancer, CCNJ is a target of miR-205, which acts as a tumor suppressor. High CCNJ expression is linked to tumorigenesis, and its regulation by miR-205 highlights its potential role in cancer progression (Sun2015Long).
