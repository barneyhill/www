# OR10H1

## Overview
OR10H1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily H member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are typically involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. However, OR10H1 has been identified as having significant expression in non-olfactory tissues, particularly in the context of bladder cancer, where it is notably upregulated (Weber2018Characterization). The protein encoded by OR10H1 is implicated in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction, including as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Weber2018Characterization; Tong2021Ectopic).

## Clinical Significance
OR10H1 has been identified as having significant clinical relevance in the context of bladder cancer. The gene is notably upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared to normal bladder tissues, with an average FPKM value of 3.8 in cancerous tissues versus 0.3 in normal tissues, indicating a substantial increase in expression (Weber2018Characterization). This upregulation suggests that OR10H1 could serve as a biomarker for bladder cancer, aiding in diagnosis and potentially in monitoring disease progression (Weber2018Characterization).

The presence of OR10H1 transcripts in the urine of bladder cancer patients further supports its potential use in non-invasive diagnostic procedures (Lee2018Therapeutic). Activation of OR10H1 by the agonist Sandranol has been shown to induce G1 cell cycle arrest, reduce cell migration and proliferation, and increase apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, suggesting a possible therapeutic role for targeting this receptor (Weber2018Characterization; Tong2021Ectopic).

While OR10H1 is primarily associated with bladder cancer, its expression is minimal in most other tissues, except for the prostate, which may also have implications for its role in other urological conditions (Weber2018Characterization). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of OR10H1 expression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
