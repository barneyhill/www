# LDHD

## Overview
LDHD (lactate dehydrogenase D) is a gene that encodes the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase D, which is a member of the oxidoreductase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of D-lactate, catalyzing its conversion to pyruvate, a critical step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle for energy production and cellular respiration (Jin2023Lactate; Kwong2021Human). The LDHD protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an FAD-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain, which confer high stereospecificity for D-isomers over L-isomers (Jin2023Lactate). It is predominantly located in the mitochondria and is expressed in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the liver and heart (Kwong2021Human). Mutations in the LDHD gene are linked to metabolic disorders like D-lactic acidosis and have implications in cancer prognosis, underscoring its clinical significance (Jin2023Lactate; Wang2024Systematic).

## Structure
The LDHD protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It consists of an FAD-binding domain, a substrate-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain. The FAD-binding domain is composed of two subdomains, with the FAD-binding site located at their interface, which is highly conserved among LDHD homologs, indicating its functional importance (Jin2023Lactate). The substrate-binding domain features a seven-strand reverse parallel β-sheet wrapped by six α-helices, forming a channel that connects the substrate-binding site to the solvent, facilitating substrate entry and product exit (Jin2023Lactate).

The active site of LDHD, where the catalytic reaction occurs, is situated at the interface of the FAD-binding and substrate-binding domains. This site includes a positively charged pocket for Mn2+ and glycolate moiety binding, and a hydrophobic pocket for the hydrophobic moiety of the substrate (Jin2023Lactate). The protein's structure allows for high stereo-selectivity for D-isomers over L-isomers, with specific residues such as His398, His405, and Glu442 playing crucial roles in Mn2+ binding and catalysis (Jin2023Lactate). The LDHD protein is an Mn2+-dependent enzyme, and its enzymatic activity is optimal at pH 7.4 (Jin2023Lactate).

## Function
LDHD (lactate dehydrogenase D) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of D-lactate in human cells. It catalyzes the conversion of D-lactate to pyruvate, a key metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is essential for energy production and cellular respiration (Jin2023Lactate; Kwong2021Human). This enzyme is highly stereospecific, acting on D-lactate and other D-2-hydroxyacids, but not on their L-isomers (Jin2023Lactate). LDHD is primarily located in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining metabolic balance and energy homeostasis (Kwong2021Human).

In healthy human cells, LDHD is expressed in tissues with high metabolic rates, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and colon, indicating its role in energy metabolism (Kwong2021Human). The enzyme's activity is dependent on Mn2+ as a cofactor, and it exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity due to its structural features, including a hydrophobic substrate-binding site (Jin2023Lactate). By regulating D-lactate levels, LDHD prevents the accumulation of this metabolite, which can lead to metabolic disturbances such as D-lactic acidosis (Monroe2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LDHD gene are associated with D-lactic acidosis, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of D-lactate, leading to neurotoxic effects and neurological symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, developmental delay, and transient hepatomegaly (Jin2023Lactate; Kwong2021Human). These mutations result in a loss of function of the LDHD enzyme, impairing the conversion of D-lactate to pyruvate and causing elevated levels of D-lactate and other organic acids in urine and plasma (Jin2023Lactate; Monroe2019Identification). 

LDHD mutations have also been linked to mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, which may contribute to the observed neurological manifestations (Kwong2021Human). In addition to metabolic disorders, alterations in LDHD expression levels have been implicated in cancer prognosis. For instance, lower LDHD expression is associated with poor outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Jin2023Lactate; Wang2024Systematic). The gene's involvement in both metabolic and oncological conditions highlights its clinical significance and the need for further research to understand its diverse roles.

## Interactions
LDHD (lactate dehydrogenase D) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. It is regulated by the CDK7-YAP axis, where CDK7 phosphorylates YAP, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which in turn promotes LDHD expression (Lv2023CDK7YAPLDHD). LDHD interacts with the TEAD transcription factor, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and this interaction is further supported by co-immunoprecipitation analysis showing its association with the YAP-TEAD complex (Lv2023CDK7YAPLDHD). 

LDHD is also part of a metabolic axis that includes CDK7 and YAP, which modulates stemness-related properties in ESCC cancer stem cells (CSCs) by promoting D-lactate elimination and ferroptosis defense (Lv2023CDK7YAPLDHD). This axis influences the transition from D-lactate to pyruvate, a process essential for maintaining the self-renewal and proliferative potential of ESCC CSCs (Lv2023CDK7YAPLDHD). The interactions of LDHD with these proteins and its role in metabolic pathways highlight its importance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.
