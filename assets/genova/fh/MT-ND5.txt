# MT-ND5

## Overview
The MT-ND5 gene is a critical component of the mitochondrial genome, encoding the mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 5, a key protein in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is an integral membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the function of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in human cells. As a core subunit, MT-ND5 is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the generation of a mitochondrial membrane potential necessary for ATP synthesis. The proper function of MT-ND5 is crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and is implicated in various mitochondrial disorders when mutated, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Ng2018MTND5; Singh2017Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The MT-ND5 gene encodes a core subunit of Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The primary structure of the MT-ND5 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by mitochondrial DNA. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in electron transfer and proton translocation (Ng2018MTND5).

The secondary structure of MT-ND5 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, allowing the protein to maintain its functional conformation within the mitochondrial membrane. MT-ND5 is located at the periphery of the membrane arm of Complex I and is essential for its activity, although it is not required for the assembly of other ND subunits (Houštěk2012Nonsynonymous).

In terms of quaternary structure, MT-ND5 is one of the multiple subunits that make up Complex I, interacting with other subunits to facilitate enzymatic activity. This complex has an 'L'-shape with two arms: a hydrophobic arm embedded in the lipid membrane and a hydrophilic arm protruding into the matrix (Houštěk2012Nonsynonymous).

## Function
The MT-ND5 gene encodes a core subunit of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in human cells (Ng2018MTND5; Singh2017Mitochondrial). This subunit is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process that contributes to the generation of a mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) used by Complex V to synthesize ATP (McKenzie2016Impaired). 

MT-ND5 is located in the mitochondrial DNA and is part of the guanine-rich heavy chain. It plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular energy metabolism by ensuring efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis (Singh2017Mitochondrial). In healthy cells, MT-ND5 also contributes to calcium signaling by acting as a buffer to regulate intracellular calcium concentrations, which is important for various cellular functions, including neuronal signaling (McKenzie2016Impaired). 

The proper function of MT-ND5 is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, and its activity is essential for the generation of a transmembrane protein gradient that powers ATP synthesis, a critical process for cellular energy production (Ng2018MTND5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-ND5 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome (LS), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). These conditions are characterized by a range of neurological and muscular symptoms due to impaired energy production in cells.

The m.13094T>C mutation in the MT-ND5 gene has been linked to a variety of neurological conditions, including Leigh syndrome and MELAS. This mutation is noted for its highly variable phenotypic expression, even at low mutant loads, which complicates diagnosis and understanding of the disease's natural history (Ng2018MTND5).

Another mutation, m.13513G>A, is associated with an overlap syndrome of LHON and MELAS. This mutation is pathogenic and may be a frequent cause of MELAS, with its presence confirmed in multiple patients exhibiting symptoms of both conditions (Pulkes1999The).

The m.13345G>A mutation in the MT-ND5 gene has been identified in patients with LHON, causing severe bilateral visual loss. This mutation is associated with a mild defect in the combined activity of complex I+III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Engvall2021Case).

## Interactions
MT-ND5 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This complex is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, responsible for the oxidation of NADH and reduction of ubiquinone, coupled with proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane. MT-ND5 interacts with other subunits within complex I to facilitate its assembly and function. The absence of ND5 results in impaired assembly of complex I, leading to a significant loss of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (BOURGES2004Structural).

MT-ND5 is involved in the structural organization of complex I, and its absence affects the association of certain nuclear-encoded subunits with the mitochondrial membrane. Specifically, the 24 kDa subunit shows a unique distribution pattern, being predominantly in the matrix when ND5 is absent, suggesting a role for ND5 in anchoring subunits to the membrane (BOURGES2004Structural).

Prohibitin, a mitochondrial membrane protein, has been identified as an interacting partner with complex I subunits, including MT-ND5. Prohibitin is suggested to act as a chaperone, potentially stabilizing complex I subunits before assembly, which could have implications for complex I assembly and function (BOURGES2004Structural).
