# SPDYE18

## Overview
SPDYE18 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E18, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family known for its involvement in cell cycle regulation through the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). Although SPDYE18 is classified as a pseudogene, it is expressed in the human prefrontal cortex across the lifespan, indicating a potential role in cognitive functions and regulatory processes within this brain region (Wang2018Extensive). The protein encoded by SPDYE18 is implicated in various signaling pathways and has been identified as a prognostic biomarker in several cancer types, underscoring its significance in both normal physiological processes and tumorigenesis (Wang2018Extensive). Despite its pseudogene status, SPDYE18's expression suggests it may participate in essential regulatory functions, possibly through competitive endogenous RNA networks that modulate gene expression and cellular activities (Wang2018Extensive).

## Structure


## Function
SPDYE18 is a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, which is known for its role in regulating the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wang2018Extensive). This gene is part of the Speedy subfamily E, which has undergone significant expansion in humans and is characterized by a novel domain architecture (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE18, although classified as a pseudogene, is expressed in the prefrontal cortex throughout the human lifespan, suggesting it may have a role in fundamental functions within this brain region (Wang2018Extensive).

The expression of SPDYE18 in the prefrontal cortex indicates its potential involvement in cognitive processes, possibly through regulatory networks mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) (Wang2018Extensive). The Speedy family genes, including SPDYE18, are implicated in various signaling pathways and have been identified as prognostic biomarkers in different cancer types, highlighting their importance in both normal physiological processes and tumorigenesis (Wang2018Extensive). The constitutive expression of SPDYE18 in the brain suggests it might participate in essential regulatory functions, possibly through competitive endogenous RNA networks that influence gene expression and cellular functions (Wang2018Extensive).
