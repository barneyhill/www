# CNOT11

## Overview
CNOT11 is a gene that encodes the protein CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 11, which is a part of the CCR4-NOT complex, a key player in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This complex is involved in mRNA deadenylation, a critical process for mRNA decay and translational repression. The protein encoded by CNOT11, although less efficient in promoting mRNA degradation compared to other subunits, contributes to the regulation of gene expression by facilitating mRNA degradation and potentially translational repression (Bawankar2013NOT10). CNOT11 forms a conserved module with CNOT10, which interacts with the N-terminal domain of CNOT1, essential for the recruitment of the catalytic module that promotes mRNA degradation (Bawankar2013NOT10). This interaction is conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary importance in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, development, and response to environmental stimuli (Bawankar2013NOT10).

## Function
CNOT11 is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a multi-subunit protein complex involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In healthy human cells, CNOT11 plays a crucial role in mRNA deadenylation, a process that shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA, leading to mRNA decay and translational repression (Bawankar2013NOT10). CNOT11, along with CNOT10, forms a conserved module that interacts with the N-terminal domain of CNOT1, which is essential for the recruitment of the catalytic module that promotes mRNA degradation (Bawankar2013NOT10).

CNOT11 is less efficient in promoting mRNA degradation compared to other subunits like CAF40, but it still contributes to the regulation of gene expression by facilitating mRNA degradation and possibly translational repression (Bawankar2013NOT10). The interaction between CNOT11 and CNOT10 is crucial for docking onto CNOT1, which is necessary for the full activity of the catalytic module (Bawankar2013NOT10). CNOT11 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, development, and response to environmental stimuli (Bawankar2013NOT10).

## Interactions
CNOT11, also known as CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 11, is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, which plays a crucial role in mRNA regulation. CNOT11 forms a conserved module with CNOT10, and this module docks onto the N-terminal domain of CNOT1, a central scaffold of the complex. This interaction is conserved across species, including humans and Drosophila melanogaster (Bawankar2013NOT10).

The interaction between CNOT11 and CNOT1 is mediated by the DUF2363 domain of CNOT11, which is highly conserved. CNOT10 enhances the binding of CNOT11 to CNOT1, as demonstrated in immunoprecipitation assays conducted in human HEK293 cells (Bawankar2013NOT10). CNOT11 directly interacts with the N-terminal fragments of CNOT1, while CNOT10 does not, indicating that CNOT11 is the subunit responsible for docking the CNOT10-CNOT11 complex onto CNOT1 (Bawankar2013NOT10).

While CNOT11 is involved in promoting the degradation of polyadenylated mRNA targets, it is less efficient in this role compared to other subunits like CAF40. In a tethering assay, CNOT11 was shown to repress the expression of a firefly luciferase reporter by reducing mRNA abundance, although it was inactive in translational repression at the tested concentration (Bawankar2013NOT10).
