# IGDCC3

## Overview
IGDCC3, or immunoglobulin superfamily DCC subclass member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is known for its roles in cell adhesion and signaling. The protein encoded by IGDCC3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell-cell interactions and intracellular signaling pathways. As a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, it is characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its function in mediating cellular communication. The expression and functional dynamics of IGDCC3 have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and musculoskeletal disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Lee2023Identification; Roška2020Differential; Hsu2019Six).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
IGDCC3 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell adhesion and signaling. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), IGDCC3 is significantly associated with relapse-free survival and distal metastasis-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Hsu2019Six). In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), IGDCC3 expression is linked to cisplatin resistance, with down-regulation observed in certain resistant cell lines, indicating its possible involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Roška2020Differential).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), IGDCC3 is associated with the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). The gene's expression and methylation patterns differ between CIMP and non-CIMP phenotypes, suggesting that IGDCC3 could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing these cancer subtypes (Chong2016Distinct). Additionally, IGDCC3 has been identified in genetic studies of Labrador Retrievers, where a SNP within the gene is associated with anterior cruciate ligament rupture, highlighting its potential role in musculoskeletal conditions (Lee2023Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IGDCC3 in various pathological contexts.
