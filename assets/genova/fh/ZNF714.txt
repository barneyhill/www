# ZNF714

## Overview
ZNF714 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 714, a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) family, which is known for its involvement in transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger protein 714 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through indirect mechanisms, possibly involving protein-protein interactions rather than direct DNA binding (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). This protein is associated with the KAP1/SETDB1/NuRD/HP1 complex, which is involved in epigenetic repression, although its specific role within this complex remains to be fully elucidated (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). ZNF714 has been linked to oncogenic processes, particularly in lung cancer, where it is overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and immune evasion (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). The gene's expression is modulated by epigenetic changes such as promoter hypomethylation and copy number variations, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF714 has been implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and potential oncogenic role. It is commonly overexpressed in multiple tumor types, including lung, bladder, breast, cervix, colon, esophagus, liver, stomach, and uterine cancers (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). In lung cancer, ZNF714 is associated with pro-oncogenic features, such as enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing ZNF714 in lung cancer cell lines results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in promoting cancer cell survival (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714).

The gene's expression is linked to immune evasion, as it correlates with immunosuppressive phenotypes and the expression of CD274 (PD-L1) (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). ZNF714 expression is also associated with poorer overall survival in certain cancers, such as pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and mesothelioma, and with disease-free survival in uveal melanoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714).

Alterations in ZNF714 expression are influenced by promoter hypomethylation and copy number variations, which contribute to its overexpression in tumors (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). These findings suggest that ZNF714 plays a significant role in cancer progression and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ZNF714, a member of the KRAB-ZNF family, is primarily localized in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells, suggesting it does not directly interact with nuclear DNA. Despite this, ZNF714 influences gene expression indirectly, as evidenced by RNA-seq analysis showing over 1000 differentially expressed genes upon ZNF714 knockdown (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). The protein's role in gene regulation may involve interactions with other proteins rather than direct DNA binding. ZNF714 is associated with the KAP1/SETDB1/NuRD/HP1 protein complex, which is typically involved in epigenetic repression, although its exact interactions within this complex in the context of lung cancer remain unclear (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714).

ZNF714's oncogenic role might be mediated through interactions with other proteins, such as Nuclear Transcription Factor Y Subunit Beta (NFYB), which could co-regulate neighboring genes (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). The study also suggests potential co-regulation with nearby zinc finger genes, possibly through shared transcription factors like NFYB (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714). However, specific interactions of ZNF714 with proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, indicating a need for further investigation into its molecular interactions (Oleksiewicz2023ZNF714).
