# ADCY4

## Overview
ADCY4 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 4, a member of the adenylate cyclase family of enzymes. These enzymes are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in cellular signaling by catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a key secondary messenger involved in numerous physiological processes. Adenylate cyclase 4 is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is part of Group II adenylyl cyclases, which are activated by G protein subunits but are insensitive to calcium/calmodulin. This protein is implicated in various signaling pathways, including those modulated by protein kinase C. While its specific functions in the central nervous system and other tissues are not fully understood, ADCY4 has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Devasani2022Expression; Guo2022Targeting; Sadana2009Physiological).

## Function
ADCY4 (adenylate cyclase 4) is an enzyme involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a crucial secondary messenger in various signaling pathways. This enzyme is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it influences cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. In the central nervous system (CNS), ADCY4 is expressed in regions such as the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, suggesting a potential role in synaptic plasticity, although its specific functions in these areas remain largely unknown (Devasani2022Expression).

ADCY4 is part of Group II adenylyl cyclases, which are activated by G protein subunits Gαs and Gβγ, but are insensitive to calcium/calmodulin. This group is involved in signaling pathways modulated by protein kinase C, where PKCα specifically inactivates ADCY4 (Devasani2022Expression; Sadana2009Physiological). Despite its expression in various brain regions, ADCY4's role in healthy human cells is not well understood, and it is considered dispensable in certain physiological processes, such as vasopressin-stimulated cAMP generation in kidney collecting duct cells (Kittikulsuth2014Adenylyl; Devasani2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
ADCY4 (adenylate cyclase 4) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression and mutations. In breast cancer, ADCY4 expression is significantly decreased, and its silencing through DNA methylation may terminate its potential tumor inhibitory effects. This suggests that ADCY4 could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for predicting breast cancer prognosis (Guo2022Targeting). 

In Parkinson's disease, variants in ADCY4 have been associated with impulse control disorders (ICDs). A study identified the 'adenylate cyclase activating pathway' as significantly associated with ICDs, with ADCY4 being one of the genes where variants were observed, suggesting a potential role in these disorders (Prud’hon2020Exome).

ADCY4 has also been identified as a candidate gene in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Mutations in ADCY4 were found in ADPKD samples, indicating a possible role in the disease's development through its involvement in the cAMP signaling pathway (Du2021Identification).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ADCY4 in various conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.

## Interactions
ADCY4 (adenylate cyclase 4) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. In the context of solanine-induced ferroptosis in colorectal cancer cells, ADCY4 physically interacts with ALOX12B. This interaction is essential for the stability of the ALOX12B protein, which is upregulated during solanine treatment. The interaction between ADCY4 and ALOX12B is necessary for maintaining ALOX12B protein stability, which is important for the ferroptosis process in colorectal cancer cells (Ma2024Solanine). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis has shown that solanine-induced overexpression of ALOX12B results in more ADCY4 being precipitated, indicating a direct physical interaction between these two proteins (Ma2024Solanine).

ADCY4 is also a member of the adenylate cyclase family, which catalyzes the production of cAMP, a secondary messenger. While its role in ferroptosis is novel, ADCY4's dysregulation has been linked to various malignancies (Ma2024Solanine). The requirement of adenylate cyclase enzyme activity for the interaction between ADCY4 and ALOX12B in the context of ferroptosis remains to be further investigated (Ma2024Solanine).
