# LCMT1

## Overview
Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1, which is a member of the class I S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by methylating its C-terminal leucine residue, a modification essential for the proper assembly and function of PP2A holoenzymes. These holoenzymes are critical regulators of various cellular processes, including cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication, and signal transduction (Tsai2010The; Stanevich2011The). LCMT1's activity is crucial for the formation of PP2A heterotrimers, particularly those containing the Bα regulatory subunit, which are important for cell survival and normal mitotic progression (Lee2007Leucine). The enzyme's function extends to the regulation of other protein phosphatases, such as PP4 and PP6, influencing their stability and function in cellular signaling (Lyons2021Regulation). LCMT1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Lee2007Leucine).

## Structure
The human leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) is a member of the class I AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase family and is part of the FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form a seven-stranded beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices. The core beta-strands are arranged in the order: 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 6, with strands 1-5 and 6 being parallel, while strand 7 is antiparallel (Tsai2010The).

The tertiary structure of LCMT1 is characterized by several insertions that are crucial for substrate recognition and specificity. These insertions are grouped into three regions: the 3-2 region, the 1-4-5 region, and the 7-6 region. These structural elements create a stabilizing hydrophobic environment and provide a platform for specific interactions with the substrate, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Tsai2010The). The crystal structure of LCMT1 was solved using the molecular-replacement method, revealing that the AdoMet molecule is not fully buried, suggesting an entry site for the PP2A catalytic subunit's carboxyl-terminal motif (Tsai2010The).

LCMT1's activity is dependent on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (Tsai2010The). The enzyme's structure includes a methyltransferase domain, and it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Splice variant isoforms of LCMT1 may exist, potentially altering its structure and function.

## Function
Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of the C-terminal leucine residue of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key regulator of various cellular processes. This methylation is essential for the proper assembly and function of PP2A holoenzymes, which are involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication, mRNA translation, signal transduction, and apoptosis (Tsai2010The; Stanevich2011The). LCMT1's activity is critical for the formation of PP2A heterotrimers, particularly those containing the Bα regulatory subunit, which are important for cell survival and normal mitotic progression (Lee2007Leucine).

LCMT1 is also involved in regulating the methylation-dependent assembly of other protein phosphatases, such as PP4 and PP6, affecting their stability and function in cellular signaling and dephosphorylation processes (Lyons2021Regulation). The enzyme's activity is dependent on the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine and can be inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine, which impacts PP2A methylation and function (Tsai2010The). LCMT1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Lee2007Leucine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCMT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the loss of LCMT1 is associated with increased androgen receptor (AR) activity and tumor growth. This is due to decreased methylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit, which affects the assembly of PP2A holoenzymes that regulate AR signaling. The degradation of LCMT1, mediated by the AKT/S6K1 pathway, contributes to therapy resistance in prostate cancer, suggesting that LCMT1 loss is a significant factor in the progression and treatment resistance of this disease (Rasool2023Loss).

In the context of insulin signaling, reduced expression of LCMT1 in a hypomorphic mouse model led to decreased methylation of PP2A and resulted in insulin resistance. This indicates a potential link between LCMT1 expression and insulin signaling pathways, suggesting that alterations in LCMT1 could contribute to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance (MacKay2013Circumventing).

LCMT1 is also crucial for fetal liver hematopoiesis, with its loss leading to severe defects in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and function. This is potentially due to enhanced NF-B signaling, indicating that LCMT1 defects could contribute to hematopoietic disorders (Lee2018Global).

## Interactions
LCMT1 (leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1) is primarily involved in the methylation of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical enzyme in cellular signaling. LCMT1 interacts directly with the PP2A active site, facilitating the methylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit, which is essential for the assembly of functional PP2A holoenzymes and the regulation of phosphatase activity (Stanevich2011The). This interaction is crucial for converting activated PP2A into substrate-specific holoenzymes, thereby preventing uncontrolled phosphatase activity (Stanevich2011The).

LCMT1 also interacts with other protein phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) and protein phosphatase 6 (PP6). It differentially regulates the formation of PP4 holoenzymes, with its methylation activity being essential for the stability of certain PP4 complexes (Hwang2016Leucine). The loss of LCMT1 results in the formation of novel complexes and affects the assembly of PP4 and PP6 holoenzymes, indicating its broader role in phosphatase regulation (Hwang2016Leucine).

In the context of cancer, LCMT1's interaction with PP2A is significant for regulating oncogenic pathways. The loss of LCMT1 leads to decreased PP2A-C methylation, affecting the formation of PP2A heterotrimers and contributing to therapy resistance in prostate cancer (Rasool2023Loss).
