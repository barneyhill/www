# RBMX

## Overview
The RBMX gene encodes the RNA binding motif protein X-linked, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing, genome stability, and chromosome segregation. As a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, RBMX is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and RGG/RG motifs, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins (Elliott2019RBMX; Cho2018RBMX). The protein is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly of ultra-long exons, and is essential for maintaining genomic integrity by activating the ATR pathway in response to replication stress (Zheng2020RBMX; Luzzi2020RBMX). Additionally, RBMX contributes to telomere stability and chromatid cohesion, underscoring its importance in cell division and chromosomal maintenance (Cho2018RBMX; Liu2023RBMX). Alterations in RBMX expression or function are implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yan2021RBMX; Cai2021Deletion).

## Structure
The RBMX protein, encoded by the RBMX gene, is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. It contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) that facilitates RNA binding, which is crucial for its role in splicing regulation and other RNA processing activities (Elliott2019RBMX; Cho2018RBMX). The protein also features several RGG/RG motifs, which are subject to arginine methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), particularly PRMT5. This post-translational modification affects the protein's stability, localization, and RNA binding affinity (Cai2021Deletion).

The RBMX protein is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as SRSF1 and Sam68, to regulate alternative splicing. The RGG/RG motif is essential for these interactions, and its deletion can lead to defects in neuronal differentiation and aberrant activation of the p53 pathway (Cai2021Deletion). RBMX also interacts with satellite I RNA during the M phase, playing a role in centromere cohesion and chromosome segregation (Cho2018RBMX).

RBMX has several splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Elliott2019RBMX).

## Function
The RBMX gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability in healthy human cells. It is involved in the activation of the ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) pathway, which is essential for responding to replication stress, particularly on repetitive DNA sequences. RBMX binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and facilitates the positioning of TopBP1, a major activator of ATR, thereby promoting ATR activation and ensuring genomic integrity (Zheng2020RBMX).

RBMX is also implicated in RNA processing, particularly in the splicing of ultra-long exons, which are important for genome stability. It regulates splicing events that are critical for the proper expression of genes involved in DNA replication and repair (Luzzi2020RBMX). Additionally, RBMX is involved in the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with the cohesin complex and other proteins to maintain proper chromatid cohesion, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division (Cho2018RBMX).

RBMX also plays a role in telomere stability by regulating the expression and stability of TERRA, a long non-coding RNA involved in telomere structure, which is crucial for maintaining telomere integrity (Liu2023RBMX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBMX gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In Shashi-XLID syndrome, a deletion of 23 base pairs in the RBMX gene results in the loss of the RGG/RG motif, leading to a frameshift and premature termination codon. This mutation causes aberrant activation of the p53 pathway, increased apoptosis, and defects in neuronal differentiation, particularly affecting the maturation of glutamatergic neurons. The loss of the RGG/RG motif disrupts the regulation of MDM4 alternative splicing, which is crucial for normal neuronal development and function (Cai2021Deletion).

In bladder cancer, RBMX acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with hnRNP A1 to regulate PKM alternative splicing. Low levels of RBMX expression are linked to poor survival outcomes, increased tumor growth, and metastasis. RBMX inhibits the oncogenic effects of hnRNP A1, promoting the formation of the PKM1 isoform over the PKM2 isoform, which is associated with less aggressive cancer phenotypes (Yan2021RBMX).

In myeloid leukemia, RBMX and its retrogene RBMXL1 are overexpressed and play a role in maintaining chromatin state and leukemia cell survival. They regulate the expression of CBX5, a component of heterochromatin, which is crucial for chromatin compaction and integrity (Prieto2021Transcriptional).

## Interactions
RBMX, also known as RNA binding motif protein X-linked, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the hnRNP A1 protein, a key regulator of PKM pre-mRNA alternative splicing in cancer. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting PKM2 isoform formation and promoting PKM1 isoform formation, suggesting antagonistic effects between RBMX and hnRNP A1 (Yan2021RBMX). RBMX also forms a complex with SRSF1 to regulate alternative splicing, with the interaction being a direct protein-protein interaction (Cai2021Deletion).

RBMX is a component of the centromere noncoding RNP complex, interacting with satellite I RNA during the M phase, which is essential for centromere cohesion and chromosome segregation (Cho2018RBMX). It also interacts with SAFB1, enhancing the Srebp-1c promoter activity, which is crucial for lipogenic enzyme regulation in the liver (Omura2009SAFB1). In the context of chromatin compaction, RBMX binds to CBX5 transcripts, affecting mRNA levels and maintaining chromatin structure (Prieto2021Transcriptional). These interactions highlight RBMX's multifaceted role in gene regulation and cellular stability.
