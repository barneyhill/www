# LCE1B

## Overview
LCE1B (late cornified envelope 1B) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, which is integral to the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis. This protein plays a pivotal role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, contributing to the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin. As a member of the LCE family, LCE1B is involved in the keratinization process, essential for maintaining skin hydration and protecting against environmental insults. The protein encoded by LCE1B interacts with other structural proteins, such as involucrin and loricrin, to form a resilient barrier that prevents dehydration and pathogen entry. The expression of LCE1B is regulated by transcription factors like TAp63, which activate terminal differentiation genes in the epidermis, although it operates independently of Notch signaling pathways (Koh2015Transcriptional; Kim2016Transcriptome; Zhang2021Bioinformatics).

## Function
LCE1B (late cornified envelope 1B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin's protective barrier. This protein is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, which plays a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. The LCE proteins, including LCE1B, contribute to the structural integrity and function of the skin barrier by participating in the keratinization process, which is essential for maintaining skin hydration and protecting against environmental insults (Kim2016Transcriptome; Zhang2021Bioinformatics).

In healthy human cells, LCE1B is expressed during the late stages of keratinocyte differentiation, contributing to the formation of the cornified envelope. This process involves the cross-linking of structural proteins to form a resilient barrier that prevents dehydration and pathogen entry (Koh2015Transcriptional). The expression of LCE1B is regulated by transcription factors such as TAp63, which are involved in the activation of terminal differentiation genes in the epidermis (Koh2015Transcriptional). Despite its critical role in skin barrier function, LCE1B expression is independent of Notch signaling, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism in keratinocyte differentiation (Koh2015Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
The LCE1B gene is implicated in several skin conditions due to its role in the formation of the cornified envelope, which is crucial for skin barrier function. In dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), LCE1B is strongly overexpressed, potentially as a compensatory mechanism in response to reduced loricrin expression, which is a key component of the cornified envelope (Breitenbach2015Transcriptome). This overexpression is also observed in skin aging, suggesting a shared pathway in these conditions.

In psoriasis, polymorphisms in the LCE1B gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to the disease. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the LCE gene cluster, including LCE1B, that are linked to psoriasis vulgaris, particularly among Mongolian populations (Sun2018Association). The LCE1B gene is part of a cluster that shows significant genetic associations with psoriasis, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Liu2008A).

Additionally, LCE1B has been identified as one of the top hub genes in oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic autoimmune condition affecting the oral mucosa, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhang2021Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
LCE1B (late cornified envelope 1B) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis, contributing to the skin's barrier function. It is part of the LCE gene cluster, which is involved in skin differentiation and barrier formation. LCE1B is known to interact with other proteins that are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the skin. Notably, it may interact with involucrin and loricrin, which are key components of the cornified envelope. These interactions are significant as they help in the assembly and stabilization of the protein network that forms the outermost layer of the skin, providing a robust barrier against environmental insults. The precise nature of these interactions, whether they are direct or part of a larger multiprotein complex, is crucial for understanding the functional dynamics of the skin barrier. The involvement of LCE1B in these interactions underscores its importance in skin health and its potential role in skin-related disorders.
