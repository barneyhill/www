# USP20

## Overview
USP20, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 20, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and cellular homeostasis. The protein product of USP20 is characterized by its ability to remove ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their degradation and functional pathways. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP20 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein localization, and the DNA damage response. It is particularly significant in the regulation of β-adrenergic receptors and inflammatory signaling pathways, impacting cardiac function and immune responses. USP20's interactions with proteins such as Rad17, β-catenin, and Claspin underscore its involvement in DNA repair, Wnt signaling, and ATR-dependent signaling pathways, respectively. Clinically, alterations in USP20 expression have been linked to several cancers, where it may act as both a tumor promoter and suppressor, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yuan2014HERC2USP20; Jin2023USP20; JeanCharles2016Ubiquitinspecific).

## Structure
USP20, also known as VDU2, is a deubiquitinating enzyme composed of 914 amino acids with a molecular weight of 102 kDa. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal zinc finger ubiquitin-specific protease (ZnF-UBP) domain, a USP catalytic domain, and two tandem domains present in ubiquitin-specific proteases (DUSP) domains (Li2022The; Hu2021Expression). The ZnF-UBP domain is known to bind with K48-linked di-ubiquitin, although its full function is not completely understood (Li2022The). The USP catalytic domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, featuring strong homology around the catalytic Cys box and His box, which are typical of cysteine proteases (Li2022The; Daviet2008Targeting).

The tertiary structure of USP20 resembles a right hand, with 'palm', 'finger', and 'thumb' domains forming a ubiquitin-binding surface. The catalytic center is located between the 'palm' and 'thumb', facilitating the removal of ubiquitin molecules from proteins (Li2022The). The DUSP domains, particularly DUSP2, have been characterized to form an AB3 fold in solution, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions or substrate recognition (Hu2021Expression).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for USP20's activity. Phosphorylation at serine 333 by protein kinase A is essential for its deubiquitinase activity, while phosphorylation at serines 132 and 134 by mTORC1 increases the stability of HMG-CoA reductase (Li2022The).

## Function
USP20 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 20) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability and cellular homeostasis by removing ubiquitin from target proteins. In healthy human cells, USP20 is involved in the post-endocytic trafficking of β2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) during physiological stress. It is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine 333, which inhibits its deubiquitinase activity, leading to the trafficking of ubiquitinated β2ARs to autophagosomes for degradation (Kommaddi2015Phosphorylation).

USP20 also regulates β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) expression and signaling in myocardial cells. It deubiquitinates β1AR, preventing its lysosomal degradation and maintaining receptor signaling pathways crucial for cardiac function (Yu2019The). Additionally, USP20 modulates inflammatory signaling by deubiquitinating TRAF6, which is involved in NFκB activation. This activity is essential for its anti-inflammatory role, as demonstrated in smooth muscle cells where USP20 reduces TRAF6 ubiquitination and downstream NFκB signaling (JeanCharles2016Ubiquitinspecific).

USP20 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein localization, thereby impacting organismal outcomes such as cardiac function and inflammatory responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in USP20 expression have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal, breast, cervical, and gastric cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high USP20 expression is associated with poor prognosis, lymph node metastasis, and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, indicating its potential as a predictor of chemotherapy resistance (Jin2023USP20). USP20 promotes metastasis in CRC cells by enhancing migration and invasion, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a role in tumor immunity regulation (Jin2023USP20).

In breast cancer, USP20 stabilizes ERK3 and SNAI2, promoting cell migration and invasion, particularly in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, and correlates with poor prognosis (Li2022The). In cervical cancer, USP20 stabilizes p62, promoting cell survival through NF-κB activation, while in gastric cancer, low USP20 expression correlates with poor prognosis and affects cell cycle progression through Claspin stability (Li2022The; Wang2017Deubiquitinating).

USP20 also plays a role in the DNA damage response pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor. Its depletion can lead to increased tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of c-Myc overexpression (Yuan2014HERC2USP20). These findings suggest that USP20's expression and interactions are clinically significant and could serve as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
USP20 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 20) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It interacts with Rad17, a protein involved in DNA repair, stabilizing it by deubiquitylation and preventing its degradation by the proteasome. This interaction is enhanced by UV exposure and is crucial for maintaining Rad17 stability and function in the DNA damage response (Shanmugam2014Ubiquitinspecific).

USP20 also interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. It stabilizes β-catenin by preventing its proteasomal degradation, which is significant for tissue homeostasis and cancer progression (Wu2018USP20). In the context of inflammation, USP20 associates with RIPK1, a protein involved in TNF-triggered NFκB activation, and deubiquitinates it, thereby modulating inflammation pathways (JeanCharles2018USP20).

USP20 is involved in the DNA damage response through its interaction with Claspin, a mediator in ATR signaling. This interaction is essential for the upregulation of Claspin following DNA damage, highlighting USP20's role in the ATR-dependent signaling pathway (Yuan2014HERC2USP20). Additionally, USP20 interacts with MITA, a key protein in antiviral signaling, stabilizing it by deconjugating K48-linked ubiquitination, which is crucial for the antiviral response (Zhang2019USP20).
