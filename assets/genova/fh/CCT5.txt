# CCT5

## Overview
CCT5 is a gene that encodes the protein chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 5, which is a critical component of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is a type of molecular chaperone involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Grantham2020The; Scalia2023Structural). The CCT5 protein is categorized as a chaperonin, a class of proteins that assist in the proper folding of other proteins. It plays a significant role in cellular processes such as autophagy, protein homeostasis, and the regulation of actin dynamics (Pavel2016CCT; Feng2022ChaperoninContaining). Mutations in the CCT5 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Ahmed2024The; Bouhouche2005Mutation).

## Structure
The CCT5 protein, a subunit of the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex, is composed of 541 amino acids and is organized into three distinct domains: equatorial, intermediate, and apical. The equatorial domain, which includes the nucleotide-binding site, is formed by the N-terminal (residues 1-154) and C-terminal (residues 418-541) regions. This domain contains nucleotide-binding loops that interact with ADP's phosphate groups (Pereira2017Structure; Scalia2023Structural). The intermediate domain connects the equatorial and apical domains and includes α-helices and β-sheets, acting as a hinge for conformational changes (Pereira2017Structure; Scalia2023Structural). The apical domain, involved in substrate binding, features an extended α-helix that acts as a lid to close the folding chamber (Pereira2017Structure; Scalia2023Structural).

CCT5 forms part of a double-ring hexadecamer structure, similar to group II chaperonins, with two rings of subunits stacked back-to-back (Min2014A). The His147Arg mutation in the equatorial domain affects ATP binding and the formation of the double-ring structure, impacting the protein's chaperoning functions (Min2014A; Scalia2023Structural).

## Function
The CCT5 gene encodes a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, also known as the TRiC complex, which is crucial for protein folding in human cells. This complex is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are essential for cellular structure and function (Grantham2020The; Scalia2023Structural). CCT5, as part of the CCT complex, plays a significant role in autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components. It helps restrict protein aggregation by facilitating the autophagic clearance of misfolded or aggregated proteins, thus maintaining cellular health (Pavel2016CCT).

In addition to its role in protein folding, CCT5 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics. It interacts with filamentous actin (F-actin) and influences cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis through pathways like the LIMK1/cofilin pathway (Feng2022ChaperoninContaining). CCT5 also contributes to the structural integrity and function of the CCT complex, with its monomers forming homo-oligomeric complexes critical for the assembly of the full hetero-oligomeric CCT complex (Scalia2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCT5 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and neuropathic conditions. A notable mutation, A492G, results in the substitution of histidine with arginine at position 147 (H147R) in the CCT5 protein. This mutation is linked to autosomal recessive mutilating sensory neuropathy with spastic paraplegia, characterized by progressive distal sensory neuropathy, severe infections, osteomyelitis, amputations, and mild paraplegia due to bilateral upper motor neuron involvement (Bouhouche2005Mutation; Pereira2017Structure). The mutation is hypothesized to reduce the protein-folding activity of TRiC complexes containing the CCT5-H147R subunit, potentially affecting substrates like tubulin and actin, which are crucial for neuronal function (Pereira2017Structure).

Alterations in CCT5 expression levels have been implicated in cancer. CCT5 is highly expressed in various tumors and is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene. It is linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (Ahmed2024The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, CCT5 overexpression promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes (Liu2021Exploring).

## Interactions
CCT5, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT or TRiC), is involved in various protein interactions essential for cellular processes. It interacts with cyclin D1 (CCND1) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, promoting cell migration and invasion by influencing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signals (Meng2021CCT5). CCT5 also plays a role in the assembly of the mTOR complex by interacting with mLST8 and Raptor, which are components of mTORC1 and mTORC2. These interactions are crucial for the proper folding and stability of the mTOR complex components (Cuéllar2019Structural).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, CCT5 is involved in modulating protein aggregation. It interacts with proteins like huntingtin and α-synuclein, preventing their aggregation, which is significant in conditions such as Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases (Grantham2020The). CCT5 also influences autophagy pathways, impacting the degradation of aggregate-prone proteins, and its depletion leads to increased protein aggregation in autophagy-competent cells (Pavel2016CCT).
