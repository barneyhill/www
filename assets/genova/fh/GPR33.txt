# GPR33

## Overview
GPR33 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 33, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in cellular signal transduction by responding to various extracellular stimuli and activating intracellular signaling pathways. The GPR33 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its function as a receptor. Although the specific ligands and physiological roles of GPR33 remain largely unexplored, it is hypothesized to be involved in immune response and inflammation due to its expression patterns in certain tissues. The gene has been subject to evolutionary studies, revealing that it is a pseudogene in some species, including humans, suggesting a potential loss of function during evolution (Qiu2020aarFDC).
