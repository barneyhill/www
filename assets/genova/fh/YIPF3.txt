# YIPF3

## Overview
YIPF3 is a gene that encodes the protein Yip1 domain family member 3, a multi-span transmembrane protein primarily localized in the cis-Golgi apparatus. This protein is integral to the process of Golgiphagy, a selective autophagy mechanism responsible for the turnover and maintenance of the Golgi apparatus. Yip1 domain family member 3 forms a complex with YIPF4, acting as a Golgiphagy receptor, which is essential for maintaining Golgi homeostasis and cellular function. The protein's interaction with ATG8 family proteins, facilitated by its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, underscores its role in autophagic processes. The stability and function of Yip1 domain family member 3 are closely linked to its association with YIPF4, highlighting the importance of this complex in cellular homeostasis and the degradation of damaged organelles (Kitta2023Golgi; Tanimoto2011Characterization).

## Structure
YIPF3 is a multi-span transmembrane protein characterized by five transmembrane regions, with an N-terminal cytoplasmic region and a C-terminal luminal region (Shaik2019Characteristics; Tanimoto2011Characterization). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation, which occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, respectively (Tanimoto2011Characterization). The N-glycosylation site is identified as asparagine 337, while the O-glycosylation sites include threonine residues at positions 333, 334, 339, and 346 (Tanimoto2011Characterization).

YIPF3 forms a complex with YIPF4, which is crucial for its localization and function in the Golgi apparatus (Tanimoto2011Characterization). This complex formation is important for maintaining Golgi structure and is involved in processes such as Golgiphagy, where YIPF3 interacts with ATG8 family proteins through its LIR motif (Kitta2023Golgi). The stability of YIPF3 is dependent on its association with YIPF4, as the deletion of YIPF4 results in the loss of YIPF3 (Hickey2022Quantitative).

## Function
YIPF3 is a Golgi membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the turnover of the Golgi apparatus through a selective autophagy process known as Golgiphagy. This protein forms a complex with YIPF4, acting as a Golgiphagy receptor, which is essential for maintaining Golgi apparatus homeostasis in healthy human cells (Kitta2023Golgi). YIPF3 interacts with ATG8 family proteins, such as LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1, through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is crucial for its function as an autophagy receptor (Kitta2023Golgi). Phosphorylation of serine residues near the LIR motif enhances this interaction, facilitating the autophagic process (Kitta2023Golgi).

YIPF3 is primarily localized in the cis-Golgi and is involved in the autophagic degradation of Golgi components, particularly during nutrient stress (Tanimoto2011Characterization; Hickey2022Quantitative). The YIPF3-YIPF4 complex is specific to Golgiphagy and does not participate in nonselective bulk autophagy or ER-phagy, highlighting its specialized role in cellular homeostasis (Kitta2023Golgi). This process is vital for the degradation of damaged organelles and the maintenance of cellular function (Kitta2023Golgi).

## Interactions
YIPF3 interacts with YIPF4 to form a complex that is crucial for maintaining Golgi structure and function. This complex is specific, as YIPF3 and YIPF4 form distinct complexes from their paralogues YIF1A and YIPF5 (Tanimoto2011Characterization). The stability of YIPF3 is dependent on its interaction with YIPF4, as knockdown experiments in HeLa cells showed that reducing YIPF4 levels also reduced YIPF3 levels (Tanimoto2011Characterization). YIPF3 and YIPF4 are involved in the autophagic turnover of the Golgi apparatus, acting as Golgiphagy receptors. YIPF3 interacts with ATG8 family proteins, such as LC3B, GABARAP, and GABARAPL1, through its LIR motif, which is regulated by phosphorylation (Kitta2023Golgi). This interaction is essential for the selective degradation of the Golgi via autophagy (Kitta2023Golgi). YIPF3 does not interact with ATG8 proteins in the absence of YIPF4, highlighting the necessity of the YIPF3-YIPF4 complex for these interactions (Kitta2023Golgi). The YIPF3-YIPF4 complex is also involved in the formation of higher-order oligomers, with YIPF3 forming part of a tetramer with YIPF4 (Shaik2019Characteristics).
