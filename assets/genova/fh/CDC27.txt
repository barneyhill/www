# CDC27

## Overview
CDC27 is a gene that encodes the cell division cycle 27 protein, a crucial component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in regulating the cell cycle. The CDC27 protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function within the APC/C. This protein plays a pivotal role in the transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis by targeting specific proteins, such as cyclin B, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Zhang2010Molecular; King1995A). CDC27's interactions with other APC/C subunits and mitotic checkpoint proteins underscore its importance in maintaining the fidelity of cell division (Lamb1994Cdc16p; Lee2016Identification). Additionally, CDC27 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance beyond cell cycle regulation (Wu2020&lt).

## Structure
The CDC27 protein is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of CDC27 includes multiple TPR motifs, with the N-terminal domain forming a homo-dimeric structure predominantly composed of these motifs (Zhang2010Molecular). The secondary structure is defined by 14 α-helices that form a TPR-like fold, creating a superhelical arrangement (Zhang2010Molecular).

The tertiary structure of CDC27 involves a continuous TPR superhelix, with the N-terminal domain forming a V-shaped molecule through its dimerization (Barford2010Structure). The quaternary structure is characterized by the homo-dimerization of the N-terminal domain, which is crucial for the protein's stability and function within the APC/C (Zhang2010Molecular). The dimer interface is dominated by non-polar interactions, primarily involving phenylalanine and tyrosine residues (Zhang2010Molecular).

CDC27 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which play a role in its regulation during the cell cycle (Zhang2011Phosphorylation). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in cell cycle regulation and the function of the APC/C.

## Function
CDC27 is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a large E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the cell cycle by targeting specific proteins for degradation. This process is essential for the transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis. CDC27, along with other subunits like CDC16 and CDC23, forms a complex that facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of cyclin B, a key regulator of mitosis (King1995A). The degradation of cyclin B is mediated by the attachment of polyubiquitin chains, marking it for destruction by the proteasome, which is crucial for the exit from mitosis and the progression through anaphase (King1995A).

CDC27 is also involved in the regulation of Cdc20 proteolysis, which is necessary for proper cell cycle progression. The instability of Cdc20 throughout the cell cycle is partly dependent on CDC27, highlighting its role in APC-dependent proteolysis (Prinz1998The). CDC27 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability and ensuring the fidelity of cell division (Schwickart2004Swm1Apc13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDC27 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In gastric cancer, CDC27 mutations are associated with peritoneal metastasis, leading to a higher risk of postoperative metastasis and reduced overall and disease-free survival. These mutations are more prevalent in certain populations compared to data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Comprehensive; p&gt; Wu2020&lt). 

CDC27 is also linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where its expression is lower in patients compared to healthy controls. This reduced expression correlates with disease activity indicators, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for SLE (Shang2022A).

In hemifacial microsomia (HFM), nonsynonymous de novo variants in CDC27 have been identified, suggesting a role in craniofacial development. Functional studies in zebrafish indicate that CDC27 knockout results in craniofacial malformations, supporting its involvement in this condition (Song2024Functional).

CDC27 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumorigenesis and treatment outcomes. Overexpression is observed in colorectal, testis, thyroid, gastric cancers, and lung adenocarcinoma, potentially activating oncogenic pathways. Conversely, low expression is noted in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, prostate, glioma, breast cancer, and renal cell carcinomas, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (KazemiSefat2021The).

## Interactions
CDC27 is a core component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is crucial for cell cycle regulation through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. It interacts with other APC/C subunits, including CDC16 and CDC23, forming a complex essential for mitosis. These interactions are mediated by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate both homo- and heteromeric interactions (Lamb1994Cdc16p). CDC27 also interacts with mitotic checkpoint proteins such as Mad2 and BUBR1, which prevent substrate binding to the APC/C, thereby delaying cell cycle progression (Lee2016Identification).

Mutations in the TPR domains of CDC27, particularly in the seventh TPR, can disrupt its interaction with Cdc23p, leading to defects in mitosis (Lamb1994Cdc16p). CDC27 is also involved in the ubiquitination of cyclin B, a process essential for mitotic exit, and interacts with CDC20 and CDH1 to regulate this activity (King1995A; KazemiSefat2021The).

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, CDC27 is part of the DNA polymerase δ complex, interacting with subunits such as Cdc1 and PCNA, which are crucial for DNA replication (Bermudez2002The). Additionally, CDC27 has been identified as a binding partner for Elmo1, suggesting roles beyond cell cycle regulation (Lee2016Identification).
