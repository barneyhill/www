# TTC7B

## Overview
TTC7B is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7B, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of protein complexes. The TTC7B protein is a component of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) complex, specifically interacting with PI4KIIIα and FAM126A, and is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) synthesis at the plasma membrane. This process is essential for the production of signaling lipids that are critical for various cellular functions, including membrane dynamics and signal transduction. TTC7B is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum and cerebral hemisphere, suggesting its involvement in neurological functions. Clinically, variations in the TTC7B gene have been associated with ischemic stroke, neurodevelopmental disorders, and immune response, highlighting its potential significance in both health and disease (Eno202114q32.11; Bustamante2016A; Dornan2018Probing).

## Structure
The TTC7B protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and typically form a helix-turn-helix structure. These motifs contribute to the protein's stable secondary structure, as indicated by hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies, which show that most of the TTC7B protein is protected from exchange, suggesting a well-defined secondary structure (Dornan2018Probing). However, a specific region between residues 620 and 660 exhibits significant exchange, indicating a lack of defined structure in this area (Dornan2018Probing).

The TTC7B protein is part of a larger complex with PI4KIIIα and FAM126A, forming a dimer of trimers, which suggests a quaternary structure involving multiple protein interactions (Dornan2018Probing). The interaction with PI4KIIIα leads to allosteric stabilization, as evidenced by decreased deuterium exchange in regions forming the interface with PI4KIIIα (Dornan2018Probing). The N-terminus of TTC7B shows a minor decrease in exchange, potentially related to membrane binding, with an arginine at residue 9 possibly interacting with negatively charged phospholipids (Dornan2018Probing). The molecular structure of TTC7B alone is not detailed, but its role within the complex is emphasized.

## Function
TTC7B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) activity at the plasma membrane. The TTC7B protein is part of the PI4KIIIα complex, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), a precursor for important signaling lipids such as PIP2 and PIP3. These lipids are essential for various cellular processes, including membrane dynamics and signaling pathways (Lees2017Architecture; Dornan2018Probing).

TTC7B is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. Within the PI4KIIIα complex, TTC7B contributes to the stability and function of the complex, ensuring efficient lipid kinase activity. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is thought to influence cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Dornan2018Probing).

In healthy human cells, TTC7B is highly expressed in the cerebellum and cerebral hemisphere, suggesting a role in neurological functions. Its involvement in phosphoinositide signaling at the plasma membrane underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Eno202114q32.11).

## Clinical Significance
The TTC7B gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily through its association with ischemic stroke (IS) and potential links to cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that TTC7B is differentially expressed in patients with IS, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathophysiology. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TTC7B gene have been associated with an increased risk of IS, although these findings require further validation due to the lack of significance after multiple testing corrections (Krug2012TTC7B).

TTC7B has also been associated with developmental and language delays in patients with microdeletions in the 14q32.11 region, which includes this gene. These deletions suggest a potential role for TTC7B in neurodevelopmental disorders, although the exact contribution of TTC7B alone remains unclear (Eno202114q32.11).

In addition, TTC7B variants have been linked to higher anti-Cytomegalovirus IgG titers and increased risk for diarrheal diseases in children, indicating a possible role in immune response and susceptibility to infections (Bustamante2016A). The gene's involvement in carotid-intima media thickness and atherosclerotic events further underscores its potential significance in cardiovascular health (Wang2019Targeted).

## Interactions
TTC7B is a component of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KA) complex, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. This complex includes PI4KIIIα, FAM126A, and EFR3B, and is involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) production at the plasma membrane. TTC7B interacts with both EFR3 and PI4KA, acting as a shuttle to facilitate the recruitment of PI4KA to the plasma membrane (Lees2017Architecture; UlenginTalkish2021Palmitoylation). 

The interaction between TTC7B and PI4KIIIα is characterized by a stable association, with TTC7B forming a complex with PI4KIIIα and FAM126A. This complex exhibits a dimeric structure, with TTC7B contributing to the stability and enzymatic activity of PI4KIIIα (Lees2017Architecture; Dornan2018Probing). 

TTC7B is also involved in the structural dynamics of the PI4KIIIα complex. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies have shown that TTC7B has regions of structural flexibility, which may contribute to its role in complex formation and stabilization (Dornan2018Probing). 

No interactions of TTC7B with nucleic acids have been reported in the available literature.
