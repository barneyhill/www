# REG4

## Overview
REG4, or regenerating family member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the calcium-dependent lectin superfamily, specifically characterized by a C-type-like lectin domain (CTLD). This protein, also referred to as REG4, is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The REG4 protein is notable for its unique structural adaptation, allowing it to bind carbohydrates in a calcium-independent manner, which is particularly effective in the acidic environment of the gastrointestinal tract (Chen2019Four). Functionally, REG4 is involved in maintaining gut homeostasis and supporting tissue regeneration by acting as a niche for stem cells in the colon (Sasaki2016Reg4). Additionally, REG4 has been implicated in various cancers, where it influences oncogenic pathways and contributes to cancer progression and treatment resistance (Zheng2022REG4).

## Structure
The REG4 protein is characterized by a C-type-like lectin domain (CTLD), which is crucial for its carbohydrate-binding capabilities. Unlike other Reg proteins, REG4 contains a CTLD with two calcium-independent sites that specifically bind to mannan, but not to glucose, mannose, or galactose, allowing it to function effectively in the low-pH environment of the gastrointestinal tract (Chen2019Four). This domain does not include the typical Ca2+-binding motif found in other proteins with CTLDs, indicating a unique structural adaptation (Chen2019Four).

The REG4 protein is 158 amino acids long and includes a 22 amino acid signal peptide, which is a common feature in proteins that are secreted or directed to specific cellular compartments (Zheng2022REG4). The protein also contains an N-glycosylation site, which is a post-translational modification that can affect its stability and function (Zheng2022REG4). While the specific details of the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of REG4 are not provided, its lectin fold is typical of proteins involved in carbohydrate recognition and binding (Qi2020Reg4).

## Function
REG4 (regenerating family member 4) is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon, small intestine, stomach, and pancreas. In healthy human cells, REG4 is constitutively expressed in the colon epithelia, particularly in enteroendocrine cells, and its expression increases during inflammation (van2013REG). REG4 is part of the c-type lectin superfamily and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is suggested to have trophic or anti-apoptotic effects, which may contribute to mucosal protection and repair (van2013REG).

In the colon, REG4 is expressed in deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells, which function as an epithelial niche for Lgr5+ stem cells. These DCS cells provide essential signals for the maintenance and growth of these stem cells, similar to the role of Paneth cells in the small intestine (Sasaki2016Reg4). REG4+ DCS cells are crucial for maintaining the stem cell niche, supporting intestinal homeostasis, and preventing the differentiation and apoptosis of Lgr5+ stem cells (Sasaki2016Reg4). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining gut homeostasis and supporting tissue regeneration.

## Clinical Significance
The REG4 gene is significantly implicated in various cancers, including colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers. In colorectal cancer, REG4 promotes cancer stem cell properties, particularly in cells with KRAS mutations, by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for maintaining cancer stemness and tumor growth (Hwang2019A). Its expression is associated with poor differentiation, venous invasion, and advanced cancer stages, contributing to chemoresistance and increased migration and invasion of cancer cells (Zheng2022REG4).

In gastric cancer, REG4 is linked to aggressive cancer behaviors, drug resistance, and poor prognosis. It facilitates invasion and migration by upregulating SOX9 and promotes proliferation through the protein kinase B pathway (Zheng2022REG4). In pancreatic cancer, REG4 overexpression correlates with poor survival and resistance to radiochemotherapy, promoting tumor growth and invasion by upregulating MMP-7 and MMP-9 (Zheng2022REG4).

REG4 is also involved in ovarian cancer, where its overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and decreased apoptosis, contributing to poor prognosis (Chen2015The). In lung cancer, particularly with KRAS mutations, REG4 is upregulated and associated with cancer progression (Zhang2021The). These findings suggest that alterations in REG4 expression are closely linked to cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
REG4, a member of the calcium-dependent lectin gene superfamily, is involved in various interactions with proteins and cellular components. It interacts with CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein, leading to the cleavage and release of the CD44 intracytoplasmic domain (CD44ICD). This interaction promotes oncogenic transcription and cell proliferation, particularly in colorectal cancer, by activating pathways such as EGFR/Akt and CREB-dependent transcriptional activation of Cyclin D1 (Sninsky2021Reg4; Zheng2022REG4).

REG4 also binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of E. coli, potentially activating complement pathways and promoting bactericidal activity in the gut. This interaction is part of the complement-mediated immune response, where REG4 enhances the deposition of complement component C3, leading to the formation of membrane attack complexes (Qi2020Reg4).

In the context of cancer, REG4 is involved in the activation of the EGFR/Akt pathway, which leads to the overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins and promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival. It also interacts with other proteins such as ADAM9, influencing cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Zhang2021The; Zheng2022REG4).
