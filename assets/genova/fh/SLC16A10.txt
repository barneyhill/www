# SLC16A10

## Overview
The SLC16A10 gene encodes the solute carrier family 16 member 10 (SLC16A10), also known as T-type amino acid transporter 1 (TAT1), which is a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family. This gene is responsible for producing a transmembrane protein that facilitates the transport of aromatic amino acids such as L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine across cell membranes. The SLC16A10 protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices, a structural feature typical of the major facilitator superfamily, and is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the small intestine, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle (Sharlin2018Deafness; Ramadan2005Basolateral). Functionally, SLC16A10 plays a crucial role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis by facilitating the efflux of these amino acids across the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, operating independently of sodium and protons (Halestrap2013The). Alterations in the expression or function of SLC16A10 have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including metabolic disorders and auditory dysfunction, highlighting its significance in physiological and pathological processes (Sharlin2018Deafness; Kandasamy2018Amino).

## Structure
The SLC16A10 gene encodes the TAT1 protein, a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family, specifically classified as MCT10. This protein is characterized by its structure, which includes multiple transmembrane domains. In particular, the Slc16a10 protein is a transmembrane protein with 12 transmembrane helices, a common feature of the major facilitator superfamily (Sharlin2018Deafness). The protein has a unique structural feature, a long NH2-terminal tail with a PEST sequence, which is associated with rapid protein degradation (Ramadan2005Basolateral).

The TAT1 protein is involved in the facilitated diffusion of aromatic amino acids across cell membranes and is expressed in various tissues, including the small intestine, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle (Ramadan2005Basolateral). It is localized to the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells and the sinusoidal side of centrilobular hepatocytes in the liver (Ramadan2005Basolateral). The protein does not undergo N-glycosylation, as indicated by the absence of a shift in band migration after deglycosylation treatment (Ramadan2005Basolateral). The absence of TAT1 in certain tissues can lead to elevated plasma levels of aromatic amino acids, although it does not affect normal development or thyroid hormone function (Mariotta2012T‐type).

## Function
The SLC16A10 gene encodes the T-type amino acid transporter 1 (TAT1), which is crucial for the facilitated diffusion of aromatic amino acids across cell membranes. TAT1 primarily transports amino acids such as L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine, playing a significant role in maintaining extracellular aromatic amino acid homeostasis (Halestrap2013The; Mariotta2012T‐type). This transporter is expressed in various tissues, including the small intestine, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, and is localized to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in these tissues (Ramadan2005Basolateral; Mariotta2012T‐type).

In healthy cells, TAT1 functions as an efflux pathway, facilitating the diffusion of aromatic amino acids across the basolateral membrane, which is essential for overall body amino acid homeostasis (Ramadan2005Basolateral; Mariotta2012T‐type). The absence of TAT1, as observed in knockout mice, leads to increased plasma concentrations of aromatic amino acids and altered epithelial amino acid transport, underscoring its role in regulating amino acid levels in the bloodstream (Mariotta2012T‐type). TAT1 operates independently of sodium and protons, distinguishing it from other transport mechanisms (Halestrap2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SLC16A10 gene, which encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 10 (MCT10), have been associated with several clinical conditions. The absence of SLC16A10, along with SLC16A2, in mice leads to significant auditory dysfunction, including deafness and loss of cochlear hair cells. This suggests that SLC16A10 plays a critical role in auditory function and cochlear health, potentially due to its involvement in thyroid hormone transport (Sharlin2018Deafness). 

Alterations in SLC16A10 expression have also been linked to metabolic disorders. The transporter is involved in the movement of aromatic amino acids, and its dysfunction can lead to aminoaciduria, characterized by the presence of amino acids in the urine, indicating a metabolic imbalance (Kandasamy2018Amino). In the context of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), downregulation of SLC16A10 expression has been observed, which may contribute to increased concentrations of aromatic amino acids like tyrosine and phenylalanine, suggesting a potential role in the progression of NASH (Felmlee2020Monocarboxylate). 

While specific human diseases directly caused by SLC16A10 mutations have not been reported, its role in thyroid hormone and amino acid transport suggests that its dysregulation could impact related metabolic and developmental processes (Felmlee2020Monocarboxylate).
