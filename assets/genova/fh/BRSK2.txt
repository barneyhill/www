# BRSK2

## Overview
BRSK2, or BR serine/threonine kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase belonging to the AMPK subfamily. This kinase is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a pivotal role in neuronal polarization, axon specification, and synaptic function, which are essential for proper neuronal development and function (Guo2006BRSK2; Bright2009The). BRSK2 is activated through phosphorylation by LKB1, a tumor suppressor kinase, and is involved in regulating the cell cycle and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, highlighting its significance in both neurological and metabolic processes (Wang2013BRSK2; Chen2012Brainselective). Mutations in the BRSK2 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, underscoring its clinical importance (Deng2022Deleterious; Hiatt2019Deleterious).

## Structure
BRSK2, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is part of the AMPK subfamily and shares structural similarities with other kinases in this group. The kinase domain of BRSK2 spans amino acids 19-270 and is highly similar to the AMPK α1 and α2 subunits (Guo2006BRSK2). This domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity and is characterized by a bilobed structure typical of kinases. BRSK2 contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is an autoregulatory domain present in several members of the AMPK subgroup (Li2012APCCCdh1; Marx2010Structure).

BRSK2 undergoes phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification, at threonine 260 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), enhancing its kinase activity (Guo2006BRSK2). It is also phosphorylated by LKB1 at T174, which activates BRSK2 (Tamir2020PKIS). The protein is subject to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, regulated by the APC/C Cdh1 complex, with the KEN box being crucial for this process (Li2012APCCCdh1).

BRSK2 interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), affecting its function in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (Wang2013BRSK2). The protein is expressed at high levels in the brain and at lower levels in the testis and pancreas (Li2012APCCCdh1). Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of BRSK2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
BRSK2, also known as brain-specific kinase 2, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in neuronal polarization, which is essential for the development and function of neurons. It is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of axon specification and synaptic function. BRSK2, along with its homolog BRSK1, phosphorylates tau, a microtubule-associated protein, contributing to the stability of the microtubule network and neuronal polarity (Guo2006BRSK2; Bright2009The).

BRSK2 is activated by phosphorylation through LKB1, a tumor suppressor kinase, which is necessary for its role in neuronal polarization in the cerebral cortex (Wang2013BRSK2). It is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in mammalian cells. This function is regulated through its interaction with Jab1, which promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Zhou2012Jab1).

In pancreatic β-cells, BRSK2 negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by phosphorylating PCTAIRE1, a protein involved in insulin secretion (Chen2012Brainselective). This highlights its role in metabolic regulation, making it a potential target for diabetes treatment.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRSK2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). Deleterious variations in BRSK2 have been identified in individuals with these conditions, often presenting with symptoms such as speech delay, motor delay, behavioral issues, and autism (Deng2022Deleterious; Hiatt2019Deleterious). The gene is considered a high-confidence risk factor for ASD, with studies showing a significant association between BRSK2 mutations and the disorder (Deng2023Dynamic; Feliciano2019Exome).

BRSK2 mutations can lead to a range of symptoms, including social defects, anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired motor skills. These mutations are often de novo, meaning they are new mutations not inherited from the parents (Hu2023Case; Hiatt2019Deleterious). In zebrafish models, BRSK2 deficiency has been shown to result in ASD-like behaviors and motor dysfunction, further supporting its role in neurodevelopmental processes (Deng2022Deleterious; Deng2023Dynamic).

The BRSK2 gene is also involved in critical signaling pathways, such as the TSC-mTORC1 pathway, which is linked to autophagy and neuronal development. Disruptions in these pathways due to BRSK2 mutations may contribute to the observed neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions (Hiatt2019Deleterious).

## Interactions
BRSK2 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It interacts with c-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1), which promotes the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of BRSK2. This interaction was confirmed through GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, both in vitro and in vivo. Jab1's overexpression leads to a reduction in BRSK2 levels, while its silencing increases BRSK2 protein levels, indicating a regulatory mechanism for BRSK2 through Jab1 (Zhou2012Jab1).

BRSK2 also interacts with the valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), affecting its function in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, showing that BRSK2 co-precipitates with VCP/p97, except for its D1 domain. BRSK2 and VCP/p97 co-localize in cells, particularly under ER stress conditions, suggesting a functional interaction in ERAD (Wang2013BRSK2).

Additionally, BRSK2 is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) at Thr260, enhancing its kinase activity. This interaction was confirmed using GST pull-down assays, indicating a physical association between BRSK2 and PKA (Guo2006BRSK2).
