# ARID3A

## Overview
ARID3A is a gene that encodes the AT-rich interaction domain 3A protein, a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind to AT-rich DNA sequences, playing a pivotal role as a transcription factor in various biological processes. The ARID3A protein is involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, particularly influencing the development and differentiation of B lymphocytes, and is crucial for maintaining immune responses and embryonic development. It contains distinct structural domains, including the ARID domain and the REKLES domain, which facilitate its DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction capabilities. ARID3A's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation, which affect its localization and function. Dysregulation of ARID3A expression has been linked to several diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis, liver cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2023A; Ratliff2016The; Shen2022Hepatic).

## Structure
ARID3A is a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins, characterized by the presence of an ARID domain that facilitates binding to AT-rich DNA sequences. The ARID domain is approximately 100 amino acids long and contains six helices (H1-H6) forming the minimal ARID core domain. This core can be extended by additional helices, H0 and H7, in some proteins, referred to as eARID (Korn2022Structures). The ARID domain includes a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, with helix H5 acting as the DNA recognition helix. The hydrophobic core, formed between helices H2 and H5, is crucial for the domain's functionality (Korn2022Structures).

ARID3A also contains a REKLES domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that allows shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Korn2022Structures). The REKLES domain is divided into two sub-domains: REKLES-α and REKLES-β, with the latter being highly conserved and necessary for nuclear import and export (Tidwell2011Characterization).

ARID3A undergoes post-translational modification through SUMO-I conjugation, which affects its localization and function (Tidwell2011Characterization). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties (Tidwell2011Characterization).

## Function
The ARID3A gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of hematopoiesis, particularly in the development of B lymphocytes. It is expressed in a subset of human hematopoietic progenitor stem cells and is involved in the differentiation of these cells into various blood cell lineages (Ratliff2016The). ARID3A functions as a DNA-binding protein, interacting with A/T-rich DNA sequences to enhance immunoglobulin transcription in activated B cells. This activity is crucial for increasing transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and improving chromatin accessibility (Ratliff2014The).

In healthy human cells, ARID3A is expressed in effector B lymphocytes, which are capable of secreting interferon alpha (IFNa). This expression is associated with robust IFNa secretion, indicating a role in modulating immune responses (Ward2016Human). ARID3A is also involved in the regulation of cell-fate decisions in embryonic stem cells, where it suppresses lineage plasticity and maintains the differentiated state (Hayakawa2019Crucial).

ARID3A is active in the nucleus and influences processes like immune response and embryonic development, impacting organismal outcomes such as hematopoiesis and B-cell lineage commitment (Ratliff2016The). Its expression is crucial for the balance between B and myeloid lineage development in human hematopoietic cells (Ratliff2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARID3A gene have been implicated in several diseases. In primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), ARID3A expression is significantly increased in the liver's portal area, correlating with liver inflammation and fibrosis stages. The rs2238574 SNP within the ARID3A gene is identified as a potential causal variant for PBC, with the risk allele linked to higher liver fibrosis stages. This variant acts as a myeloid cell-specific enhancer, influencing ARID3A expression and contributing to PBC susceptibility (Li2023A).

In liver cancer, high ARID3A expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and an embryonic stem cell-like gene expression signature. It is upregulated in tumor tissues and correlates with cancer stemness markers, promoting tumor progression and metastasis (Shen2022Hepatic).

ARID3A is also linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where its increased expression in B lymphocytes is associated with elevated interferon-alpha production and disease activity. This overexpression is observed in various B cell subsets, contributing to the autoimmune dysregulation characteristic of SLE (Ratliff2019ARID3a; Garton2019New). In acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), particularly in Down syndrome, ARID3A is repressed by miR-125b, affecting megakaryocytic differentiation and contributing to leukemia pathogenesis (AlejoValle2021The).

## Interactions
ARID3A, a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins, engages in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to bind DNA through a modified helix-turn-helix motif, specifically targeting the major groove, and plays a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Liu2010Solution). ARID3A interacts with the p53 protein, acting as a downstream target in the DNA damage response pathway. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of the p21 WAF1 promoter, where ARID3A binds to specific sites in cooperation with p53 (Lestari2012Cooperation).

ARID3A also forms heterodimers with E2F, stimulating E2F-dependent transcription, and binds to E2F target genes such as Cdc2, cyclin E1, and p107, enhancing transcriptional activity (Saadat2021Distinct). It interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB), sequestering the RB-HDAC1 complex from the E2F1 promoter, which is significant in oncogenic transformation (Saadat2021Distinct). Additionally, ARID3A undergoes SUMO modification, interacting with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and is sumoylated at Lys 398, with PIASy acting as a specific SUMO E3-ligase (Liu2010Solution). These interactions highlight ARID3A's multifaceted role in gene regulation and cellular processes.
