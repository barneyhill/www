# CDK13

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 13 (CDK13) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 13, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in transcription regulation and mRNA processing. The CDK13 protein functions as a kinase, forming a complex with Cyclin K, and is involved in the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, a critical process for transcriptional elongation and processivity (Fan2020CDK13; Greenleaf2018Human). Additionally, CDK13 is implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing through its interactions with L-type cyclins, influencing splice site recognition and pre-mRNA splicing patterns (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5). Mutations in the CDK13 gene are associated with developmental disorders, including intellectual disability and congenital anomalies, highlighting its clinical significance (Hamilton2017Heterozygous; Hamilton2019CDK13related).

## Structure
CDK13 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that forms a complex with Cyclin K, playing a role in transcription regulation and mRNA processing. The primary structure of CDK13 includes N-terminal and C-terminal arms, similar to those of CDK12, with a central kinase homology region (Greenleaf2018Human). CDK13 shares about 92% identity in the kinase domain with CDK12, indicating a high degree of structural similarity (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5). The protein contains low-complexity sequences, including arginine-rich, serine-rich, and proline-rich motifs, which are thought to be functionally important (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5).

The quaternary structure of CDK13 involves its interaction with Cyclin K, forming a heterodimeric complex. This complex is crucial for its kinase activity, which is influenced by segments outside the kinase homology core region (Greenleaf2018Human). CDK13 also interacts with L-type cyclins, such as Cyclin L1a and Cyclin L2a, which contain an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal RS domain (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to play a role in CDK13's function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context. Splice variants of CDK13 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties, but specific isoforms are not described in the provided information.

## Function
CDK13, a cyclin-dependent kinase, plays a crucial role in regulating transcription and RNA processing in human cells. It is involved in the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for transcriptional elongation and processivity (Fan2020CDK13; Greenleaf2018Human). CDK13, in conjunction with CDK12, maintains RNA polymerase II elongation rates and prevents premature transcription termination, thereby ensuring proper gene expression (Fan2020CDK13).

CDK13 is also implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing. It interacts with L-type cyclins, such as Cyclin L1a and Cyclin L2a, and influences splice site recognition and the splicing pattern of pre-mRNA (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5). This interaction is crucial for the mutual modulation of their subcellular localization, as CDK13 can be attracted to nuclear speckles by L-type cyclins (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5).

In terms of cellular outcomes, CDK13 affects the expression of genes involved in RNA processing and splicing regulation, impacting processes like cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5; Liang2015Characterization). Its activity is essential for maintaining proper transcriptional responses and cellular viability (Fan2020CDK13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDK13 gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders, primarily characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay. These mutations often affect the protein kinase domain of CDK13, leading to a syndromic form of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Clinical features include craniofacial dysmorphism, structural heart defects, and brain abnormalities such as hypoplasia or absence of the corpus callosum. Patients may also experience feeding difficulties, seizures, autism spectrum disorders, and sensorineural hearing impairment (Hamilton2017Heterozygous; Hamilton2019CDK13related).

Specific missense mutations, such as Gly717Arg and Asn842Ser, have been shown to disrupt the protein's structure and function, potentially leading to a loss of catalytic activity while retaining cyclin K binding. This suggests a dominant negative effect, where the mutant protein interferes with normal protein function (Hamilton2017Heterozygous). Additionally, mutations in the CCNK gene, which encodes cyclin K, can destabilize the CDK13/cyclin K complex, further contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Łukasik2021Cyclin-Dependent).

CDK13-related disorders have also been linked to congenital heart disease and other structural anomalies, with some cases showing intrauterine growth restriction and microcephaly (Hamilton2019CDK13related). There is emerging evidence suggesting a potential risk of cancer development in individuals with CDK13-related disorders, as highlighted by a case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and leukemia in a patient with a CDK13 mutation (Cui2022Case).

## Interactions
CDK13 interacts with L-type cyclins, specifically Cyclin L1a and Cyclin L1b, through its kinase domain and C-terminal portion, which associate with the cyclin domains of these cyclins. This interaction has been demonstrated through immunoprecipitation experiments, showing that full-length CDK13 and its truncated constructs can bind to Cyclin L1. These interactions influence the cellular localization of both CDK13 and L-type cyclins, with L-type cyclins attracting CDK13 into nuclear speckles and CDK13 modulating the distribution of Cyclin L1b between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Chen2007CDK13CDC2L5).

CDK13 also forms complexes with Cyclin K, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression through the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, crucial for transcriptional elongation (Bai2023Structural; Kohoutek2012Cyclin). CDK13 is associated with numerous RNA processing factors, including the splicing factor SRSF1 and its inhibitory subunit C1QBP, indicating direct physical interactions with these components (Liang2015Characterization). These interactions suggest a role for CDK13 in RNA processing and transcription regulation, impacting RNA polymerase II processivity and elongation (Fan2020CDK13).
