# EPHX1

## Overview
The EPHX1 gene encodes the enzyme epoxide hydrolase 1, a crucial component of the body's detoxification system. This enzyme, categorized as a hydrolase, is primarily located in the microsomal membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the conversion of potentially harmful epoxide compounds into less toxic diol forms. This process is vital for protecting cells from genotoxic and cytotoxic stress caused by xenobiotics, which include drugs, toxins, and procarcinogens (ElSherbeni2014The; Gautheron2020The). Beyond its detoxification role, epoxide hydrolase 1 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous compounds, such as steroids and endocannabinoids, thereby influencing various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, stress response, and inflammation (Gautheron2020The). The gene's expression in diverse tissues underscores its multifaceted functions, and its activity is modulated by hormonal and bioactive factors, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease pathophysiology (Gautheron2020The).

## Structure
The EPHX1 gene encodes the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), a protein consisting of 455 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 51 kDa (ElSherbeni2014The). The primary structure includes an N-terminal membrane anchor, which retains the protein in the microsomal membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (Gautheron2021EPHX1). The secondary structure of mEH is characterized by the α/β hydrolase fold, a common motif in enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxides (Decker2009Mammalian; Gautheron2021EPHX1).

The tertiary structure of mEH includes a catalytic triad composed of Asp226, Glu404, and His431, supported by two tyrosine residues, Tyr299 and Tyr374, which help position the epoxide substrate (Decker2009Mammalian; Gautheron2021EPHX1). Although the exact quaternary structure of EPHX1 is not available, it is speculated to exist in a dimeric form, similar to a homologous enzyme from Aspergillus niger (Decker2009Mammalian).

The EPHX1 gene structure allows for alternative non-coding exons, which may lead to different promoter usage and potentially different isoforms, although specific splice variants are not detailed (Decker2009Mammalian). The enzyme is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential biological function (ElSherbeni2014The).

## Function
EPHX1, or epoxide hydrolase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the detoxification processes within human cells, particularly in the liver. It catalyzes the conversion of xenobiotic epoxide substrates, which are derived from drugs, toxins, and procarcinogens, into more polar diol metabolites. This conversion helps protect cells from chemical-induced genotoxic and cytotoxic stress (Gautheron2020The). EPHX1 is primarily localized in the microsomal fraction of the endoplasmic reticulum, where its catalytic domain is exposed at the cytosolic membrane surface (Gautheron2020The).

Beyond detoxification, EPHX1 is involved in regulating endogenous steroid metabolism, which affects energy metabolism, stress response, and sexual development. It also plays a role in the endocannabinoid signaling pathway by metabolizing 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), influencing inflammation, vasodilation, and cell growth (Gautheron2020The). EPHX1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, adrenal gland, ovary, and adipose tissue, indicating its pleiotropic functions across multiple tissues (Gautheron2020The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by factors such as hormones and bioactive compounds, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cell homeostasis and influencing the pathophysiology of various conditions (Gautheron2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the EPHX1 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. EPHX1 polymorphisms, particularly rs1051740 (Tyr113His) and rs2234922 (His139Arg), have been linked to an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The rs1051740 polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of COPD, while rs2234922 may confer a protective effect, especially in certain ethnic groups such as Asians and Caucasians (Yang2023EPHX1). 

EPHX1 mutations have also been implicated in a lipoatrophic diabetes syndrome characterized by impaired epoxide hydrolysis and increased cellular senescence. These mutations lead to increased oxidative stress and cellular senescence, affecting adipocyte differentiation and insulin response, contributing to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction (Gautheron2021EPHX1). 

Additionally, EPHX1 variants have been associated with susceptibility to various cancers, including esophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, although the pathogenic roles of these variants remain uncertain (Gautheron2020The). The gene's involvement in detoxifying reactive epoxides suggests that alterations in its activity could impact the body's response to environmental toxins and influence disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
EPHX1 (epoxide hydrolase 1) is known to participate in several protein interactions. It has been identified as a potential direct-interaction partner of microsomal cytochrome b5 (CYB5A), forming part of a heterocomplex with CYB5A, catalase (CAT), and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) in the region of approximately 200 kDa. In higher-molecular-weight complexes (250-450 kDa), EPHX1 co-fractionates with CYB5A and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2), suggesting physical interactions within these complexes (Mezentsev2022Protein).

EPHX1 also interacts with the hepatitis B spliced protein (HBSP), enhancing its hydrolysis activity. This interaction is confirmed through various assays, including GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation, and is localized to the N-terminal half of HBSP. The interaction between HBSP and EPHX1 accelerates the metabolism of benzo[alpha]pyrene (B[alpha]P), leading to increased formation of BPDE-DNA adducts and promoting carcinogenic processes in hepatoma cells (Chen2014Hepatitis).

These interactions highlight EPHX1's role in metabolic pathways and its potential involvement in disease processes through its interactions with other proteins.
