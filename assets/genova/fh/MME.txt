# MME

## Overview
The MME gene encodes the protein membrane metalloendopeptidase, commonly known as neprilysin, which is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. Neprilysin is a type II integral membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the degradation of various bioactive peptides, including peptide hormones and neuropeptides. It is predominantly expressed on the cell surface, where it functions as an ectoenzyme, catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptides at the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. This protein is involved in numerous physiological processes, including the regulation of neuropeptides and hormones, cardiovascular function, and potentially in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease due to its role in degrading beta-amyloid peptides. Mutations in the MME gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, underscoring its clinical significance (Higuchi2016Mutations; Turner2001The; AuerGrumbach2016Rare).

## Structure
The MME protein, also known as neprilysin, is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease with a complex molecular structure. It is a type II integral membrane protein composed of a single polypeptide chain, which includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, and a large extracellular domain where the active site is located (Turner2001The; Debiec2004Role). The extracellular domain is characterized by a bilobal structure formed by two predominantly alpha-helical halves, with the active site situated at the interface between these lobes (Pereira2010Natriuretic). This domain also contains a conserved pentapeptide zinc-binding motif crucial for its enzymatic activity (Debiec2004Role).

The tertiary structure of MME includes a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding site, essential for its function in peptide degradation (Oefner2000Structure). MME can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, and features common post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Turner2001The). The protein's structure is further stabilized by disulfide bridges, with ten conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular domain (Turner2001The). These structural features contribute to MME's role in the metabolism of various bioactive peptides.

## Function
The MME gene encodes the enzyme neprilysin, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease involved in the degradation of various peptide hormones and neuropeptides, including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and natriuretic peptides (AuerGrumbach2016Rare; Pereira2010Natriuretic). Neprilysin is primarily active on the cell surface, functioning as an ectoenzyme that catalyzes peptide hydrolysis at the extracellular face of the plasma membrane (Turner2001The). It preferentially cleaves oligopeptides on the N-terminal side of hydrophobic amino acid residues, playing a crucial role in terminating peptide signaling events at the cell surface (Turner2001The).

In healthy human cells, neprilysin is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, lung, brain, and peripheral nervous system (AuerGrumbach2016Rare; Pereira2010Natriuretic). It is involved in the regulation of neuropeptides and hormones, maintaining their balance and preventing excessive accumulation, which could otherwise lead to pathological conditions (AuerGrumbach2016Rare). Neprilysin also plays a significant role in cardiovascular function by metabolizing vasodilator peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), thus influencing blood pressure regulation (Turner2001The). Additionally, neprilysin's activity in degrading neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide suggests a potential link to Alzheimer's disease (AuerGrumbach2016Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MME gene, which encodes the enzyme neprilysin, are associated with several neurological disorders. One significant condition linked to MME mutations is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by progressive weakness, atrophy of distal limb muscles, and sensory disturbances. Histopathological examinations of affected individuals reveal a decrease in the density of large myelinated fibers and thin myelin sheaths, with a loss of NEP expression in the myelin sheath (Higuchi2016Mutations; Grosz2024A).

MME variants are also implicated in late-onset axonal polyneuropathies, which can manifest as autosomal-dominant conditions with age-related incomplete penetrance. These variants often result in decreased neprilysin activity, leading to progressive gait disturbances and distal muscle wasting (AuerGrumbach2016Rare). In some cases, heterozygous MME variants confer a risk for neuropathy, while biallelic variants result in autosomal recessive CMT2 with age-related complete penetrance (Senderek2020The).

Additionally, MME mutations have been linked to distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), characterized by progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy without sensory abnormalities (Hong2019Variants). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of MME gene mutations in peripheral neuropathies.

## Interactions
Membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME), also known as neprilysin, participates in various protein interactions that influence its function in different biological processes. MME interacts with proteins involved in the FoxO and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, which are associated with tumorigenesis. Notable MME-binding proteins include PTEN and BCL6, which play roles in these pathways (Ding2023Membrane).

In the context of neuroendocrine tumors, MME expression is regulated by the interaction between the tumor suppressor proteins menin and Daxx. These proteins co-regulate MME expression through epigenetic mechanisms, enhancing histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) at the MME promoter. This regulation involves the recruitment of the histone H3 methyltransferase SUV39H1, facilitated by the interaction between menin and Daxx (Feng2017Menin).

MME also interacts with various peptides, including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and natriuretic peptides, playing a role in their degradation. This interaction is significant in cardiac and kidney tissues, where MME is upregulated in conditions like aortic stenosis and heart failure (Pereira2010Natriuretic).
