# NFX1

## Overview
The NFX1 gene encodes the nuclear transcription factor, X-box binding 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes zinc finger domains and a RING finger motif, suggesting its involvement in DNA binding and ubiquitination activities. NFX1 exists in multiple isoforms, notably NFX1-91 and NFX1-123, which have distinct functional roles. NFX1-91 primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor, particularly of the hTERT promoter, influencing telomerase activity and cellular senescence. In contrast, NFX1-123 is involved in post-transcriptional regulation, enhancing telomerase activity and contributing to cellular growth and differentiation. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including its role in HPV-related oncogenesis, underscore its clinical significance in cancer and immune response regulation (Chintala2021NFX1; Katzenellenbogen2007NFX1123; Gewin2004Identification).

## Structure
The NFX1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes a central cysteine-rich region and a RING finger motif. The cysteine-rich region contains several NFX1-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and are stabilized by metal ions like zinc (Müssig2010Structure; Lisso2011NFX1LIKE2). The RING finger motif, with a C4HC3 Zn ligand signature, suggests E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Müssig2010Structure; Lisso2011NFX1LIKE2).

NFX1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at multiple sites, which may regulate its function (Song1994A). The protein exists in different splice variant isoforms, notably NFX1-123 and NFX1-91, which have distinct C-terminal regions. NFX1-123 contains nine zinc fingers and an R3H domain, while NFX1-91 has seven zinc fingers and lacks the R3H domain (Müssig2010Structure; Gewin2004Identification). These structural differences contribute to their varied roles in transcriptional regulation, with NFX1-123 acting as a co-activator and NFX1-91 as a repressor (Gewin2004Identification).

## Function
The NFX1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator by binding to X-box motifs in DNA. In healthy human cells, NFX1 plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and post-translational modification, influencing various cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of immune pathways and responses to inflammation, acting as a transcriptional repressor of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, which are essential for immune response (Chintala2021NFX1; Song1994A).

NFX1 is also implicated in the regulation of telomerase activity. The NFX1-91 isoform acts as a transcriptional repressor of the hTERT promoter, which is crucial for maintaining telomerase expression and cellular senescence. This repression is mediated through its interaction with the hTERT promoter and the formation of a complex with other proteins such as PKC-delta and histone deacetylase 1 (Chintala2021NFX1; Gewin2004Identification).

In addition to its role in transcriptional repression, NFX1-123, another isoform, is involved in post-transcriptional regulation by stabilizing hTERT mRNA, thereby increasing telomerase activity. This isoform is associated with cellular growth and differentiation, particularly in epithelial cells (Chintala2021NFX1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the NFX1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and immune response. In humans, NFX1 is involved in the life cycle of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, especially in epithelial cells. The NFX1-123 splice variant interacts with the HPV type 16 E6 oncoprotein, promoting cellular growth and immortalization, which are crucial for HPV-associated oncogenesis. High expression of NFX1-123 is observed in HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines and primary cervical cancers, as well as in HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) (Chintala2021NFX1; Quist2021Cervical).

NFX1-123 also plays a role in immune regulation by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes, aiding HPV in evading immune detection (Levan2017Human). Beyond HPV-related cancers, NFX1 expression is implicated in other cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it may influence oncogenesis pathways and treatment responses (Chintala2021NFX1). Variants of NFX1 have been linked to specific language impairments, intracranial aneurysms, and esophageal atresia, indicating its role in central nervous system development, vascular disorders, and gastrointestinal development (Chintala2021NFX1).

## Interactions
The NFX1 gene encodes a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms. NFX1 has two splice variants, NFX1-91 and NFX1-123, which exhibit distinct interaction profiles. NFX1-91 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the hTERT promoter by binding to a specific region within the promoter, and it is targeted for degradation by the HPV16 E6/E6-AP complex through ubiquitin-mediated pathways (Chintala2021NFX1; Gewin2004Identification).

NFX1-123, in contrast, interacts with cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins (PABPCs) through its PAM2 motif, enhancing hTERT expression and telomerase activity in HPV16 E6-expressing cells. This interaction is crucial for the posttranscriptional regulation of hTERT mRNA, contributing to increased telomerase activity (Katzenellenbogen2009NFX1123; Katzenellenbogen2007NFX1123). NFX1-123 also interacts with the deubiquitinase USP9X, which stabilizes NFX1-123 by preventing its ubiquitination-dependent degradation (Chen2019Identification).

These interactions highlight the role of NFX1 in regulating gene expression and its involvement in oncogenic pathways, particularly in the context of HPV-related cancers (VlietGregg2013NFX1123).
