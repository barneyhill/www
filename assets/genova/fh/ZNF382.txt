# ZNF382

## Overview
ZNF382 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 382, a member of the Krüppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, utilizing its C2H2-type zinc finger domains for DNA binding and its KRAB domain for transcriptional inhibition. Zinc finger protein 382 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in pathways related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, and plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is expressed during early human embryonic development and in specific adult tissues, underscoring its importance in normal cellular function and development. The protein's ability to modulate key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, highlights its role in preventing tumorigenesis and its potential implications in cancer biology (Zhang2018The; Chen2020ZNF382:).

## Function
ZNF382 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is a member of the Krüppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) family and contains C2H2-type zinc finger domains and a KRAB domain, which are essential for its function as a transcription inhibitor (Chen2020ZNF382:). The C2H2 zinc finger domains enable ZNF382 to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, while the KRAB domain acts as a strong transcriptional repressor by binding to co-suppressors (Chen2020ZNF382:).

ZNF382 is widely expressed during early human embryonic development and is selectively expressed in adult tissues, indicating its importance in normal cellular function and development (Chen2020ZNF382:). It is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. ZNF382 inhibits the expression of several oncogenes and is involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, by targeting key components such as FZD1 and DVL2 (Zhang2018The). This regulatory activity helps maintain normal cell function and prevent tumorigenesis (Chen2020ZNF382:).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF382 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZNF382 is frequently downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is a common epigenetic alteration in cancers. This hypermethylation leads to decreased expression of ZNF382, although it is not an independent prognostic factor for survival in pediatric AML (TAO2014Zinc). The gene's downregulation is associated with increased clonogenicity and proliferation of tumor cells, as well as reduced apoptosis, partly by inhibiting NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways (TAO2014Zinc).

In other cancers, such as HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ZNF382 is also frequently methylated, leading to its downregulation. This downregulation is linked to poor survival in early HCC patients and is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Ning2020A). In gastric cancer, ZNF382 can reverse epithelial to mesenchymal transition through NOTCH signaling, and in ESCC, it inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Ning2020A). These findings suggest that ZNF382's epigenetic regulation plays a significant role in cancer pathogenesis and progression.

## Interactions
ZNF382 is a transcriptional regulator that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to modulate gene expression. It contains a C2H2 zinc finger domain that allows it to bind to specific DNA sequences, influencing chromatin structure and gene activity (Chen2020ZNF382:). ZNF382 interacts with KAP1, a protein that binds to chromatin remodeling factors, affecting gene expression by converting euchromatin into heterochromatin (Chen2020ZNF382:). This interaction is part of a conventional KAP1-centered interactome, suggesting ZNF382's potential as a repressor (Helleboid2019The).

In the context of cancer, ZNF382 has been shown to bind directly to the promoter regions of FZD1 and DVL2, impacting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhang2018The). This binding leads to the downregulation of downstream target genes involved in cancer progression, such as C-MYC and CYCLIND1 (Zhang2018The). ZNF382 also represses NF-κB and AP-1 promoters, leading to decreased levels of NF-κB-related genes, which affects cell cycle and proliferation in cancer cells (Lim2015Transcriptional). These interactions highlight ZNF382's role in regulating critical signaling pathways and gene expression in various cancers.
