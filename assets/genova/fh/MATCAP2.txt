# MATCAP2

## Overview
The MATCAP2 gene encodes the protein microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase 2, which is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a key component of the microtubule network within cells. This protein is categorized as a carboxypeptidase, an enzyme that removes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from a protein or peptide. The activity of microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase 2 is crucial for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability, impacting cellular processes such as mitosis, intracellular transport, and cell signaling. Dysregulation of this protein's function has been implicated in various pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in the study of diseases related to microtubule dysfunction (Qiu2020aarFDC).
