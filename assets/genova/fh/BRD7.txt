# BRD7

## Overview
BRD7 is a gene that encodes the bromodomain-containing protein 7, which is a member of the bromodomain family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, playing a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. As a component of the polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor (PBAF) complex, BRD7 is involved in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, influencing gene expression by modulating chromatin accessibility (Cong2005The; Park2020Emerging). The protein interacts with several key regulatory proteins, including p53, and is implicated in various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, insulin signaling, and glucose metabolism (Kim2016The; Burrows2010Polybromoassociated). Clinically, BRD7 is recognized for its tumor suppressor functions, with its expression levels being altered in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it often correlates with patient prognosis (Chen2021BRD7; Park2020Emerging).

## Structure
The BRD7 protein is characterized by a bromodomain, which is a conserved module of approximately 110 amino acids. The bromodomain of BRD7 adopts a typical left-handed four-helix bundle topology, consisting of four antiparallel alpha-helices named aZ, aA, aB, and aC. These helices are connected by loops, with a long ZA loop containing a short alpha-helix named aA0 and a 3_10 helix, and a shorter BC loop (Sun2007Solution).

The ZA loop and BC loop form a hydrophobic pocket, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. This pocket is lined by residues such as F27, F28, V32, I36, A37, Y40, I43, Y82, and Y89, many of which are highly conserved across bromodomains, indicating their importance in maintaining the structure and function of the bromodomain (Sun2007Solution).

BRD7 interacts with acetylated lysine residues on histones, specifically binding to acetylated peptides from histones H3 and H4. The binding affinity is relatively weak, suggesting that other mechanisms may facilitate its recruitment in vivo (Sun2007Solution). The protein is also involved in transcriptional repression through its interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes (Tae2011Bromodomain).

## Function
BRD7 is a bromodomain-containing protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. It is a component of the polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor (PBAF) complex, which is involved in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. BRD7 binds to acetylated histones through its bromodomain, facilitating transcriptional regulation by modulating the accessibility of chromatin to transcription factors (Cong2005The; Park2020Emerging).

BRD7 interacts with several key proteins, including p53, to regulate transcriptional activities. It is involved in the transcriptional control of p53 target genes, such as p21, which is crucial for cell cycle arrest and senescence. This interaction is independent of its bromodomain, suggesting a dual role in chromatin binding and protein interaction (Burrows2010Polybromoassociated).

BRD7 also plays a role in cell cycle progression by inhibiting the G1-S phase transition. It downregulates proteins in the ras/MEK/ERK and E2F/Rb pathways, thereby negatively regulating cell growth (Zhou2004BRD7). In addition, BRD7 is involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, interacting with components of the PI3K pathway to influence cellular homeostasis (Kim2016The; Park2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
BRD7 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In cancer, BRD7 often acts as a tumor suppressor. It is frequently deleted in breast tumors, where its overexpression can suppress metastasis by degrading the oncogenic protein YB1 (Park2020Emerging). In colorectal cancer, BRD7 is downregulated, correlating with poorer patient survival (Park2020Emerging). In hepatocellular carcinoma, BRD7 is downregulated, and higher levels are associated with better outcomes due to its role in activating the p53 pathway (Chen2021BRD7). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, BRD7 is downregulated, which correlates with poor prognosis, and it negatively regulates the oncomiRNA miR-141, affecting the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway (Liu2016miR141). In ovarian cancer, BRD7 expression is decreased, and its overexpression increases apoptosis and inhibits migration (Park2014Tumor). BRD7 also plays a role in insulin signaling, affecting glycogen synthesis, and its levels decrease in obesity, impacting weight gain and glucose homeostasis (Park2020Emerging). In non-small cell lung cancer, BRD7 is downregulated due to microRNA-410, affecting Akt phosphorylation (Park2020Emerging).

## Interactions
BRD7, a bromodomain-containing protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the E1B-AP5 protein, co-localizing in the nucleus of H1299 cells, although the bromodomain of BRD7 is not involved in this interaction (KZHYSHKOWSKA2003Regulation). BRD7 also forms complexes with histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, with the bromodomain being crucial for binding to acetylated histone H3 (Cong2005The).

BRD7 is a component of the hSWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex, interacting with subunits such as BRG1, BRM, and PRMT5, and is involved in transcriptional repression (Tae2011Bromodomain). It also interacts with the PRC2 complex, specifically with SUZ12 and EZH2, contributing to transcriptional repression of target genes (Tae2011Bromodomain).

In cancer biology, BRD7 interacts with p53, facilitating the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, and with BRCA1, influencing the transcription of ERα in breast cancer (Park2020Emerging). It also binds to Y box binding protein-1 (YB1), leading to its degradation in breast cancer cell lines (Park2020Emerging).
