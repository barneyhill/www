# SMARCA1

## Overview
SMARCA1 is a gene that encodes the SNF2L protein, a member of the ISWI family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins. The SNF2L protein plays a pivotal role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression by altering nucleosome positioning, thereby facilitating or restricting access to DNA for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. This protein is integral to various chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the NURF and CERF complexes, which are involved in critical biological processes including brain development and neurulation (Goodwin2018The; Lazzaro2008Characterization). The gene's expression is notably enhanced in differentiating neuronal populations, indicating its importance in neuronal differentiation and development (Lazzaro2008Characterization). Additionally, SMARCA1 has been implicated in several cancers and neurological disorders, with its expression levels serving as potential prognostic markers in various tumor types (Dai2022A; Vaicekauskaitė2022The).

## Structure
The SMARCA1 gene encodes the SNF2L protein, a member of the ISWI family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins. The SNF2L protein contains several conserved domains crucial for its function, including the DNA-binding domain (DBINO), HAND domain, SLIDE domain, Helicase superfamily c-terminal domain (HELICc), and the 'SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR and TFIIIB' DNA-binding domains (SANT) (Dai2022A; Ferraro2016Altered). These domains facilitate interactions with DNA and histones, enabling chromatin remodeling activities.

The SNF2L protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms such as SNF2LA and SNF2LB, which differ in their amino-terminal sequences. SNF2LB aligns with the murine sequence, while SNF2LA is unique to humans (Lazzaro2008Characterization). Alternative splicing also affects the nuclear localization of the protein, with some isoforms lacking a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and localizing to the cytoplasm (Lazzaro2008Characterization).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, have been observed, with higher phosphorylation levels in primary tumor tissues compared to normal tissues in certain cancers (Dai2022A). These modifications and isoform variations can influence the protein's activity and interactions, impacting its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.

## Function
The SMARCA1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the ISWI family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, which play a crucial role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. This protein is involved in various DNA-dependent processes, including transcription, replication, and repair, by modifying the nucleosomal architecture to regulate DNA accessibility. This facilitates the binding of transcription factors to DNA regions, influencing gene expression and repression (A2018Loss).

SMARCA1 is a significant component of chromatin remodeling complexes such as the NURF complex, which regulates the expression of genes important in brain development, including the engrailed genes. It is also part of the CERF complex, which involves the CECR2 protein, a transcription factor crucial for neurulation (Lazzaro2008Characterization). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the accessibility of DNA to various transcription factors and other proteins, influencing cell differentiation and development (Dai2022A).

The expression of SMARCA1 is enhanced in differentiating neuronal populations, suggesting its role in neuronal differentiation (Lazzaro2008Characterization). Its involvement in chromatin remodeling is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and regulating the transition of cells from a committed progenitor state to a differentiated state (Dai2022A).

## Clinical Significance
SMARCA1, a gene involved in chromatin remodeling, has been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders due to mutations, expression alterations, and changes in its interactions. In cancer, SMARCA1 expression levels vary significantly across different tumor types, influencing patient prognosis. High SMARCA1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in lower-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma, while low expression correlates with poor outcomes in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Dai2022A). In breast cancer, low SMARCA1 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes, despite elevated protein levels in tumor tissues (Dai2022A).

In ovarian cancer, SMARCA1 mutations occur in up to 2% of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cases, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis (Vaicekauskaitė2022The). The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling and its expression in differentiating neuronal populations also make it a candidate for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) (Lazzaro2008Characterization). Although no direct mutations were found in XLMR patients, regulatory mutations affecting SMARCA1 expression remain a possibility (Lazzaro2008Characterization). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SMARCA1 in both cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
SMARCA1, also known as SNF2L, is a component of the ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes, which play a crucial role in nucleosome positioning and gene regulation. SMARCA1 interacts with BAZ domain-containing proteins to form distinct remodeling complexes, such as the NURF complex, which is involved in regulating the expression of engrailed genes important for brain development (Goodwin2018The; Lazzaro2008Characterization). 

The protein is part of the CERF chromatin remodeling complex, which includes the CECR2 protein, a transcription factor involved in neurulation, indicating its role in neurodevelopmental processes (Lazzaro2008Characterization). SMARCA1 is also associated with repressive chromatin marks like H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, suggesting its involvement in closed chromatin states (Villaseñor2020ChromID).

In the context of cancer, SMARCA1 has been linked to various pathways, including those related to pyrimidine and purine metabolism, and chromatin remodeling processes such as ubiquitin-protein transferase activity and histone acetyltransferase complex (Dai2022A). These interactions highlight SMARCA1's involvement in significant biological processes related to both neurodevelopment and cancer.
