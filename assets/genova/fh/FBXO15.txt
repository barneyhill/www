# FBXO15

## Overview
FBXO15 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 15, a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box motif. This motif is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where F-box proteins serve as substrate recognition components of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. F-box protein 15 is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including protein degradation, signal transduction, and cell cycle control. It plays a significant role in modulating the stability and ubiquitination of key proteins such as SOX2 and STAT3, which are involved in cancer progression and immune response regulation (Zhang2020Oroxylin; Zhao2021FBXO15). Additionally, FBXO15 has been implicated in genetic studies related to neuropsychiatric conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Pan2022OGDHL; O’Donnell2010Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO15 has been implicated in various genetic studies related to autism and depression. In the context of autism, a study found that individuals with deletions on chromosome 18q, including the FBXO15 gene, exhibited an increased risk of autistic behaviors. This risk was particularly noted when FBXO15 hemizygosity was combined with deletions in other genes like TCF4 and NETO1, suggesting a multifactorial genetic influence on autism (O’Donnell2010Genetic).

In the realm of depressive disorders, a variant of FBXO15, rs79499419, was identified as having a potential association with familial depressive disorder. This variant was found through whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, which suggested it might have high penetrance for depression. However, the specific role of FBXO15 in depression remains less clear, as it was not prioritized in functional investigations of depressive disorders (Pan2022OGDHL).

Overall, while FBXO15 is associated with certain neuropsychiatric conditions, its precise clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it influences these disorders require further investigation.

## Interactions
FBXO15 is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In breast cancer, FBXO15 interacts with the protein SOX2, affecting its stability and ubiquitination. This interaction leads to decreased SOX2 protein stability and increased ubiquitination, which is crucial for the regulation of the EGFR signaling pathway, a key player in cancer progression. FBXO15 also interacts with STAT3, regulating its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby influencing EGFR expression and activation through the regulation of SOX2 stabilization (Zhao2021FBXO15).

In the context of sepsis, FBXO15 interacts with the protein CHOP. This interaction is facilitated by the SCF complex, where FBXO15 mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CHOP. The degradation of CHOP by FBXO15 is essential for the efficacy of oroxylin A, a compound that alleviates immunoparalysis in sepsis models. The interaction between FBXO15 and CHOP was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting the role of FBXO15 in regulating inflammation by modulating CHOP levels (Zhang2020Oroxylin). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of FBXO15 in both cancer and immune response regulation.
