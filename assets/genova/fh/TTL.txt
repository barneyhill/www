# TTL

## Overview
The TTL gene encodes the enzyme tubulin tyrosine ligase, which is a critical player in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically in the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle. This enzyme is categorized as a ligase due to its role in catalyzing the addition of a tyrosine residue to the C-terminal end of detyrosinated α-tubulin, thereby forming tyrosinated microtubules. These microtubules are essential for maintaining the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton, which are crucial for cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and neuronal differentiation (Kato2004Low; Moutin2020Tubulin). The TTL gene's expression and the activity of its encoded enzyme have significant implications in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where alterations in TTL expression can influence disease progression and prognosis (Kato2004Low; Müller2021TTLExpression).

## Structure
Tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) is an enzyme characterized by a two-domain structure. The enzyme consists of a 40-kilodalton (kD) protein that can be cleaved into two distinct fragments: a 30-kD fragment and a 14-kD fragment. The 30-kD fragment contains the ATP-binding site and the beta-tubulin-binding site, indicating its role in the enzyme's catalytic activity. This fragment is recognized by the LA/C4 antibody. The 14-kD fragment, recognized by the ID3 antibody, does not contain these binding sites and may have a different functional role (Wehland1987Tubulintyrosine).

The tertiary structure of TTL has been studied through crystallization and X-ray diffraction, revealing a model consisting of 308 residues, two magnesium ions, and 36 water molecules. Some regions of the polypeptide chain are presumed disordered. The structure includes an extended cavity in the catalytic pocket, which allows TTL to accommodate various substrates, including larger and structurally different amino acids from its natural substrate, tyrosine (Schumacher2017Broad; Szyk2011Tubulin).

TTL is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 daltons, behaving as a globular protein with a single polypeptide chain (Schröder1985Purification).

## Function
Tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of α-tubulin, specifically in the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle. This cycle is essential for maintaining the dynamic properties of microtubules, which are crucial for various cellular functions such as intracellular transport, cell division, and neuronal differentiation (Kato2004Low; Moutin2020Tubulin). TTL catalyzes the addition of a tyrosine residue to the C-terminal end of detyrosinated α-tubulin, forming tyrosinated microtubules. These tyrosinated microtubules are associated with dynamic microtubule networks, particularly in neuronal growth cones, and are sensitive to depolymerizing agents (Moutin2020Tubulin).

In healthy human cells, TTL is involved in neuronal development and function. It is crucial for proper neuronal morphogenesis and polarization, as evidenced by the altered phenotypes observed in neurons lacking TTL (Moutin2020Tubulin). The enzyme is also implicated in axonal regeneration, where it increases the levels of tyrosinated α-tubulin at injury sites, promoting recovery and retrograde transport essential for neuron survival (Moutin2020Tubulin). TTL's activity is regulated by its interaction with microtubule-associated proteins, such as MAP1B, which enhances its function in microtubule tyrosination (Utreras2007MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TTL gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, low TTL expression is associated with increased levels of detyrosinated tubulin, which correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. This is observed in various cancer types, where reduced TTL levels promote tumor growth and negatively impact patient outcomes (Müller2021TTLExpression). Conversely, high TTL expression is linked to favorable cancer prognoses, suggesting its potential role as a therapeutic target.

In neuroblastomas, a type of cancer common in children, low expression of the human tubulin tyrosine ligase (hTTL) gene is associated with poor prognosis. This is due to the suppression of the tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, which is crucial for neuronal differentiation. Low hTTL expression is linked to MYCN amplification, a marker of aggressive neuroblastomas, and is associated with impaired neuronal differentiation and enhanced tumor growth (Kato2004Low).

Alterations in TTL expression also affect epithelial cell morphology, impacting organ functionality. For instance, diminished enterocyte height in the intestines is observed in conditions like coeliac disease and chemotherapy patients, affecting intestinal absorption (Müller2021TTLExpression).

## Interactions
Tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) interacts with several proteins, primarily involving its role in the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle of tubulin. TTL forms a stable complex with tubulin, specifically binding to beta-tubulin. This interaction is facilitated by a 30-kD domain of TTL that carries the binding sites for beta-tubulin and ATP, while a separate 14-kD domain may form part of the catalytic site (Wehland1987Tubulintyrosine). The binding site on beta-tubulin is distinct from the enzymatic action site on the carboxyl end of alpha-tubulin, allowing TTL to form a complex with tubulin even when the carboxyl-terminal domains are removed (Wehland1987Tubulintyrosine).

TTL also interacts with microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. This interaction is specific, as TTL does not bind to other microtubule-associated proteins like doublecortin. The interaction with MAP1B enhances TTL activity, contributing to the control of microtubule tyrosination (Utreras2007MicrotubuleAssociated). TTL's activity is also regulated by phosphorylation through protein kinase C and can be influenced by the cytoskeleton regulator stathmin (Moutin2020Tubulin).
