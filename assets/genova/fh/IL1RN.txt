# IL1RN

## Overview
The IL1RN gene encodes the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a critical protein involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. IL-1Ra functions as a competitive inhibitor of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by binding to IL-1 receptors without triggering signal transduction, thereby preventing the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (Witkin2002Influence; Arend1991Interleukin). This protein is categorized as a cytokine antagonist and exists in multiple isoforms, including a secreted form and several intracellular forms, which are produced through alternative splicing (Arend2000Biological; Arend1998INTERLEUKIN1). The IL1RN gene is expressed in various tissues and is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, playing a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis and protecting against excessive inflammation (Gabay1997Interleukin; Arend1998INTERLEUKIN1). Mutations in IL1RN can lead to autoinflammatory conditions, underscoring its importance in immune regulation (Aksentijevich2009An; Urbaneja2024Case).

## Structure
The IL1RN gene encodes the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a protein that plays a crucial role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses. IL-1Ra exists in several isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a secreted form (sIL-1Ra) and multiple intracellular forms (icIL-1Ra1, icIL-1Ra2, and icIL-1Ra3) (Arend2000Biological; Arend1998INTERLEUKIN1). The secreted isoform is a 177 amino acid protein that is secreted as a 152 amino acid protein after cleavage of a 25 amino acid leader sequence (Arend1998INTERLEUKIN1).

The secondary structure of IL-1Ra includes 12 β-strands and 3-10 α-helices, forming a β-trefoil structure, which is a common motif in the IL-1 family (Pillai2024Alterations; Nicklin2002A). This structure is characterized by a single domain of 12 packed β-sheets, allowing for extensive diversification of the coding sequences (Nicklin2002A). The tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds at key binding sites, such as W16, Q20, Y34, Q36, and Y147, which are essential for binding affinity to the IL-1 receptor (Pillai2024Alterations).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are noted in the secreted isoform, which is secreted as variably glycosylated species of 22-25 kDa (Arend2000Biological). The intracellular isoforms differ in their binding characteristics and biological activities, with icIL-1Ra3 binding less avidly to IL-1 receptors (Arend2000Biological).

## Function
The IL1RN gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a protein that plays a critical role in modulating the immune response by inhibiting the activities of interleukin 1 (IL-1). IL-1Ra functions as a competitive inhibitor by binding to IL-1 receptors without initiating signal transduction, thereby preventing IL-1 from activating pro-inflammatory pathways (Witkin2002Influence; Arend1991Interleukin). This regulation is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation, which could lead to tissue damage (Arend1998INTERLEUKIN1).

IL-1Ra exists in multiple isoforms, including a glycosylated soluble form (sIL-1Ra) and two intracellular non-glycosylated forms (icIL-1Ra I and II), which are generated through alternative splicing and regulated by distinct promoters (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1). The soluble form is secreted into the extracellular environment, while the intracellular forms remain within the cell, suggesting distinct roles in regulating IL-1 activity both inside and outside the cell (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1).

In healthy human cells, IL-1Ra is produced by various tissues, including epithelial cells and hepatocytes, and is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli (Gabay1997Interleukin; Arend1998INTERLEUKIN1). It acts as an acute-phase protein, with its levels increasing during inflammation to protect the organism from exaggerated inflammatory responses (Gabay1997Interleukin). This protective role is crucial in preventing chronic inflammation and associated tissue damage (Witkin2002Influence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL1RN gene, which encodes the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), are associated with a rare autoinflammatory condition known as Deficiency of the Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by systemic inflammation due to unopposed interleukin-1 signaling, leading to symptoms such as multifocal osteomyelitis, periostitis, and pustulosis, often beginning at birth (Jesus2011A; Aksentijevich2009An). Patients with DIRA typically exhibit mutations that result in a nonfunctional IL-1Ra protein, which fails to inhibit the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β, causing excessive inflammatory responses (Urbaneja2024Case; Ziaee2020Homozygous).

DIRA can be caused by various mutations, including homozygous truncating mutations, compound heterozygous mutations, and genomic deletions within the IL1RN gene (Urbaneja2024Case; Sözeri2018A). These genetic alterations lead to decreased mRNA production and truncated proteins, resulting in a loss of function (Urbaneja2024Case). Treatment with anakinra, a recombinant form of IL-1Ra, has shown rapid clinical improvement in patients, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting IL-1 signaling in this condition (Aksentijevich2009An).

## Interactions
The interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) protein primarily interacts with the interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) to inhibit the binding of interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby modulating immune and inflammatory responses (Pillai2024Alterations). Key amino acids in IL1RN, such as W16, Q20, Y34, Q36, and Y147, are crucial for its binding affinity to IL-1R1. These amino acids engage in various interactions: W16 forms hydrophobic interactions, Q20 and Y34 form hydrogen bonds with the receptor's main chain, Q36 stabilizes the interaction through three hydrogen bonds, and Y147 interacts with water molecules to form a hydrogen bond with IL-1R1 (Pillai2024Alterations).

Mutations in the IL1RN gene can lead to alterations in these interactions, affecting the protein's ability to bind IL-1R1 effectively. For example, certain nonsense and frameshift mutations result in the loss of critical secondary structures and binding sites, leading to diminished or absent protein expression and function (Pillai2024Alterations). The IL1RN protein does not have documented interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond IL-1R1 in the provided context.
