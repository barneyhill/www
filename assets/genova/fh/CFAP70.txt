# CFAP70

## Overview
The CFAP70 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 70, which is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the axoneme, particularly within the central apparatus of mammalian sperm. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in forming a homodimer that interacts with other axonemal components, such as CFAP65, to facilitate the central apparatus-radial spoke (CA-RS) interaction. This interaction is vital for the stability and function of the axoneme, which is essential for cellular motility and sensory functions. The CFAP70 protein is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in ciliary and flagellar function, with implications for processes such as sperm motility and potentially other ciliary functions in humans (Zhao2019Proteome; Zhu2024Incell).

## Function
CFAP70 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural assembly and function of the central apparatus (CA) in the axoneme of mammalian sperm, particularly in the C2 microtubule projection. It forms a homodimer located on top of CFAP65 and is involved in the CA-RS (central apparatus-radial spoke) interaction, which is essential for the stability and function of the axoneme (Zhu2024Incell). CFAP70 is predicted to be associated with the C2 microtubule, and its presence is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the axoneme, as evidenced by studies in Chlamydomonas, where mutations in the homologous FAP70 protein did not cause structural defects in the outer doublet microtubules but did result in extra density at the base of the outer dynein arm (Zhao2019Proteome).

In humans, CFAP70 is conserved and is thought to be involved in similar structural roles within the axoneme, contributing to the proper assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella. This function is critical for cellular motility and sensory functions, impacting processes such as sperm motility and potentially other ciliary functions in the body (Zhao2019Proteome).
