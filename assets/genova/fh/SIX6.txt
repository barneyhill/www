# SIX6

## Overview
SIX6 is a gene that encodes the SIX homeobox 6 protein, a member of the Six family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its role as a transcription factor, primarily involved in the development of the eye and brain. The SIX6 protein contains two conserved domains, the Six domain and the Six-type homeodomain, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities and interactions with other proteins such as Eya and DACH (Kawakami2000Six). Functionally, SIX6 is crucial for the regulation of genes necessary for retinal and hypothalamic development, influencing processes like cell differentiation and proliferation (Larder2011Hypothalamic). Clinically, mutations in the SIX6 gene have been linked to ocular conditions such as primary open-angle glaucoma and developmental abnormalities like anophthalmia and microphthalmia, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Ulmer2014Discovery; Deepthi2020SIX6related).

## Structure
The SIX6 protein is a member of the Six family of transcription factors, characterized by the presence of two conserved domains: the Six domain (SD) and the Six-type homeodomain (HD). These domains are crucial for specific DNA binding and interactions with Eya proteins (Kawakami2000Six). The HD of Six proteins, including SIX6, is unique because it lacks two highly conserved amino acid residues typical of most homeodomains, which may affect specific DNA binding (Kawakami2000Six). The Six3/6 subfamily, which includes SIX6, has a perfectly conserved HD between mouse Six3 and human SIX3 (Kawakami2000Six).

The molecular structure of SIX6 is essential for its function as a transcription factor, particularly in the development of the forebrain and eyes (Kawakami2000Six). While the specific tertiary and quaternary structures of SIX6 are not detailed in the available context, the protein's role in transcriptional regulation suggests it may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and stability. Splice variants of SIX6 may result in different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
SIX6 (SIX homeobox 6) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the development of the eye and brain. In healthy human cells, SIX6 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for the proper development and function of the retina and hypothalamus. It is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences cell differentiation and proliferation, impacting visual and neurological functions (Larder2011Hypothalamic).

SIX6 is part of the SIX family of homeobox genes, which are known to act as transcriptional activators or repressors. This gene is crucial for the correct targeting and expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in neurons, which is essential for reproductive function. In mice, the absence of SIX6 leads to a significant decrease in fertility due to disrupted regulation of GnRH expression, highlighting its importance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Larder2011Hypothalamic).

SIX6's role extends beyond eye development, as it is involved in broader developmental processes, including the regulation of molecular pathways such as mTOR, KRAS, and TNFα, although these pathways are more prominently studied in pathological contexts like T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Laukkanen2020SIX6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIX6 gene are associated with several ocular conditions, most notably primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness. Variants in the SIX6 gene, such as the missense mutation rs33912345, have been linked to POAG and are associated with the thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, a characteristic feature of glaucoma (Lu2019Association; Ulmer2014Discovery). The Asn141His variant in SIX6 is significantly associated with POAG and is linked to a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer in patients homozygous for the risk allele, suggesting that these variants may disrupt neural retina development and increase the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss (Ulmer2014Discovery).

SIX6 is also implicated in other ocular abnormalities, such as anophthalmia and microphthalmia. A homozygous deletion in the SIX6 gene has been reported in a consanguineous Syrian family, leading to severe ocular malformations, including anophthalmia and microphthalmia, along with other developmental issues (Deepthi2020SIX6related). These findings underscore the critical role of SIX6 in eye development and its association with various ocular pathologies.

## Interactions
SIX6, a member of the SIX homeodomain protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in development. SIX6 interacts with EYA and DACH proteins, forming complexes that regulate transcription by either activating or repressing target genes. These interactions are context-dependent and play a significant role in processes such as pituitary development and eye formation (Kelberman2009Genetic).

In addition to its interactions with EYA and DACH, SIX6 also interacts with GEMININ, a cell cycle regulator. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal region of SIX6, which is essential for binding to GEMININ. The interaction between SIX6 and GEMININ has been studied using techniques like bimolecular fluorescence complementation, revealing that the C-terminal regions of both proteins are crucial for their binding (Turcu2019SIX3).

SIX6 also participates in interactions with Groucho-related co-repressors, such as Grg proteins. These interactions enhance the transcriptional repression capabilities of SIX6, which are important for its function in developmental processes like eye and forebrain development (Zhu2002Six3mediated).
