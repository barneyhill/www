# PRPF4

## Overview
The PRPF4 gene encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 4, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the splicing of pre-mRNA by being a component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex within the spliceosome. This protein is essential for the accurate removal of introns and the joining of exons, processes that are critical for the maturation of nearly all human mRNAs (Chen2014PRPF4; Linder2014Identification). The PRPF4 protein is characterized by a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for spliceosome assembly and function (Chen2014PRPF4). Mutations in PRPF4 have been linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2014PRPF4; Linder2014Identification). Additionally, PRPF4 has been implicated in cancer biology, influencing cell growth and apoptosis, which suggests its potential as a therapeutic target (Park2019PRPF4).

## Structure
The PRPF4 protein is a component of the spliceosome complex, involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It consists of 522 amino acids and includes a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions within the spliceosome (Chen2014PRPF4). The WD40 domain is characterized by a propeller structure with multiple blades, and mutations within this domain, such as p.Pro315Leu, have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa (Chen2014PRPF4).

The N-terminal region of PRPF4, encompassing residues 1-169, is intrinsically disordered and does not undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to PPIH, another spliceosomal protein (Rajiv2017The). This region contains two interaction sites with PPIH: a high-affinity site within residues 106-169 and a lower-affinity site within residues 1-98 (Rajiv2017The). The intrinsically disordered nature of this region is supported by circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses, which indicate a predominantly coil structure with some alpha-helix propensity (Rajiv2017The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, are suggested to regulate PRPF4's interactions, particularly in its N-terminal region, which is rich in arginine, lysine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Rajiv2017The). These modifications may influence the protein's ability to bind PPIH and other spliceosomal components.

## Function
The PRPF4 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex within the spliceosome, a molecular machine essential for pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. This process is vital for the maturation of nearly all human mRNAs, as it involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons to produce functional mRNA molecules (Linder2014Identification; Chen2014PRPF4). PRPF4 interacts with other proteins, such as PRPF3 and cyclophilin PPIH, to form a stable complex that is crucial for the assembly and stability of the spliceosome (Chen2014PRPF4; Rajiv2017The). 

In healthy human cells, PRPF4 ensures accurate and efficient splicing of pre-mRNA by maintaining the integrity of the spliceosomal complex. It plays a role in regulating the stability of the U4/U6 di-snRNP, which is necessary for continuous splicing activity (Chen2014PRPF4). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and cellular function (Rajiv2017The). Disruptions in PRPF4 function can lead to diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its importance in normal cellular processes (Linder2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPF4 gene are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors. Specific mutations, such as p.Pro315Leu and c.-114_-97del, have been identified as contributing to this condition. The p.Pro315Leu mutation leads to defects in non-snRNP factors and results in a dominant-negative effect, where the mutant protein counteracts the wild-type protein, disrupting normal splicing processes. This mutation also causes systemic deformations and retinal phenotypes in zebrafish models, indicating its pathogenic role in retinal degeneration (Chen2014PRPF4).

The c.-114_-97del mutation, an 18 bp deletion in the promoter region, reduces PRPF4 expression by eliminating transcription factor binding sites, leading to haploinsufficiency. This loss-of-function mechanism is linked to decreased expression of PRPF4, which is insufficient for proper splicing, contributing to the development of retinitis pigmentosa (Chen2014PRPF4).

In breast cancer, PRPF4 influences cell growth, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Knockdown of PRPF4 in breast cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Park2019PRPF4).

## Interactions
PRPF4 is a component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate spliceosome assembly and function. PRPF4 forms a stable complex with PRPF3 and the cyclophilin PPIH, acting as a bridging factor within the spliceosome. The p.R192H mutation in PRPF4 disrupts its binding to PRPF3, impairing its integration into spliceosomal particles, while its interaction with PPIH remains unaffected (Linder2014Identification).

PRPF4 also interacts with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) such as U4 and U6, which are essential for the stability and function of the tri-snRNP complex. The p.R192H variant leads to reduced co-precipitation with these snRNAs, indicating a defect in snRNP integration (Linder2014Identification).

The interaction between PRPF4 and PPIH involves two distinct binding sites within the N-terminal region of PRPF4. These sites exhibit different affinities, with the high-affinity site located in residues 106-169. This bipartite interaction is crucial for the stability and specificity of the PRPF4:PPIH complex, contributing to the proper functioning of the spliceosomal machinery (Rajiv2017The).
