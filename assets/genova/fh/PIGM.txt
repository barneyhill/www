# PIGM

## Overview
The PIGM gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class M, which is a crucial component in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for the attachment of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) to the cell membrane, influencing a variety of cellular processes, including enzymatic activity, antigen presentation, and immune responses (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The PIGM protein, categorized as a mannosyltransferase, is characterized by its transmembrane structure, featuring 10 transmembrane α-helices and a critical sugar-binding motif, DXD, necessary for its enzymatic function (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The gene is ubiquitously expressed across major human tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular function and human health (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). Mutations in PIGM are linked to various clinical conditions, including GPI biosynthesis defects and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Wu2020The; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

## Structure
The PIGM protein is encoded by the PIGM gene located on chromosome 1q23 and consists of 423 amino acids (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The protein's structure, as predicted by AlphaFold DB, includes 10 transmembrane α-helices that alternate with 11 lumenal and cytoplasmic domains (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). A notable feature of the PIGM protein is the sugar-binding motif, aspartate-any residue-aspartate (DXD), located at amino acid positions 49-51. This motif is essential for coordinating a manganese ion necessary for binding to a nucleotide sugar substrate (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). Mutations in this motif, such as D51A, lead to the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface, underscoring its critical role (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

The protein does not have any predicted phosphorylation sites, and its catalytic activity is thought to be regulated by binding to PIGX, which stabilizes the enzyme (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The lumenal domains are expected to exert catalytic activity, although their functional importance has not been experimentally confirmed (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

## Function
The PIGM gene encodes the enzyme GPI-mannosyltransferase I (GPI-ManT-I), which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for attaching GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) to the cell membrane, impacting various cellular processes such as enzymatic activity, antigen presentation, co-receptor engagement, adhesion, and immune responses (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGM is responsible for the transfer of the first mannose to the GPI core structure, a critical step in GPI biosynthesis that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (Liu2021A; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

The enzyme consists of 423 amino acids and features a sugar-binding motif, DXD, which is crucial for binding to a nucleotide sugar substrate. This motif is essential for the expression of GPI-APs on the cell surface, as mutations in this motif can lead to the absence of GPI-APs (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGM's activity is vital for the proper localization and function of GPI-APs, which are involved in various cellular functions, including intracellular trafficking and signal transduction (Liu2021A). The gene is expressed in all major human tissues, indicating its widespread role in human health (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGM gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis. A notable mutation in PIGM is a hypomorphic promoter mutation, 270 C→G, which disrupts the binding of the transcription factor Sp1. This leads to decreased PIGM mRNA levels and impaired GPI mannosylation, resulting in conditions such as venous thrombosis and seizures (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGM mutations are also linked to GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBD1), characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. The median age of seizure onset in affected individuals is 3.75 years, with a median age at death of 5.5 years (Wu2020The).

PIGM mutations have been implicated in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare hematological disorder marked by intravascular hemolysis and thrombosis (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). Additionally, PIGM expression is upregulated in various cancers, including lung, glioma, skin, liver, and thyroid cancers, and is associated with patient survival outcomes. High PIGM expression in myeloma is linked to adverse survival outcomes, highlighting its potential impact on cancer progression (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). These findings underscore the critical role of PIGM in health conditions such as thrombosis, seizures, and cancer.

## Interactions
PIGM, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, interacts with several proteins to facilitate its function. It forms a complex with PIGX, which acts as a regulatory subunit, to catalyze the transfer of the first mannose to the GPI intermediate. This interaction is crucial for the proper expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface (Liu2021A; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The knockout of PIGM results in the complete absence of GPI-APs, highlighting its essential role in GPI biosynthesis (Liu2021A; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

PIGM is also reported to interact with 39 proteins, including glycoproteins and G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as proteins from SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a potential role in viral life cycles. However, the specific biological context of these interactions remains unclear (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The interaction between PIGM and PIGX is suggested to stabilize PIGM, as defective PIGX leads to phenotypes similar to PIGM deficiency (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). These interactions underscore the complex role of PIGM in cellular processes and its potential implications in health and disease.
