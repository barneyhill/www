# CLIP1

## Overview
The CLIP1 gene encodes the CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 1, commonly referred to as CLIP-170, which is a microtubule-associated protein integral to cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and neuronal development. CLIP-170 is characterized by its CAP-Gly domains, coiled-coil domain, and zinc knuckle domains, which facilitate its binding to microtubules and interaction with other proteins (Mishima2007Structural; Chen2019Mapping). Functioning primarily at the plus ends of microtubules, CLIP-170 acts as a microtubule rescue factor, stabilizing microtubules and promoting their growth, which is essential for proper chromosome alignment during mitosis and maintaining dendritic structure in neurons (Tanenbaum2005CLIP170; Larti2014A). The protein's interactions with the dynein/dynactin complex and IQGAP1 underscore its role in linking microtubules to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cell migration and neuronal morphology (Akhmanova2005The; Larti2014A). Alterations in the CLIP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including intellectual disability and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Izumi2021The; Larti2014A).

## Structure
The CLIP1 gene encodes the cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP-170), which plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics. The protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region contains two CAP-Gly domains, CAP-Gly-1 and CAP-Gly-2, which are essential for binding to microtubules and the EEY motif of the EB1 protein (Mishima2007Structural; Chen2019Mapping). These domains have positively charged grooves that interact with the acidic tails of α-tubulin, facilitating microtubule binding (Mishima2007Structural).

The central region of CLIP-170 features a coiled-coil domain that mediates dimerization, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Chen2019Mapping). The C-terminal region contains zinc knuckle domains, which are involved in autoinhibition by interacting with the N-terminal CAP-Gly domains (Mishima2007Structural). These zinc knuckles also play a role in recruiting dynein to the microtubule plus end (Mishima2007Structural).

CLIP-170 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Chen2019Mapping). The protein also contains SxIP-like motifs that enhance its binding to EB1, contributing to its multivalent interactions (Chen2019Mapping).

## Function
The CLIP1 gene encodes the CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 1, also known as CLIP-170, which is a microtubule-associated protein involved in several critical cellular processes. CLIP-170 is primarily active at the plus ends of microtubules, where it functions as a microtubule rescue factor, stabilizing microtubules and facilitating their growth. This stabilization is crucial for various cellular activities, including intracellular transport and cell division (Tanenbaum2005CLIP170; Larti2014A).

During mitosis, CLIP-170 plays a vital role in the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which are essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. It localizes to the outermost part of unattached kinetochores, acting as a linker between kinetochores and microtubules, ensuring efficient chromosome congression (Tanenbaum2005CLIP170).

In neurons, CLIP-170, in conjunction with IQGAP1, regulates dendrite morphology by controlling the interaction between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper dendritic structure and function, impacting neuronal development and polarization (Neukirchen2011Cytoplasmic; Larti2014A). CLIP-170's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function across different cell types.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLIP1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A homozygous nonsense mutation in the CLIP1 gene has been identified as a genetic cause of autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID) in an Iranian family. This mutation leads to a premature termination codon, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay and a significant reduction in CLIP1 transcript levels. The absence of functional CLIP1 protein affects microtubule dynamics and is associated with cognitive impairments, as well as complete spermatogenic hypoplasia in a male patient, indicating a role in human spermatogenesis (Larti2014A).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the CLIP1 gene is involved in the formation of the CLIP1-LTK fusion protein, which acts as an oncogenic driver. This fusion results in constitutive activation of kinase activity, promoting oncogenic transformation. The CLIP1-LTK fusion is a potential therapeutic target, as it can be inhibited by lorlatinib, leading to tumor shrinkage in patients (Izumi2021The).

In gastric cancer, a novel truncated variant of CLIP1, known as CLIP-170S, is associated with taxane resistance. This variant obstructs the microtubule pore, preventing effective drug binding and contributing to drug resistance (Kita2019Imatinib).

## Interactions
The CLIP1 gene encodes the CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 1, also known as CLIP-170, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for microtubule dynamics. CLIP1 interacts with the dynein/dynactin complex, particularly binding to the dynactin subunit DCTN1 (p150 Glued), which is essential for linking unattached kinetochores to microtubule plus ends during mitosis (Akhmanova2005The; Larti2014A). The N-terminal region of CLIP1 interacts with EB1 and alpha-tubulin, facilitating its localization on microtubule plus ends (Dixit2009Microtubule; Larti2014A). 

CLIP1 also forms a complex with IQGAP1, linking the actin cytoskeleton to microtubules during cell migration and regulating dendrite morphology in neurons (Akhmanova2005The; Larti2014A). Additionally, CLIP1 binds to PAFAH1B1 (LIS1), a regulator of dynein function, which is important for neuron migration and vesicle transport (Akhmanova2005The; Larti2014A). These interactions highlight CLIP1's role in intracellular transport and cellular structure maintenance. The absence of CLIP1 disrupts its interactions with IQGAP1 and the dynein/dynactin complex, potentially affecting dendrite morphology and axoplasmic transport (Larti2014A).
