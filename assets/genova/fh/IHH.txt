# IHH

## Overview
The IHH gene encodes the Indian Hedgehog (IHH) protein, a key signaling molecule within the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is integral to various developmental processes, particularly in bone growth and homeostasis. As a signaling protein, IHH is categorized as a morphogen, influencing cell fate and patterning during embryonic development. It is primarily involved in endochondral ossification, a critical process for the formation of long bones and the vertebral column. The IHH protein interacts with several cellular components, including cell adhesion molecules and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, to mediate its effects. Mutations in the IHH gene are linked to skeletal disorders such as brachydactyly type A1 and acrocapitofemoral dysplasia, underscoring its essential role in normal skeletal development and function (SentchordiMontané2020Clinical; Ohba2020Hedgehog; Yang2015The).

## Structure
The Indian Hedgehog (IHH) protein is a signaling molecule involved in various developmental processes. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure of IHH includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall shape and function. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which help maintain the protein's three-dimensional conformation. IHH may also form a quaternary structure through dimerization, which is essential for its signaling activity.

The protein contains a Hedgehog signaling domain, which is crucial for its role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This domain is involved in the interaction with other proteins and cellular components, facilitating the transmission of signals that regulate developmental processes. IHH undergoes post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation and cholesterol modification, which are important for its activity and localization within the cell.

Splice variant isoforms of IHH may exist, potentially affecting its function and localization. These variants can lead to differences in the protein's structure and its interaction with other molecules, thereby influencing its role in signaling pathways. However, specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The IHH gene encodes the Indian Hedgehog protein, a critical component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays a vital role in bone development and homeostasis. In healthy human cells, IHH is primarily involved in endochondral ossification, a process essential for the formation of long bones and the vertebral column. It is expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and regulates the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes, which are crucial for cartilage development and bone growth (StJacques1999Indian; Yang2015The).

IHH forms a feedback loop with parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) to control chondrocyte maturation. This loop ensures a balance between chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, maintaining the growth plate's length and facilitating normal skeletal development (Ohba2020Hedgehog; Vortkamp1996Regulation). IHH also influences osteoblast differentiation in the perichondrium, promoting bone formation (Yang2015The).

In addition to its role in bone development, IHH signaling is involved in maintaining bone homeostasis by regulating the balance between bone formation and resorption. It affects osteoclast activity through the expression of RANKL, which is critical for osteoclast differentiation (Yang2015The). IHH is also upregulated during fracture repair, indicating its role in bone healing processes (Yang2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IHH gene are associated with several skeletal disorders, most notably brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) and acrocapitofemoral dysplasia (ACFD). BDA1 is characterized by the hypoplasia or aplasia of the middle phalanges of the fingers and toes, often accompanied by short stature. This condition is typically caused by heterozygous mutations in the IHH gene, which affect the amino-terminal active fragment of the IHH protein, crucial for its interaction with receptor proteins like Ptc1 (SentchordiMontané2020Clinical; Kirkpatrick2003Identification; Byrnes2009Brachydactyly). 

ACFD is another condition linked to IHH mutations, presenting with short stature, brachydactyly, a narrow thorax, and specific femoral abnormalities. Unlike BDA1, the mutations causing ACFD are located in different regions of the IHH gene (Byrnes2009Brachydactyly). 

Additionally, IHH mutations can lead to hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), characterized by multiple cartilage-capped bony outgrowths and reduced skeletal size. This condition is associated with mutations in the Ext1/2 genes, which are crucial for proper IHH signal distribution (Sasai2019Hedgehog). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of IHH in skeletal development and its potential impact on growth and bone formation.

## Interactions
Indian hedgehog (IHH) interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its signaling functions. IHH forms calcium-dependent 1:1 complexes with cell adhesion molecules CDO and BOC, which are conserved across mammalian hedgehog proteins. These interactions involve hydrogen bonds between a negatively charged patch on the FNIII domain of CDO/BOC and a positive surface on the hedgehog proteins, including the calcium-binding site (Kavran2010All). The binding of IHH to CDO and BOC is weakened at low pH, suggesting a mechanism for the release of bound hedgehog proteins in acidic environments (Kavran2010All).

IHH also interacts with heparan sulfate (HS) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are important for the distribution and function of hedgehog proteins in embryonic development. These interactions are mediated by heparin-binding domains characterized by clusters of basic amino acids (Billings2015Interactions). Additionally, IHH binds to Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip), which acts as an inhibitor of hedgehog signaling. This interaction involves a b-propeller region on Hhip that coordinates with a zinc ion on the hedgehog protein (Beachy2010Interactions). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of IHH in cellular signaling pathways.
