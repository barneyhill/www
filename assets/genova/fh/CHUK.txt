# CHUK

## Overview
The CHUK gene encodes the IKKα protein, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for controlling immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. IKKα is a component of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which also includes IKKβ and NEMO, and is responsible for phosphorylating IκB proteins, leading to their degradation and subsequent activation of NF-κB transcription factors (Régnier1997Identification; Lahtela2010MutantCHUKand). Beyond its canonical role in NF-κB signaling, IKKα is involved in non-canonical pathways and has functions independent of its kinase activity, such as in epidermal development and chondrocyte differentiation (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK; Hu2001IKKα). Mutations in CHUK can lead to various clinical conditions, including immunodeficiencies and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in human health (Khandelwal2017Identification; Riller2024Compound).

## Structure
The CHUK gene encodes the protein IKKα, a serine/threonine kinase that is a component of the IKK complex involved in NF-κB signaling. The primary structure of IKKα includes an N-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain, a leucine zipper-like amphipathic α-helix, and a C-terminal helix-loop-helix domain (Régnier1997Identification; Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK). The secondary structure of IKKα features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK).

In terms of tertiary structure, IKKα folds these domains into a functional kinase, allowing it to interact with other proteins and perform its role in signaling pathways. The quaternary structure involves its interaction with other components of the IKK complex, such as IKKβ and NEMO, forming a signalosome complex that is crucial for NF-κB activation (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are essential for the activation of IKKα. These modifications enable IKKα to phosphorylate substrates like IκB proteins, leading to the activation of NF-κB (Régnier1997Identification). Splice variants of CHUK may exist, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK).

## Function
The CHUK gene encodes the IKKα protein, a critical component of the IKK complex involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. IKKα functions as a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates IκB proteins, leading to their degradation and the release of NF-κB transcription factors, which then translocate to the nucleus to activate target genes (Régnier1997Identification).

IKKα is involved in both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. In the non-canonical pathway, IKKα phosphorylates p100, facilitating the activation of NF-κB target genes that regulate immune responses and cellular differentiation (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK). Beyond its role in NF-κB signaling, IKKα is crucial for epidermal development and keratinocyte differentiation, acting independently of its kinase activity and NF-κB signaling (Vallabhapurapu2009Regulation; Hu2001IKKα).

IKKα also plays a role in extracellular matrix remodeling and chondrocyte differentiation, processes vital for cartilage formation and homeostasis. This function is independent of its kinase activity, as demonstrated by its ability to regulate matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHUK gene, which encodes the IKKα protein, are associated with a range of clinical conditions due to its role in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Compound heterozygous mutations in CHUK can lead to immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation, as seen in patients with features reminiscent of Hay-Wells syndrome, including ectodermal dysplasia, Pierre Robin sequence, and skeletal malformations. These mutations result in a severe loss of IKKα kinase activity, affecting both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, leading to hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and other immune abnormalities (Riller2024Compound).

Homozygous nonsense mutations in CHUK can cause fetal encasement syndrome, a lethal condition characterized by severe malformations, including craniofacial defects and limb abnormalities. This is due to a complete loss of CHUK protein expression, disrupting pathways critical for normal fetal development (Lahtela2010MutantCHUKand).

Heterozygous missense variants in CHUK have been linked to ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, such as EEC/AEC-like syndrome, which include skin, limb, and orofacial defects, along with immune deficiencies. These variants may have a dominant-negative effect, impairing kinase activity and affecting NF-κB activation (Khandelwal2017Identification).

## Interactions
CHUK, also known as IKKα, is involved in several protein interactions critical for its function in the NF-κB signaling pathway. It forms part of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which includes IKKβ and NEMO (IKKγ). This complex is essential for phosphorylating IκB proteins, leading to their degradation and the activation of NF-κB transcription factors (Lahtela2010MutantCHUKand). CHUK interacts with NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), a relationship confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and coimmunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells. This interaction enhances CHUK's ability to phosphorylate IκB-α, facilitating NF-κB activation (Régnier1997Identification).

CHUK also interacts with TRAF2, although it does not form a stable ternary complex with NIK and TRAF2, suggesting that such interactions may be transient (Régnier1997Identification). In the context of keratinocyte differentiation, CHUK interacts with Smad2 and Smad3, independent of its kinase activity, indicating a role beyond NF-κB signaling (Olivotto2013IKKαCHUK). These interactions highlight CHUK's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
