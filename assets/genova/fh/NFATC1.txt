# NFATC1

## Overview
The NFATC1 gene encodes the nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses, bone homeostasis, and skin stem cell maintenance. As a member of the NFAT family, the NFATC1 protein is characterized by its Rel similarity domain, which facilitates DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Serfling2006NFATc1). Unlike other Rel family members, NFATC1 functions as a monomer in solution and in complex with DNA (Chen1998Structure). The protein's activity is tightly regulated through post-translational modifications, particularly dephosphorylation by calcineurin, which is essential for its nuclear translocation and activation (Zhao2010NFATc1). NFATC1 is involved in various cellular processes, including T-cell activation, osteoclast differentiation, and the maintenance of quiescence in skin stem cells, highlighting its diverse functional roles in both normal physiology and disease states (Horsley2008NFATc1; Takayanagi2002Induction).

## Structure
The NFATC1 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a DNA-binding domain known as the Rel similarity domain (RSD), which is structurally similar to the DNA-binding domain of Rel/NF-kB factors (Serfling2006NFATc1). This domain consists of two immunoglobulin-like folds, with the N-terminal domain forming a β-sandwich structure and the C-terminal domain having an h-type immunoglobulin fold (Chen1998Structure). NFATC1 is a monomer in solution and in complex with DNA, unlike other Rel family members that typically dimerize (Chen1998Structure).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its regulation. Dephosphorylation by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin is necessary for NFATC1's nuclear translocation and activation (Zhao2010NFATc1). NFATC1 has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, with variations in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The NFATc1/αA isoform, for example, is characterized by a short C-terminal peptide and lacks a second transactivation/repressor domain found in longer isoforms (Serfling2012NFATc1/αA:). These structural features and modifications are essential for NFATC1's role in immune response regulation.

## Function
The NFATC1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the immune system and skin stem cell regulation. In T cells, NFATC1 is essential for activation and differentiation. It is strongly induced following T-cell receptor stimulation and is involved in the regulation of immune responses by modulating the expression of cytokines and other immune-related genes. NFATC1 interacts with AP1 proteins, such as Fos and Jun, to bind DNA and regulate gene transcription, which is critical for T-cell function (Serfling2006NFATc1).

In skin stem cells, NFATC1 is preferentially expressed in the quiescent niche of hair follicles, where it maintains stem cell quiescence by repressing CDK4 expression. This repression is mediated through BMP signaling and calcium signaling pathways. When NFATC1 activity is inhibited, stem cells exit quiescence and enter the cell cycle, leading to increased proliferation and hair growth (Horsley2008NFATc1).

NFATC1 also plays a significant role in osteoclast differentiation, where it is activated by RANKL signaling. It regulates the expression of genes necessary for osteoclast function, contributing to bone resorption and homeostasis (Takayanagi2002Induction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NFATC1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of congenital heart diseases, mutations in NFATC1 can impair its regulatory functions, leading to decreased transcriptional activity and disrupted interactions with other cardiac development genes such as GATA5 and HAND2. This disruption is linked to congenital heart diseases, particularly valve diseases (AbdulSater2012Two). NFATC1 is also implicated in atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), with specific missense mutations affecting cardiac development and leading to defects in the atrioventricular canal (Ferese2018Heterozygous).

In bone diseases, NFATC1 plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis. Its deficiency can lead to osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis, characterized by increased bone density and malformed bones (Aliprantis2008NFATc1). NFATC1 is also involved in cherubism, a pediatric disorder, where its activity is linked to enhanced osteoclastogenesis and systemic bone loss (Aliprantis2008NFATc1).

In osteoarthritis, NFATC1 acts as a suppressor. Its down-regulation is associated with the development of osteoarthritis, characterized by cartilage degradation and joint damage (Greenblatt2013NFATc1). Additionally, NFATC1 is involved in podocyte injury and albuminuria in kidney diseases, where its activation leads to altered cholesterol homeostasis and kidney damage (Pedigo2016Local).

## Interactions
NFATC1 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFATC1, facilitating its nuclear translocation and activation. This interaction is mediated through specific binding regions within NFATC1, such as the CNBR3 region, which is distinct from other known calcineurin-binding regions and selectively affects NFATc1's nuclear translocation and cytokine expression (Kitamura2020Identification).

NFATC1 also interacts with the NFκB signaling pathway, particularly with the p65 subunit of NFκB. This interaction is significant in cardiomyocytes, where NFATC1 and NFκB coordinate to regulate cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. The p65 subunit coimmunoprecipitates with NFATC1, and their interaction is facilitated by the Rel homology domain within p65. This interaction enhances NFAT transcriptional activity and is crucial for the synergistic activation of gene expression in cardiac cells (Liu2012Interaction).

Additionally, NFATC1's transcriptional activity is modulated by the MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which enhances NFAT activity through mechanisms independent of calcineurin. This pathway does not alter NFATC1's subcellular localization but increases its transcriptional activation, highlighting the complex regulatory network involving NFATC1 (Sanna2005Direct).
