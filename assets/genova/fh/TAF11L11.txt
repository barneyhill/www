# TAF11L11

## Overview
TAF11L11 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 11, which is involved in the regulation of gene transcription. This protein is part of the TFIID complex, a crucial component of the transcription preinitiation complex that facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase II to DNA, thereby initiating transcription. TAF11L11 is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in modulating the transcriptional activity of specific genes. The protein's function is essential for the precise control of gene expression, which is critical for various cellular processes and developmental pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
