# PPAT

## Overview
The PPAT gene encodes the enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, a critical component of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme, categorized as a transferase, catalyzes the conversion of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to 5-phosphoribosylamine, marking the first committed and rate-limiting step in purine metabolism. The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated through feedback inhibition by purine nucleotides and is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Structurally, PPAT exists in dynamic equilibrium between dimeric and tetrameric states, with its active form requiring an iron-sulfur cluster for functionality. The enzyme also plays a role in the formation of the purinosome, a multi-enzyme complex that enhances purine biosynthesis efficiency. Clinically, PPAT is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Pareek2020Human; Su2021Identification; Pedley2017A).

## Structure
The human gene PPAT encodes the enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, which plays a crucial role in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme's structure includes a glutaminase domain responsible for hydrolyzing glutamine to produce ammonia and a phosphoribosyl transferase domain where ammonia is added to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to produce 5-phosphoribosylamine (Pareek2020Human). The enzyme is inferred to have a structure similar to that of the bacterial Bacillus subtilis enzyme, suggesting that substrate binding to the first domain induces conformational changes that prime the second domain for PRPP binding (Pareek2020Human).

PPAT exists in a dynamic equilibrium between dimeric and tetrameric states, with the active tetrameric state subject to feedback inhibition by AMP (Pareek2020Human). The enzyme requires the cleavage of an N-terminal propeptide and the formation of an iron-sulfur cluster [4Fe-4S] for its active structure, which can be affected by oxidative stress (Pareek2020Human). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, also regulate PPAT activity, with Thr397 being a specific phosphorylation site linked to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Liu2019Mapping).

## Function
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to 5-phosphoribosylamine (PRA). This reaction is the first committed step in the pathway and is considered rate-limiting, making PPAT a key regulatory point in purine metabolism (Pedley2017A; Liu2019Mapping). The enzyme's activity is regulated through allosteric inhibition by downstream purine nucleotides, providing feedback control to maintain appropriate purine levels in cells (Pedley2017A).

PPAT is also involved in the formation of the purinosome, a macromolecular complex that enhances the efficiency of purine biosynthesis by organizing enzymes into a functional unit. This complex forms in response to cellular purine levels and metabolic demands, facilitating efficient metabolic flux and stability of reactive intermediates (Pedley2017A; Ayoub2024A). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell proliferation and growth by contributing to nucleotide synthesis, which is essential for DNA and RNA production (Ayoub2024A). The regulation of PPAT, including its interactions with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), is crucial for maintaining its stability and function in purine biosynthesis (Pedley2018Role).

## Clinical Significance
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in purine metabolism. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PPAT is significantly upregulated and associated with poorer prognosis. Its overexpression is linked to cancer cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that PPAT may drive cancer cells to switch to aerobic glycolysis, a process that supports rapid cell growth (Su2021Identification). The study by Su et al. highlights PPAT as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC, as silencing PPAT has been shown to repress cancer cell proliferation (Su2021Identification).

In thyroid cancer, PPAT is also highly expressed and associated with unfavorable prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by regulating pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and activating the ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Liu2020&lt; p&gt; Phosphoribosyl). High PPAT expression in thyroid cancer is correlated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node metastasis, and increased TNM stage, indicating its role in cancer progression (Liu2020&lt; p&gt; Phosphoribosyl).

Mutations in the PPAT gene can lead to disorders in purine nucleotide metabolism, such as hyperuricemia and gout, due to increased uric acid levels (Liu2020&lt; p&gt; Phosphoribosyl). These mutations are also associated with high microsatellite instability in gastric and colorectal cancers (Liu2020&lt; p&gt; Phosphoribosyl).

## Interactions
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) is a key enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway and participates in several important protein interactions. PPAT is a client protein of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is crucial for the formation of purinosomes, multienzyme assemblies that enhance purine production under high demand conditions. Inhibition of HSP90 disrupts its interaction with PPAT, leading to decreased stability and increased proteolytic degradation of PPAT (Pedley2018Role).

PPAT also forms part of the purinosome complex, a multi-protein assembly involved in purine biosynthesis. This complex is regulated by interactions with chaperones such as Hsp90 and Hsp70, and its formation is influenced by intracellular signaling pathways (Zhao2013The). The purinosome's assembly is reversible and responds to purine levels, with PPAT playing a central role in nucleating the complex (Zhao2013The).

Additionally, PPAT is subject to regulation by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by AKT kinase at Thr397. This modification is part of a regulatory mechanism that links the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to purine biosynthesis, potentially modulating PPAT activity in response to cellular conditions (Liu2019Mapping).
