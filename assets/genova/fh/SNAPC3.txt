# SNAPC3

## Overview
SNAPC3 is a gene that encodes the protein small nuclear RNA activating complex polypeptide 3, a critical component of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc). This protein plays a pivotal role in the transcription initiation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes by RNA polymerase II and III, which are essential for RNA processing and splicing. Structurally, the SNAPC3 protein is characterized by a saddle-shaped conformation with a central ubiquitin-like domain and zinc finger domains, facilitating its interaction with other SNAPc subunits and DNA. Functionally, SNAPC3 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, highlighting its importance in gene expression regulation and cellular function (Rengachari2022Structural; James2012Genomic). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including osteosarcoma and polycythemia vera, where alterations in SNAPC3 expression or structure may influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Kralovics2002Acquired; Liu2021Profiles).

## Structure
The SNAPC3 protein is a component of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc), which plays a crucial role in snRNA transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The molecular structure of SNAPC3 is characterized by a saddle-shaped conformation with a central 'ubiquitin-like domain' (ULD) and additional α-helices and β-strands (Rengachari2022Structural). It contains two zinc finger domains: ZF-1, a C2H2 type zinc finger, and ZF-2, a C4 type zinc finger. ZF-1 coordinates a Zn2+ ion with residues Cys221, His313, Cys317, and His319, while ZF-2 coordinates another Zn2+ ion with residues Cys354, Cys357, Cys380, and Cys383 (Rengachari2022Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, SNAPC3 interacts with other subunits of the SNAPc complex. Its N-terminal region primarily interacts with SNAPC1, while the C-terminal region binds to SNAPC4, forming a total of four subunit interfaces through hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges, and polar contacts (Rengachari2022Structural). SNAPC3 also plays a role in binding the proximal sequence element (PSE) in promoter DNA, inserting its helix α8 into the major groove and forming multiple contacts with DNA, including salt bridges and ionic interactions with specific nucleotide bases (Rengachari2022Structural).

## Function
SNAPC3 is a component of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc), which plays a crucial role in the transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes by RNA polymerase II and III. In healthy human cells, SNAPC3 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the synthesis of snRNA, which is essential for RNA processing and splicing (James2012Genomic). The SNAPc complex, including SNAPC3, is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular function (James2012Genomic).

SNAPC3, along with other SNAPc subunits, is involved in the transcription initiation of snRNA genes by binding to the proximal sequence element (PSE) of snRNA promoters. This binding is critical for recruiting RNA polymerases and other transcription factors necessary for efficient transcription initiation (James2012Genomic). The unique ability of SNAPc to be involved in transcription from both RNA polymerase II and III promoters highlights its versatile role in gene expression regulation (James2012Genomic). The presence of SNAPC3 in the SNAPc complex underscores its importance in the transcriptional regulation of snRNA genes, which are vital for the proper functioning of cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
SNAPC3 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in transcription regulation. In osteosarcoma, lower abundances of SNAPC3 are associated with higher disease-free survival probability, suggesting its potential clinical significance in the prognosis of this cancer (Liu2021Profiles). This indicates that SNAPC3 expression levels may influence cancer progression and patient outcomes.

In polycythemia vera, a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells, SNAPC3 is located within a region of chromosome 9p that frequently exhibits loss of heterozygosity (LOH) due to mitotic recombination. This LOH is a clonal stem cell lesion, suggesting that alterations in SNAPC3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease (Kralovics2002Acquired).

While a frameshift deletion mutation in SNAPC3 was identified in a healthy subject during a study on liver cancer-specific genetic variants, it was not found in the liver cancer patient, indicating that the clinical significance of SNAPC3 mutations in liver cancer remains unclear (Sultana2019A). Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of SNAPC3 mutations and expression alterations in various diseases.

## Interactions
SNAPC3 is a component of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc), which plays a crucial role in the transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. SNAPC3 interacts with other subunits of the SNAPc complex, including SNAPC1 and SNAPC4. These interactions are essential for the formation and stability of the SNAPc complex. SNAPC3 has a saddle-shaped structure with a central 'ubiquitin-like domain' and additional alpha-helices and beta-strands, which facilitate its interactions with SNAPC1 and SNAPC4. The N-terminal region of SNAPC3 primarily interacts with SNAPC1, while the C-terminal region binds to SNAPC4 (Rengachari2022Structural).

SNAPC3 also plays a role in binding to the proximal sequence element (PSE) of snRNA promoters. It interacts with the DNA backbone and bases, inserting its helix into the major groove of the DNA to form multiple contacts, including salt bridges and ionic interactions with specific nucleotide bases (Rengachari2022Structural). These interactions are crucial for the recognition and binding of the snRNA promoter by the SNAPc complex, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation (Sun2022Structural).
