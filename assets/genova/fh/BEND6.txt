# BEND6

## Overview
BEND6 is a gene that encodes the BEN domain containing 6 protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. The protein is characterized by the presence of a BEN domain, facilitating its role in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. BEND6 is predominantly expressed in the brain and functions as a nuclear inhibitor of the Notch signaling pathway, which is vital for neural development. By acting as a corepressor of the Notch transcription factor, BEND6 influences neural stem cell differentiation and self-renewal, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance between neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Fan2022The; Ma2021Identification; Khan2015BEND3).

## Structure


## Function
BEND6 (BEN domain containing 6) is a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. It contains a single BEN domain, which is known for mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in chromatin organization and gene expression (Ma2021Identification). BEND6 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it functions as a nuclear inhibitor of Notch signaling, a pathway crucial for neural development. By inhibiting Notch target genes, BEND6 influences neural stem cell differentiation and self-renewal, thereby impacting neural development and function (Fan2022The; Ma2021Identification).

BEND6 is most abundantly expressed in the brain, indicating its significant role in neural processes (Ma2021Identification). It acts as a corepressor of the Notch transcription factor, which is essential for maintaining the balance between neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Khan2015BEND3). Through its interactions with transcription-repressive complexes and chromatin remodeling factors, BEND6 contributes to the regulation of gene expression, highlighting its broader role in cellular and organismal biology (Ma2021Identification).
