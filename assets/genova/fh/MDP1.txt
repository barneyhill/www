# MDP1

## Overview
The MDP1 gene encodes the protein magnesium-dependent phosphatase 1, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This protein functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, playing a critical role in cellular regulation by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and closed-ring phosphosugars. MDP1 is characterized by its monomeric structure and a modified Rossmann fold, which includes a centrally located six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices. Unlike other HAD family members, MDP1 lacks a cap domain, resulting in an active site that is fully exposed to solvent, allowing for unique substrate interactions (Peisach2004Xray). The enzyme requires a Mg(II) cofactor for its activity, which is essential for stabilizing reaction intermediates and facilitating catalysis (Burroughs2006Evolutionary). MDP1's presence across eukaryotic organisms underscores its fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing metabolic pathways (Burroughs2006Evolutionary).

## Structure
The MDP1 protein, encoded by the human MDP1 gene, is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily and functions as a magnesium-dependent phosphatase. The primary structure of MDP1 includes a sequence of 164 amino acids, with 162 residues resolved in the final structural model (Peisach2004Xray). The secondary structure of MDP1 features a modified Rossmann fold, characterized by a centrally located six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices (Peisach2004Xray). 

In terms of tertiary structure, MDP1 is an elliptical monomer with a single domain. It lacks a cap domain, which is common in other HAD family members, resulting in an active site that is fully exposed to solvent (Peisach2004Xray). The active site is composed of four loops that coordinate a Mg(II) ion and bind phosphate analogs, with conserved aspartates and serines playing a crucial role in its phosphatase activity (Peisach2004Xray). 

MDP1 does not form oligomers, maintaining a monomeric quaternary structure in solution, as confirmed by gel filtration chromatography (Peisach2004Xray). The protein's structure supports its function as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, with conserved residues located on the surface outside the active site, suggesting a role in targeting phosphotyrosine in unknown proteins (Peisach2004Xray).

## Function
MDP1, or magnesium-dependent phosphatase 1, is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which is involved in dephosphorylation processes crucial for cellular regulation. This enzyme functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, capable of dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and closed-ring phosphosugars, suggesting its role in protein dephosphorylation processes within cells (Peisach2004Xray). MDP1 is characterized by a core catalytic domain with a Rossmannoid fold and requires a Mg(II) cofactor for its activity, which stabilizes reaction intermediates and facilitates catalysis (Burroughs2006Evolutionary).

The enzyme is monomeric and lacks a cap domain, which is typical in other HAD family members, resulting in an active site that is fully exposed to solvent. This structural feature allows MDP1 to anchor substrates through conserved residues at the active-site entrance, playing a role in substrate specificity and docking (Peisach2004Xray). MDP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences metabolic pathways and cellular homeostasis by removing phosphate groups from specific substrates, impacting cell growth, division, and response to environmental changes (Peisach2004Xray). The presence of MDP1 across eukaryotic organisms indicates its fundamental cellular function (Burroughs2006Evolutionary).
