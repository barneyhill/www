# SHMT2

## Overview
SHMT2, or serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in one-carbon metabolism, a critical biochemical pathway for cellular processes such as nucleotide synthesis and mitochondrial function. The protein product of SHMT2 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase due to its role in transferring one-carbon units. SHMT2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial translation and respiration, particularly under conditions of cellular proliferation and metabolic stress (Minton2018Serine; Walden2019Metabolic). The gene's expression and activity have significant implications in various clinical contexts, including developmental disorders and cancer, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (Wang2020Evaluating; GarcíaCazorla2020Impairment).

## Structure
SHMT2, or serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2, is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism. The enzyme is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent protein, which is essential for its catalytic activity. SHMT2 exists in two forms: an inactive dimer and an active tetramer, with the tetrameric form being stabilized by PLP (Walden2019Metabolic). The quaternary structure of SHMT2 is a homotetramer, which is common in eukaryotic organisms, including humans (Drago2023Revealing).

The enzyme's active site involves several key residues that interact with PLP, facilitating its role in catalysis. The binding of PLP is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and water-mediated interactions within the active site (Drago2023Revealing). The enzyme's structure also includes specific domains, such as the PLP binding domain, which is critical for its function.

SHMT2 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. The enzyme's structure and function are also influenced by its interaction with other proteins, such as the BRISC deubiquitylase complex, where the dimeric form of SHMT2 inhibits BRISC activity by sterically blocking its active site (Walden2019Metabolic).

## Function
SHMT2 (serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for various cellular processes. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, contributing to the one-carbon pool necessary for nucleotide synthesis and other biomolecular processes (Minton2018Serine). SHMT2 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in the context of mitochondrial translation initiation and the maintenance of formylmethionyl-tRNAs, which are necessary for the translation of mitochondrially encoded proteins (Minton2018Serine).

The enzyme supports cellular proliferation, especially under low-glucose conditions, by maintaining mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (Minton2018Serine). SHMT2 is involved in the synthesis of specific mtDNA-encoded proteins, such as cytochrome c oxidase I and II, and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1, which are crucial for the electron transport chain (Minton2018Serine). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in proliferative cells, where it helps harvest serine's carbon for mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, subsequently exporting these units to the cytoplasm for further reactions (Minton2018Serine). SHMT2's function is vital for maintaining mitochondrial translation and respiration, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Minton2018Serine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHMT2 gene have significant clinical implications. Mutations in SHMT2 have been linked to a novel brain and heart developmental syndrome characterized by dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial-septal defects, congenital microcephaly, and corpus callosum abnormalities. These mutations are located in conserved residues and are either absent or extremely rare in control databases, suggesting a recessive mode of inheritance. The mutations likely cause hypomorphic effects, impairing enzymatic function and leading to these developmental issues (GarcíaCazorla2020Impairment).

In cancer, SHMT2 is frequently overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. In kidney cancer, high SHMT2 expression correlates with worse overall survival and is linked to cancer progression (Wang2020Evaluating). Similarly, in bladder cancer, SHMT2 overexpression promotes tumor cell growth and is associated with poor overall survival, particularly in patients with high tumor grades (Zhang2021Overexpression). SHMT2 also plays a role in glioma cell survival under ischemic conditions by modulating metabolic pathways, which supports cancer cell survival in low-oxygen environments (Kim2015SHMT2). In fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, SHMT2 amplification contributes to tumorigenesis and affects drug sensitivity (Nguyen2021Serine).

## Interactions
SHMT2 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It binds with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lung cancer cell lines, such as H1299, A549, and H460. This interaction involves the N-terminal 5K cluster of SHMT2 forming hydrophilic bonds with charged residues of EGFR, which is crucial for the hydroxymethylation of EGFR protein GS islands, leading to G>S editing (Chin2023EGFR). SHMT2 also interacts with the BRISC complex, a deubiquitinating enzyme complex, in the context of interferon responses. This interaction is enhanced upon interferon stimulation and is necessary for the deubiquitination of IFNAR1, affecting its subcellular localization and degradation (Zheng2013A). SHMT2's interaction with the BRISC complex is regulated by pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), with the inactive dimeric form of SHMT2 inhibiting BRISC activity by blocking the BRCC36 active site (Walden2019Metabolic). Additionally, SHMT2 is regulated by SIRT5, which desuccinylates SHMT2 at lysine 280, enhancing its enzymatic activity and promoting serine catabolism in cancer cells (Yang2018SHMT2).
