# YY1

## Overview
YY1 (Yin Yang 1) is a gene that encodes the YY1 transcription factor, a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. The YY1 transcription factor is characterized by its four C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and interact with various cellular and viral promoters. As a transcription factor, YY1 plays a dual role, functioning as both an activator and repressor of transcription, depending on the context and interacting partners. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as chromatin modification, 3D chromatin organization, and enhancer-promoter interactions. YY1's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its DNA-binding capacity and regulatory functions. The gene is clinically significant, with mutations linked to Gabriele-de Vries syndrome and implications in cancer progression due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation (Verheul2020The; Gabriele2017YY1).

## Structure
The YY1 transcription factor is a multifunctional protein characterized by its four C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. These zinc fingers are located in the C-terminal region and facilitate binding to various cellular and viral promoters in a sequence-specific manner (Ohtomo2007Molecular). The primary structure of YY1 includes specific amino acid sequences that form these zinc fingers, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures. The zinc fingers are involved in both DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, which are essential for YY1's regulatory functions (Bushmeyer1995Characterization).

YY1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its role in enhancer-promoter interactions (Weintraub2017YY1). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating YY1's activity. For instance, phosphorylation at threonines 348 and 378 affects its DNA-binding activity during mitosis (Rizkallah2009Regulation). These modifications can alter YY1's function and interactions, impacting gene expression and cellular processes. YY1 also has splice variants that may lead to different isoforms with distinct regulatory roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
YY1 (Yin Yang 1) is a transcription factor that plays a dual role as both an activator and repressor of transcription in healthy human cells. It is involved in various molecular processes, including chromatin modification and 3D chromatin organization. YY1 influences gene expression by interacting with chromatin modifiers such as Polycomb complexes, histone deacetylases (HDACs), and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which can either silence or activate gene expression (Verheul2020The). 

YY1's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation, which affects its DNA-binding capacity and its ability to act as a repressor or activator. For instance, acetylation is necessary for YY1 to activate the Otx2 gene during mouse neuroectoderm development (Verheul2020The). YY1 also plays a role in forming DNA loops that facilitate long-distance interactions between enhancers and promoters, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation (Verheul2020The).

In the central nervous system, YY1 is essential for neurogenesis and maintaining homeostasis in the developing brain. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing by binding intronic enhancer motifs and is crucial for neuronal development, with its absence leading to severe developmental issues (Verheul2020The). YY1's involvement in chromatin rearrangement and its regulatory functions in different tissues highlight its importance in healthy human cells (Verheul2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the YY1 gene are associated with Gabriele-de Vries syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphism, and neurological manifestations. This syndrome results from YY1 haploinsufficiency, which leads to transcriptional and chromatin dysfunction (Gabriele2017YY1). Specific mutations, such as de novo missense and truncating variants, disrupt YY1's DNA-binding ability and interaction with cofactors, contributing to the syndrome's clinical features (Morales‐Rosado2018A; Gabriele2017YY1). 

In addition to intellectual disability, patients with YY1 mutations may experience a range of symptoms, including intrauterine growth restriction, feeding problems, congenital malformations, and movement abnormalities (Gabriele2017YY1). Some cases have reported autoimmune myasthenia gravis and epilepsy, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of YY1-associated conditions (Woo2023A; Morales‐Rosado2018A). 

Alterations in YY1 expression levels are also implicated in cancer progression, as YY1 plays a critical role in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. Dysregulation of YY1 can lead to tumor progression and other diseases, highlighting its clinical significance beyond neurodevelopmental disorders (Gabriele2017YY1).

## Interactions
YY1 (Yin Yang 1) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its role in transcriptional regulation. YY1 can act as both a repressor and an activator of transcription, depending on its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), to repress transcription by recruiting corepressors that modify chromatin structure (Thomas1999Unlocking). YY1 also recruits coactivators like CBP and p300, which have histone acetyltransferase activity, to activate transcription (Thomas1999Unlocking).

YY1 forms a ternary complex with Hdm2 and p53, promoting p53 polyubiquitination and degradation, thus acting as a negative regulator of p53 (Inoue2015Transcription). It also interacts with the long non-coding RNA Linc-YY1, which modulates YY1's activity by evicting the YY1/PRC2 complex from chromatin, leading to the de-repression of target genes (Zhou2015LincYY1).

YY1 is involved in enhancer-promoter interactions, playing a structural role in maintaining these loops, which are crucial for gene expression regulation (Weintraub2017YY1). It can also be sumoylated by PIASy, affecting its transcriptional activity on various promoters (Deng2007PIASyMediated).
