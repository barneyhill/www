# ANHX

## Overview
The ANHX gene encodes the anomalous homeobox protein, which is a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, a DNA-binding domain that allows them to regulate the expression of target genes involved in developmental processes and cellular differentiation. The anomalous homeobox protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and has been implicated in various signaling pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of the ANHX gene and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating their roles in normal development and disease.
