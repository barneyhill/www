# NDST1

## Overview
The NDST1 gene encodes the enzyme N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 1, a bifunctional enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan involved in numerous cellular processes. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase due to its involvement in the transfer of sulfate groups. NDST1 is responsible for the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues within HS chains, modifications that are crucial for the structural and functional diversity of HS. These modifications influence the binding properties of HS, affecting interactions with growth factors and morphogens, which are essential for cellular signaling and tissue development (Li2016Heparan; Ledin2004Heparan). The enzyme's activity is critical for normal embryonic development and organogenesis, as evidenced by severe developmental defects in NDST1-deficient animal models (Grobe2002Heparan). NDST1's function is integral to processes such as morphogen binding, enzyme activation, and extracellular matrix organization, underscoring its importance in both developmental and physiological contexts (Ledin2004Heparan).

## Structure
The NDST1 protein is a bifunctional enzyme involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, featuring distinct domains responsible for its dual enzymatic activities. The primary structure includes a signal peptide and catalytic domains, with potential glycosylation sites that influence its stability and activity (MycroftWest2023Structural). The secondary and tertiary structures of NDST1 involve alpha-helices and beta-sheets forming a compact fold. Specifically, the sulfotransferase domain is characterized by a five-stranded parallel β-sheet with α helices on both sides, similar to the fold found in estrogen sulfotransferase and nucleotide kinases (Kakuta1999Crystal).

The NDST1 protein adopts an 'elbow' shaped monomeric structure with three distinct domains: the N-terminal domain, the central deacetylase domain, and the C-terminal sulfotransferase domain (MycroftWest2023Structural). The sulfotransferase domain, located at the C-terminus, has a well-defined binding cleft for heparan sulfate polysaccharides and binds 5'-phosphoadenosine-3'-phosphate (PAP) through various interactions (MycroftWest2023Structural). The central domain is responsible for deacetylase activity, adopting a (β/α)7 barrel fold with a His-His-Asp triad that coordinates Ca2+ ions, essential for its enzymatic function (MycroftWest2023Structural).

NDST1 may exist as a monomer or dimer, indicating possible quaternary structures (MycroftWest2023Structural). Multiple splice variants of NDST1 exist, contributing to its functional diversity (MycroftWest2023Structural).

## Function
The NDST1 gene encodes the enzyme N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan essential for various cellular functions. NDST1 is responsible for the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues in HS chains, a modification that is vital for the structural integrity and functional capacity of HS. This process affects the charge density and binding properties of HS, influencing interactions with growth factors and morphogens, which are critical for cellular signaling and tissue development (Li2016Heparan; Ledin2004Heparan).

In healthy human cells, NDST1 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies HS chains to create domains of N-sulfated disaccharide units. These modifications are essential for subsequent enzymatic activities, such as GlcA C5-epimerization and various O-sulfation reactions, which contribute to the structural diversity of HS chains (Li2016Heparan). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal embryonic development and organogenesis, as evidenced by severe developmental defects observed in animal models with NDST1 deficiency (Grobe2002Heparan). NDST1's role in HS biosynthesis is also important for processes like morphogen binding, enzyme activation, and cellular signaling (Ledin2004Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDST1 gene are associated with a range of developmental and physiological abnormalities. NDST1 mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive intellectual disability, characterized by developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and intellectual disability with low IQ scores (Reuter2014NDST1). Specific missense mutations in the NDST1 gene, such as c.1918T > C (p.Phe640Leu) and c.1831G > A (p.Gly611Ser), have been identified in affected individuals, impacting the sulfotransferase domain and leading to structural and functional impairments of the protein (Reuter2014NDST1).

In addition to intellectual disability, NDST1 mutations can cause developmental delays, craniofacial abnormalities, and severe respiratory problems. For instance, a clinical case involving a girl with compound heterozygous mutations in NDST1 presented with developmental delay, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, and severe respiratory issues in infancy, expanding the understanding of NDST1 syndrome (Armstrong2017A). In animal models, NDST1 deficiency results in similar phenotypes, including respiratory failure and craniofacial defects, highlighting the gene's critical role in development (Grobe2002Heparan; Fan2000Targeted). These findings underscore the importance of NDST1 in human development and its potential impact on various physiological processes.

## Interactions
NDST1 interacts with various proteins and molecules, playing a crucial role in its enzymatic functions. The protein has been shown to interact with heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides through its sulfotransferase domain, which contains a well-defined binding cleft for these substrates. This interaction is facilitated by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and π-stacking interactions with 5'-phosphoadenosine-3'-phosphate (PAP) (MycroftWest2023Structural).

NDST1 also forms complexes with nanobodies, which can modulate its activity. For instance, nanobody nAb7 binds to the deacetylase domain of NDST1, inhibiting its activity by blocking the substrate cleft. This interaction is mediated by specific hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Conversely, nanobody nAb13 binds to a different region of the deacetylase domain, enhancing NDST1 activity by ordering certain loops that form part of the deacetylase cleft, thus reducing the entropic penalty for substrate engagement (MycroftWest2023Structural).

The enzyme's interactions with its substrates and modulators are essential for its function in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, influencing cellular processes such as growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix organization (MycroftWest2023Structural).
