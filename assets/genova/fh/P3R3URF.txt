# P3R3URF

## Overview
P3R3URF is a gene that encodes the PIK3R3 upstream open reading frame, which is a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of the cell cycle and cellular processes such as adhesion and migration. PIK3R3 interacts with various proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein and members of the tetraspanin family, through phospho-tyrosine-dependent mechanisms, which are significant in cancer biology (Grossmann2015Phospho‐tyrosine; Xia2003The). The gene has clinical significance due to its involvement in the mTOR signaling pathway, with mutations linked to focal cortical dysplasia, a condition associated with epilepsy (Tidball2023Genomewide). Understanding the function and interactions of PIK3R3 is essential for elucidating its role in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PIK3R3 gene, which is associated with the P3R3URF, have been implicated in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a condition linked to epilepsy. A genome-wide CRISPRi screen in human iNeurons identified PIK3R3 as a candidate gene involved in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in FCD due to somatic mutations (Tidball2023Genomewide). Knockdown of PIK3R3 resulted in increased phosphorylation of AKT, a key component of the PI3K complex, suggesting its role in the hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway, a hallmark of FCD (Tidball2023Genomewide). 

The study also noted that missense variants in PIK3R3 have been identified in FCD patient tissues, supporting its potential involvement in the condition (Tidball2023Genomewide). PIK3R3, along with HIP1, was found to regulate the AKT/mTOR/S6 pathway, further suggesting its role in the etiology of FCD (Tidball2023Genomewide). These findings indicate that PIK3R3 mutations or expression alterations could contribute to FCD through their impact on mTOR signaling, making it a potential target for further research and inclusion in FCD gene panels (Tidball2023Genomewide).

## Interactions
PIK3R3, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), where the N-terminal 24 amino acids of PIK3R3 are sufficient for binding. This interaction can induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, highlighting its role in cell cycle regulation (Xia2003The).

PIK3R3 also participates in phospho-tyrosine-dependent interactions. It interacts with TSPAN2, a member of the tetraspanin family, through phosphorylated tyrosine residues. This interaction is crucial for cellular processes such as cell adhesion and migration, often linked to cancer. The binding of PIK3R3 to TSPAN2 is dependent on the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine sites, such as Y124 (Grossmann2015Phospho‐tyrosine).

Additionally, PIK3R3 is involved in the Ras-MAPK/PI3K signaling pathways, where it interacts with proteins like NM_005689 ABCB6 and NM_002931 RING1, as identified through yeast two-hybrid systems and validated by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Wang2008Protein). These interactions underscore the complexity and significance of PIK3R3 in cellular signaling networks.
