# GNB1

## Overview
The GNB1 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 1 (Gβ1), a pivotal component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in cellular signal transduction. This protein is categorized as a signaling molecule, playing a crucial role in the transmission of signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to various intracellular effectors. The Gβ1 subunit, characterized by its seven-bladed beta-propeller structure formed by WD40 repeat motifs, is essential for the assembly and function of the G protein complex, interacting with both Gα and Gγ subunits to form a stable heterotrimer. This complex is integral to numerous physiological processes, including the regulation of ion channels, enzymes, and kinases. Mutations in the GNB1 gene have been linked to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders and hematological malignancies, underscoring its clinical significance (Hemati2018Refining; Da2021Case; Wang2022BCORL1; Wall1995The).

## Structure
The GNB1 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 1, which is a crucial component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in signal transduction. The primary structure of GNB1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of beta sheets and alpha helices, which contribute to the formation of its tertiary structure, a seven-bladed beta-propeller. This beta-propeller structure is formed by WD40 repeat motifs, which are known for their role in protein-protein interactions and the assembly of large molecular complexes (Da2021Case; Wall1995The).

The quaternary structure of GNB1 involves its interaction with the G protein subunits alpha and gamma, forming a heterotrimeric complex. This interaction is essential for the stabilization of the inactive GDP-bound form of the alpha subunit, preventing GDP release (Wall1995The). The WD40 domain within GNB1 is crucial for its function, providing a scaffold for protein interactions and contributing to the structural integrity of the protein (Da2021Case).

Common post-translational modifications of GNB1 include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity and interactions within the cell. The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance (Da2021Case).

## Function
The GNB1 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 1 (Gβ1), which is a critical component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. These proteins play a vital role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface to various intracellular effectors, influencing numerous physiological processes (Hemati2018Refining; Schultz‐Rogers2020Haploinsufficiency). In healthy human cells, Gβ1 forms a complex with Gα and Gγ subunits, which is essential for the proper functioning of G proteins (Lohmann2017Novel). 

The Gβ1 subunit is involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways, including those mediated by the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) (Lohmann2017Novel). It interacts with Gα and Gγ subunits to form heterotrimers that are crucial for the propagation of signaling pathways, such as the D1R signaling pathway (Lohmann2017Novel). The Gβγ subunits can regulate a variety of effectors, including ion channels, enzymes, and kinases, which are important for cellular responses to external stimuli (Ford1998Molecular). GNB1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, contributing to the regulation of numerous physiological responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNB1 gene, which encodes the G protein subunit beta 1, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Hemati2018Refining; Da2021Case). GNB1 mutations can also lead to GNB1 encephalopathy, characterized by neurological impairments, abnormal muscle tone, vision issues, epilepsy, and gastrointestinal abnormalities (Da2021Case; Choi2023Case).

The gene is highly intolerant to genetic variation, and mutations often occur in regions critical for its function, such as the WD40 domain, which is important for protein interactions (Lohmann2017Novel; Da2021Case). Specific mutations, like the A73T substitution, can disrupt the G protein complex's function, leading to significant clinical manifestations (Da2021Case).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, GNB1 mutations have been implicated in hematological malignancies, including myeloid and B-cell neoplasms (Wang2022BCORL1). The presence of GNB1 mutations in these conditions highlights the gene's broader clinical significance beyond neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The GNB1 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 1 (Gβ1), which is a crucial component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Gβ1 interacts with Gα and Gγ subunits to form a functional heterotrimer that is essential for signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Lohmann2017Novel). The Gβ1 subunit forms a dimer with Gγ subunits, such as Gγ7, which is important for the propagation of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) signaling in the striatum (Lohmann2017Novel). 

Gβ1 also interacts with various effector molecules, including adenylyl cyclase isoforms, phospholipases, ion channels, and protein tyrosine kinases, modulating classical G protein-coupled effector pathways (Dupré2009The). The interaction between Gβ and Gγ subunits is crucial for signal transduction, with specific combinations affecting signaling specificity and efficiency (Dupré2009The). 

Structurally, Gβ1 forms a propeller-like structure with seven blades, interacting extensively with the Gγ subunit through a coiled-coil interaction and with the Gα subunit, contributing to the stabilization of the G protein complex (Wall1995The). These interactions are primarily hydrophobic and are complemented by electrostatic interactions (Wall1995The).
