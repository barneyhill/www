# NBPF3

## Overview
Neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 3 (NBPF3) is a gene located on human chromosome 1, which encodes the NBPF member 3 protein. This protein is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, a group of proteins characterized by their involvement in neural development and potential roles in oncogenesis. The NBPF3 gene is notable for its complex structure, which includes multiple tandem repeats that are thought to contribute to its functional diversity. The protein encoded by NBPF3 is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research suggests that alterations in NBPF3 expression or function may be associated with certain pathological conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
