# CAV1

## Overview
CAV1 is a gene that encodes the protein caveolin-1, a crucial component of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, lipid regulation, and endocytosis. It is characterized by its ability to oligomerize and interact with a wide range of signaling molecules, thereby influencing cellular responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Razani2001Caveolin-1; Williams2004Thecaveolinproteins). The protein is integral to the regulation of endothelial function, mechanosensation, and lipid metabolism, and its dysfunction is implicated in several diseases, such as lipodystrophy syndromes and pulmonary arterial hypertension (Parton2007The; Cao2008Heterozygous).

## Structure
Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a 178-amino acid protein integral to the structure of caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane. It has a characteristic hairpin-like structure that allows it to insert into membranes, with both the N- and C-terminal domains exposed to the cytoplasm (Krishna2019Interplay; Williams2004Thecaveolinproteins). The protein is organized into four domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-81), the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) (residues 82-101), the intramembrane domain (IMD) (residues 102-134), and the C-terminal domain (residues 135-178) (Krishna2019Interplay).

The CSD is a highly conserved region that interacts with various signaling molecules and contains a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif, which targets proteins to cholesterol-rich membrane domains (Goetz2008Caveolin-1; Krishna2019Interplay). The IMD is the main site of membrane insertion and adopts a hairpin-like structure, comprising a helix-break-helix motif (Krishna2019Interplay).

CAV1 forms oligomeric complexes, typically consisting of 14-16 monomers, which are crucial for its function in caveolae formation and signaling (Williams2004Thecaveolinproteins). Post-translational modifications include palmitoylation on cysteine residues and tyrosine phosphorylation, which are important for its oligomerization and signaling roles (Goetz2008Caveolin-1; Krishna2019Interplay). There are two isoforms of CAV1, alpha and beta, with the beta isoform having a shorter amino terminus (Williams2004Thecaveolinproteins).

## Function
Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a critical protein for the formation of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, signal transduction, and lipid regulation. CAV1 is involved in the internalization of certain lipids and proteins, influencing cellular responses to detachment from the extracellular matrix (Parton2007The). It acts as a scaffolding protein, negatively regulating the activity of signaling molecules by binding to them, and is involved in the compartmentalization of signaling molecules, facilitating cross-talk among signaling cascades (Razani2001Caveolin-1).

In endothelial cells, CAV1 functions as a tonic inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), playing a role in regulating vascular tone and maintaining endothelial barrier function (Parton2007The; Razani2001Caveolin-1). CAV1 is also crucial for mechanosensation, as it redistributes in response to shear stress, enhancing mechanosensitivity and activating specific signaling pathways (Parton2007The). In adipocytes, CAV1 is involved in lipid regulation, facilitating the uptake of fatty acids and cholesterol, and is essential for efficient liver regeneration and survival after partial hepatectomy (Parton2007The). The absence of CAV1 leads to hyperproliferative and vascular abnormalities, highlighting its role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Razani2001Caveolin-1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAV1 gene are associated with several diseases, including lipodystrophy syndromes and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Rare heterozygous frameshift mutations in CAV1, such as I134fsdelA-X137 and -88delC, have been linked to atypical partial lipodystrophy and hypertriglyceridemia. These mutations result in premature protein termination, affecting the carboxy terminal half of the protein, and are associated with clinical features like severe hyperlipoproteinemia and insulin resistance (Cao2008Heterozygous).

CAV1 mutations are also implicated in congenital generalized lipodystrophy and neonatal onset lipodystrophy syndromes. For instance, the c.400delA and c.474delA mutations are associated with these conditions, characterized by generalized fat loss and metabolic abnormalities (Garg2015Whole).

In the context of PAH, the P158PfsX22 mutation introduces a novel C-terminus in the CAV1 protein, leading to a dominant negative effect that disrupts caveolae assembly and function. This mutation causes the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing caveolae numbers and altering CAV1 trafficking (Copeland2017A). The F160X mutation is also associated with both PAH and congenital generalized lipodystrophy, affecting the stability of CAV1 complexes (Han2016Characterization).

## Interactions
Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a scaffolding protein that interacts with a variety of signaling molecules and proteins. It is known to oligomerize, with this ability mapped to the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain between amino acids 80 and 101. This domain interacts with several signaling molecules, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin receptor, transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGFβRI), and neurotrophin receptors TrkA/p75NTR (Liu2002Multiple).

CAV1 also interacts with serine/threonine protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, inhibiting their activity through its scaffolding domain. This inhibition maintains the phosphorylated state of Akt, a key component in the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival in prostate cancer cells (Li2003Caveolin1).

In the context of TGF-β signaling, CAV1 interacts with the TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) and Smad proteins, modulating the pathway by inhibiting Smad-2 phosphorylation and its interaction with Smad-4, thus dampening the signaling cascade (Razani2001Caveolin1).

CAV1 also forms complexes with G protein α subunits, Src-family tyrosine kinases, and prenylated proteins such as Ras, indicating its role in various signaling pathways (Song1996Copurification).
