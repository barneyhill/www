# PGRMC1

## Overview
PGRMC1, or progesterone receptor membrane component 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including steroid metabolism, apoptosis regulation, and cell division. The protein, categorized as a heme-binding transmembrane protein, is characterized by a unique structure that includes a single transmembrane region and a heme-binding motif similar to cytochrome b5, although it coordinates heme differently (Kabe2018Function; Kabe2016Haemdependent). PGRMC1 is implicated in critical physiological and pathological processes, such as cancer proliferation and chemoresistance, through its interactions with proteins like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytochromes P450 (Kabe2016Haemdependent). Its expression and function are significant in reproductive tissues, influencing processes like decidualization in the endometrium (Salsano2017Dynamic). The protein's involvement in cancer biology, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Mansouri2008Alterations; Adhikary2017Role).

## Structure
PGRMC1 is a heme-binding protein with a unique molecular structure that includes a single transmembrane region at the N-terminus and a heme-binding motif homologous to cytochrome b5 in the central region (Kabe2018Function). Unlike cytochrome b5, PGRMC1 lacks conserved histidine residues for heme binding, instead coordinating heme through a five-coordinated bond with a tyrosine residue, specifically Tyr113 (Kabe2018Function; Kabe2016Haemdependent). The heme is exposed on the protein's surface, facilitating a stable dimer formation through heme-heme stacking interactions, a phenomenon not previously observed in eukaryotes (Kabe2018Function; Kabe2016Haemdependent).

The protein's tertiary structure, as revealed by X-ray crystallography at 1.95 Å resolution, shows an overall fold similar to cytochrome b5, but with distinct heme iron coordination (Kabe2016Haemdependent). PGRMC1's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytochromes P450, impacting cancer proliferation and chemoresistance (Kabe2016Haemdependent).

PGRMC1 also exhibits a non-conventional membrane topology, with the C-terminal domain exposed on the cell surface, contrary to typical intracellular orientation (Kim2019Epitope). This unique topology is supported by monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes on the C-terminal domain, indicating its extracellular presence (Kim2019Epitope).

## Function
PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is involved in various cellular processes, including steroid metabolism, apoptosis regulation, and cell division. It binds heme, influencing steroid synthesis and cytochrome P450 enzyme activity, which can affect the production of sex hormones and glucocorticoids (Cahill2007Progesterone). PGRMC1 plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis by regulating gene expression, making cells more resistant to programmed cell death. This anti-apoptotic function is crucial for cell survival and is mediated by its interaction with progesterone (Peluso2010Progesterone).

In the context of the endometrium, PGRMC1 is expressed throughout the menstrual cycle and is involved in the decidualization process, where it regulates cell differentiation and survival. Its expression decreases during the late secretory phase, and overexpression can inhibit decidualization, indicating its importance in normal endometrial physiology (Salsano2017Dynamic).

PGRMC1 is also implicated in cell division, particularly in mitotic and meiotic processes. It interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and spindle microtubules, affecting cell shape, migration, and division. This role is crucial for proper cell division and is linked to its localization in various cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, and mitochondria (Lodde2022Insights).

## Clinical Significance
PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is implicated in various cancers, including breast, lung, ovarian, and cervical cancers. Its overexpression is associated with tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, contributing to poor prognosis and lower survival rates in patients. In breast cancer, high PGRMC1 expression correlates with increased tumor metastasis and osteolytic bone damage, particularly in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, while being downregulated in stromal cells of invasive breast cancer (Adhikary2017Role). In triple-negative breast cancer, PGRMC1 is significantly overexpressed, and lower expression levels are linked to better overall survival rates (Xu2021Comprehensive).

In ovarian cancer, PGRMC1 is up-regulated in ovarian carcinoma but downregulated in other subtypes like Ovarian Serous Surface Papillary Carcinoma (Adhikary2017Role). Mutations in PGRMC1, such as the H165R missense mutation, have been linked to premature ovarian failure (POF) by disrupting its interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes, leading to increased apoptosis in ovarian cells (Mansouri2008Alterations). This mutation affects the gene's anti-apoptotic function, contributing to ovarian dysfunction and potentially early menopause (Mansouri2008Alterations).

PGRMC1's role in cancer biology extends to its involvement in regulating autophagy, apoptosis, and chemo-resistance, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Adhikary2017Role). Its phosphorylation status also influences cancer cell metabolism and genomic stability, affecting pathways related to cell differentiation and DNA damage repair (Thejer2020PGRMC1a).

## Interactions
PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), where its haem-dependent dimerization is crucial for binding. This interaction is significant for EGFR signaling, which is involved in cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Kabe2016Haemdependent; Ahmed2010Pgrmc1). PGRMC1 also interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. This interaction is haem-dependent and facilitates the metabolism of drugs like doxorubicin, contributing to chemoresistance (Kabe2016Haemdependent; Rohe2009PGRMC1).

PGRMC1 is suggested to function as a heme chaperone, interacting with ferrochelatase (FECH) and potentially regulating its activity by stabilizing specific conformational states (Piel2016A). It also interacts with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor complex in pancreatic β cells, indicating a role in insulin signaling (Zhang2014Progesterone). These interactions highlight PGRMC1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and metabolism, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and other diseases.
