# MIA2

## Overview
MIA2 is a gene that encodes the MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 2, a transmembrane protein integral to the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells. This protein is primarily involved in the export of proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, a critical step in cellular trafficking. MIA2 is characterized by its structural homology to MIA3/TANGO1 and Drosophila Tango1, particularly in its N-terminal SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its function (Pitman2011Reduced; Lougheed2001Structure). The protein's role in lipid metabolism is underscored by its involvement in the export of bulky lipid particles, such as pre-chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), in cooperation with TANGO1 (Santos2016TANGO1). MIA2 is predominantly active in the liver, where it contributes to cholesterol and triglyceride regulation, thus playing a significant role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Pitman2011Reduced). Alterations in the MIA2 gene have been linked to various cancers and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Kong2015A; Hellerbrand2007The).

## Structure
The MIA2 protein, also known as MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 2, is a transmembrane protein involved in the secretory process, localizing to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites. It shares structural homology with MIA3/TANGO1 and Drosophila Tango1, particularly in the N-terminal SH3 domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Pitman2011Reduced; Lougheed2001Structure). The SH3 domain is important for ligand binding and is affected by mutations such as the phenylalanine-to-serine substitution at position 91 (F91S), which impacts cholesterol metabolism (Pitman2011Reduced).

MIA2 contains a proline-rich C-terminal domain that interacts with COPII coat proteins Sec23 and Sec24, facilitating its role in ER export (Pitman2011Reduced). The protein is encoded by exons from both MIA2 and CTAGE5, suggesting the presence of multiple splice variant isoforms, including a full-length 240 kDa isoform (Pitman2011Reduced). MIA2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are characteristic of secretory proteins (Kong2015A). The protein's topology includes lumenally enclosed N-terminal regions and cytosolic C-terminal portions, similar to MIA3/TANGO1 (Pitman2011Reduced).

## Function
MIA2 (MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 2) is a protein that plays a critical role in the secretory pathway of cells, particularly in the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking by interacting with COPII coat proteins, such as Sec23 and Sec24, which are essential for the formation of transport vesicles (Pitman2011Reduced). MIA2 localizes to ER exit sites, where it colocalizes with the COPII protein Sec31A, indicating its role in the assembly of COPII vesicles (Pitman2011Reduced).

The protein shares structural homology with Drosophila Tango1 and vertebrate Mia3/Tango1, suggesting a conserved function in cellular processes across species (Pitman2011Reduced). MIA2 is also involved in the export of bulky lipid particles, such as pre-chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), from the ER. It cooperates with TANGO1 and interacts with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) to facilitate the export of these lipid particles, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (Santos2016TANGO1).

In healthy human cells, MIA2 is primarily active in the liver, where it contributes to the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride levels, playing a significant role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Pitman2011Reduced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MIA2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and metabolic disorders. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a common genetic variant of MIA2, known as I141M, is associated with high levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and increased sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine. This variant correlates with improved survival in PDAC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that MIA2 I141M carriers may benefit more from such treatments (Kong2015A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MIA2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often downregulated in HCC, correlating with reduced expression of the transcription factor HNF-1. Re-expression of MIA2 in HCC cells has been shown to reduce their invasive potential and proliferation rate, highlighting its role in inhibiting tumor growth and invasion (Hellerbrand2007The).

Additionally, a mutation in the MIA2 gene, specifically the 'couch potato' (cpto) mutation, affects cholesterol metabolism. This mutation leads to reduced plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in mice, indicating a potential role in cholesterol homeostasis (Pitman2011Reduced).

## Interactions
MIA2, also known as MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 2, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export process. MIA2 interacts with COPII coat proteins, specifically Sec23 and Sec24, through its C-terminal proline-rich domain. This interaction is essential for its role in COPII vesicle assembly and the transport of cargo from the ER (Pitman2011Reduced). MIA2 also forms a complex with TANGO1, another ER exit site protein, to facilitate the export of bulky cargoes such as ApoB-containing lipid particles. This interaction is supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments showing that MIA2, also referred to as TALI when fused with cTAGE5, physically interacts with TANGO1 at ER exit sites (Santos2016TANGO1). The SH3-like domain of MIA2 is crucial for capturing pre-chylomicrons and pre-VLDLs, suggesting it may bind a common linker or chaperone for these cargoes (Santos2016TANGO1). These interactions highlight MIA2's role in the regulation of lipid metabolism and its involvement in the secretory pathway machinery (Pitman2011Reduced).
