# CINP

## Overview
CINP, or cyclin-dependent kinase 2 interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. The protein encoded by CINP is characterized by a coiled-coil motif, which facilitates its interaction with ATRIP, a component of the ATR-ATRIP complex. This interaction is essential for ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome integrity during DNA replication and repair (Lovejoy2009Functional). Although initially identified as a CDK2-interacting protein, subsequent studies have not confirmed a direct interaction with CDK2 (Lovejoy2009Functional). Beyond its role in DNA damage response, CINP also acts as a cofactor for the transcription factor KLF5, influencing cell proliferation and survival, and is implicated in various cancer types (Wu2018CINP).

## Structure
CINP (cyclin-dependent kinase 2 interacting protein) is a small protein characterized by a predicted coiled-coil motif, which is essential for its interaction with ATRIP, a component of the ATR-ATRIP complex involved in DNA damage response (Lovejoy2009Functional). The coiled-coil domain of CINP is necessary for ATRIP dimerization and stable ATR binding, playing a crucial role in ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling (Lovejoy2009Functional). Despite its identification as a CDK2-interacting protein, no direct interaction with CDK2 has been observed in subsequent experiments (Lovejoy2009Functional).

CINP does not accumulate in DNA-damage foci with ATRIP, suggesting it may not be an integral component of the active ATR signaling complex (Lovejoy2009Functional). It is not required for the localization of ATR-ATRIP to damage-induced foci or for the TopBP1-stimulated in vitro kinase activity of ATR-ATRIP complexes (Lovejoy2009Functional). CINP regulates ATR signaling partly by controlling cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of ATRIP, as its silencing results in a significant reduction in ATRIP S224 phosphorylation (Lovejoy2009Functional). The complete molecular structure, including potential post-translational modifications or splice variants, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
CINP (cyclin-dependent kinase 2 interacting protein) is a crucial component in the ATR-ATRIP signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining genome integrity. CINP interacts with ATRIP through its coiled-coil domain, facilitating ATRIP dimerization and stable ATR binding, which are necessary for effective ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling. This interaction is vital for the cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress, as CINP is required for efficient phosphorylation of CHK1 and SMC1, key proteins in the DNA damage response (Lovejoy2009Functional).

CINP also plays a significant role in maintaining the G2 checkpoint, ensuring that cells do not prematurely enter mitosis following DNA damage. Silencing CINP results in impaired ATR signaling and increased mitotic entry after genotoxic stress, similar to the effects observed with ATRIP silencing (Lovejoy2009Functional). Although CINP does not accumulate in DNA-damage foci, it regulates ATR signaling by controlling cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of ATRIP, particularly at the S224 site, which is phosphorylated by CDK2 (Lovejoy2009Functional).

In addition to its role in DNA damage response, CINP is involved in cell proliferation and survival, acting as a cofactor for KLF5, a transcription factor that regulates genes associated with cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Wu2018CINP).

## Interactions
CINP (cyclin-dependent kinase 2 interacting protein) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in genome maintenance and cell cycle regulation. CINP interacts with the ATR-ATRIP complex, specifically binding to the coiled-coil domain of ATRIP. This interaction is essential for ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, although it is described as transient or low affinity and is not enhanced by DNA damage or replication stress (Lovejoy2009Functional). CINP is necessary for efficient ATR signaling, as its silencing impairs ATR-dependent phosphorylation of effector proteins like CHK1 and SMC1 after genotoxic stress (Lovejoy2009Functional).

CINP also interacts with the transcription factor KLF5, acting as a cofactor necessary for KLF5's role in promoting cell proliferation, survival, and tumor growth. This interaction was validated through various experiments, including coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and is crucial for KLF5-mediated regulation of genes associated with the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as cyclin D1 and CASP7 (Wu2018CINP). The interaction between CINP and KLF5 is significant in multiple cancer types, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2018CINP).
