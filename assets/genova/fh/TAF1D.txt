# TAF1D

## Overview
TAF1D is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor, RNA polymerase I subunit D, which is a critical component of the SL1 complex involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase I. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at rRNA gene promoters, facilitating rRNA transcription essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (chen2023Depletion). TAF1D is predominantly active in the nucleolus and is subject to cell cycle-specific phosphorylation, indicating its regulatory role in transcription during different cell cycle phases (Pijnappel2009Quantitative). Additionally, TAF1D interacts with various chromatin remodeling factors, suggesting its involvement in broader transcriptional regulation processes (Tabar2024Intrinsically). In pathological contexts, such as lung adenocarcinoma, TAF1D has been implicated in oncogenic pathways through its interaction with long non-coding RNAs, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Sarkar2024LINC01116dependent).

## Function
TAF1D is a component of the SL1 complex, which is crucial for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase I. This complex is essential for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at the rRNA gene promoter, facilitating the transcription of rRNA, which is vital for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (chen2023Depletion). TAF1D is active in the nucleolus, where rRNA synthesis occurs, and its function is critical for cell growth and proliferation.

TAF1D undergoes cell cycle-specific phosphorylation, which suggests its involvement in regulating transcription during different phases of the cell cycle. Phosphorylation sites on TAF1D, such as S40, S137, and S234, are conserved from humans to mice, indicating important regulatory functions (Pijnappel2009Quantitative). These phosphorylations are thought to regulate the activity of TBP-containing complexes, including SL1, during the cell cycle (Pijnappel2009Quantitative).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, TAF1D interacts with the long non-coding RNA LINC01116, enhancing RNA polymerase I transcription and contributing to oncogenic phenotypes, although this interaction is not typical of healthy cells (Sarkar2024LINC01116dependent).

## Interactions
TAF1D is a component of the SL1 complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I. It interacts with other subunits of the SL1 complex, including TAF1A, TAF1B, and TAF1C, as well as the TATA-box binding protein (TBP). These interactions facilitate the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at ribosomal RNA gene promoters (Pijnappel2009Quantitative). 

The study by Pijnappel et al. highlights that TAF1D undergoes cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation, with specific phosphorylations at sites such as S234 during the G2/M phase. These modifications are evolutionarily conserved between humans and mice, suggesting a regulatory role in the cell cycle (Pijnappel2009Quantitative). 

TAF1D is also involved in interactions with chromatin remodeling factors. The study by Tabar et al. indicates that TAF1D interacts with CHD proteins, which are involved in nucleosome assembly and organization. This interaction suggests a role for TAF1D in nucleating RNA polymerase II formation at promoter regions, thereby influencing transcription regulation (Tabar2024Intrinsically). 

These interactions underscore the importance of TAF1D in transcriptional regulation and its potential involvement in broader chromatin remodeling processes.
