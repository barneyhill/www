# PNPLA3

## Overview
The PNPLA3 gene encodes the protein patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3, also known as adiponutrin, which is a member of the patatin-like phospholipase family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism, particularly within the liver and adipose tissue, where it plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid droplets. PNPLA3 is characterized by its enzymatic activities, including triacylglycerol lipase and acylglycerol transacylase functions, with a preference for mono-unsaturated fatty acids. The protein is associated with cellular membranes, notably the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, and is implicated in the remodeling of triglycerides and phospholipids, thereby influencing lipid storage and energy balance. A notable variant of the PNPLA3 gene, I148M, is linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to more severe liver conditions, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Yuan2020PNPLA3; Chamoun2013PNPLA3/adiponutrin; Pingitore2019The).

## Structure
The PNPLA3 protein is a 481 amino-acid member of the patatin-like phospholipase family, with a molecular weight of 53 KDa. It features a patatin-like domain, which includes a consensus serine lipase motif (Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly) and a catalytic dyad composed of Serine 47 and Aspartate 166, differing from the typical catalytic triad found in other lipases (He2010A; Pingitore2019The). The patatin fold positions the catalytic serine near the aspartate at the edge of a substrate-binding groove, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Pingitore2019The).

The protein is associated with cell membranes, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, and is proposed to have four transmembrane domains. However, these helices are suggested to be part of the protein's globular structure rather than spanning the membrane (Pingitore2019The). The PNPLA3 protein does not exhibit significant post-translational modifications like N-linked glycosylation, indicating it may not have a substantial ER-lumenal domain (Sherman2024The).

The I148M variant, resulting from an isoleucine to methionine substitution at position 148, is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This mutation is located near the catalytic dyad and is predicted to block substrate access, thereby inhibiting the protein's catalytic activity (He2010A).

## Function
PNPLA3, also known as adiponutrin, is a membrane protein involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver and adipose tissue. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipid droplets (LDs) within hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. PNPLA3 exhibits enzymatic activities, including triacylglycerol lipase and acylglycerol transacylase activities, with a preference for mono-unsaturated fatty acids (Pingitore2019The). The protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet membranes, where it acts as a lipid droplet regulator (Pingitore2019The).

In healthy human cells, PNPLA3 is involved in the remodeling of triglycerides and phospholipids stored in lipid droplets, influencing lipid storage and energy balance (Pingitore2019The). It is upregulated by insulin via SREBP-1c, indicating a role in lipid droplet remodeling post-meal (Pingitore2019The). The protein also hydrolyzes retinyl esters, releasing retinol from hepatic stellate cells, and is upregulated by TGF-β, especially after liver damage (Pingitore2019The).

PNPLA3's function in lipid metabolism is crucial for maintaining liver function and energy homeostasis, and its activity is regulated by nutritional status, decreasing during fasting and increasing upon re-feeding (Chamoun2013PNPLA3/adiponutrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PNPLA3 gene, particularly the I148M variant, are significantly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to more severe liver conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Yuan2020PNPLA3; Trépo2016PNPLA3). The I148M variant results in a loss of function that impairs triglyceride hydrolysis, leading to triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes and contributing to liver fat accumulation (Sookoian2011Meta‐analysis; Trépo2016PNPLA3). This variant is also linked to increased liver enzyme levels and is a strong predictor of NAFLD histological severity, including inflammation and fibrosis (Rotman2010The).

The PNPLA3 I148M variant affects the response to lifestyle interventions and treatments, with carriers showing greater responsiveness to calorie restriction but less to omega-3 fatty acids and statins (Yuan2020PNPLA3). Ethnic differences in the prevalence of the risk allele have been observed, with higher frequencies in individuals of Hispanic and Asian descent (Rotman2010The; Yuan2020PNPLA3). The variant's role in liver disease progression underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions and its importance in personalized medicine approaches for NAFLD (Bruschi2020Metabolic; Yuan2020PNPLA3).

## Interactions
PNPLA3, also known as adiponutrin, is involved in lipid metabolism and interacts with various proteins that influence lipid droplet formation and metabolism. One significant interaction is with ABHD5, a coactivator of the lipase PNPLA2. Although ABHD5 does not possess lipase activity itself, it enhances the lipase function of PNPLA2, leading to reduced lipid droplet size. When co-expressed with PNPLA3, ABHD5 significantly reduces lipid droplet size, even when PNPLA3's lipase domain is inactive. This suggests that ABHD5 may regulate PNPLA3 activity through mechanisms other than direct lipase activity, possibly by interfering with PNPLA3's transacylase activity or activating another lipase, such as PNPLA2 (Chamoun2013PNPLA3/adiponutrin).

The PNPLA3 I148M variant, which lacks enzymatic activity, is associated with increased lipid droplet size and hepatic steatosis. This variant may function as a transacylase or mediator of lipid storage rather than a lipase, as it does not increase triglyceride hydrolysis in vitro. The interaction between PNPLA3 and ABHD5 suggests that PNPLA3 may enhance PNPLA2's lipase activity, contributing to lipid droplet remodeling (Chamoun2013PNPLA3/adiponutrin).
