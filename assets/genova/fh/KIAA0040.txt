# KIAA0040

## Overview
KIAA0040 is a human gene located on chromosome 1q, encoding a protein of the same name. While the precise biological function of the KIAA0040 protein remains largely undefined, it is not currently categorized into a specific protein family such as kinases or receptors. The gene has garnered research interest due to its potential involvement in alcohol dependence (AD), as identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and family-based genetic analyses. These studies have suggested that KIAA0040 may play a role in the genetic predisposition to AD, possibly through interactions with neurotransmitter systems and the ethanol metabolic pathway (Zuo2011Genome-Wide; Hill2013Familybased). Despite these associations, further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which KIAA0040 influences AD and to determine the functional role of the protein it encodes.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The KIAA0040 gene has been implicated in alcohol dependence (AD) through various genetic studies. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified KIAA0040 on chromosome 1q as a potential risk gene for AD, with significant association signals found in both European American and African American populations. The study suggested that KIAA0040 might harbor a causal variant for AD, as its expression was significantly correlated with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and the ethanol metabolic pathway (Zuo2011Genome-Wide). 

Another study using a family-based approach also found significant associations between several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the KIAA0040 gene and alcohol dependence. This research highlighted the gene's potential importance in the genetic risk for this disorder, although the biological significance remains unclear due to the unknown function of the KIAA0040 protein (Hill2013Familybased).

The KIAA0040 gene's involvement in AD is further supported by its location near the TNN gene, which is implicated in neural processes and alcohol dependence. Despite these findings, the exact biological mechanisms by which KIAA0040 influences alcohol dependence are not fully understood, and the clinical significance of these associations requires further investigation (Hill2013Familybased).
