# FXYD2

## Overview
The FXYD2 gene encodes the FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 2, a regulatory subunit of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase enzyme complex. This protein, also known as the gamma subunit, is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in modulating ion transport across the plasma membrane, particularly in renal tissues. FXYD2 is characterized by a conserved FXYD motif and is involved in regulating the enzyme's affinity for sodium and potassium ions, thereby influencing ion homeostasis and cellular function (Arystarkhova2016Beneficial; Geering2005Function). The gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with significant expression in the kidney, pancreas, and sensory neurons, and is implicated in conditions such as hypomagnesemia and certain cancers (Zhou2021FXYD2; Arystarkhova2016Beneficial).

## Structure
The FXYD2 protein, also known as the γ subunit of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, is a member of the FXYD family characterized by a conserved FXYD motif. It is a type I membrane protein with a single transmembrane helix and an extracellular N-terminus (Geering2005Function). The primary structure of FXYD2 includes a sequence motif 'TVRKGGLIFAGLAFVVGLLILLSKRF', which forms a transmembrane dimer (Rath2009Peptide). 

FXYD2 has two splice variants, FXYD2a and FXYD2b, which are primarily expressed in the kidney's medullary thick ascending limb. These variants associate with Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase α1-β complexes, influencing the enzyme's affinity for Na⁺ and K⁺ (Geering2005Function). 

Post-translational modifications of FXYD2 include phosphorylation, which can modulate its interaction with Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and affect its regulatory function (Geering2005Function). A mutation in a conserved glycine residue in FXYD2 has been linked to human hypomagnesemia, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity (Geering2005Function). 

The FXYD2 protein plays a crucial role in modulating the transport properties of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, particularly in renal tissues, by altering the enzyme's apparent affinities for sodium, potassium, and ATP (Rossier2015Epithelial).

## Function
The FXYD2 gene encodes a regulatory subunit of the Na,K-ATPase enzyme, which is crucial for maintaining ion gradients across the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. This protein, known as the gamma subunit, modulates the activity of Na,K-ATPase by decreasing its affinity for sodium ions (Na+) and reducing its maximum velocity (Vmax) (Arystarkhova2016Beneficial). FXYD2 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, primarily in the kidney, pancreas, and sensory neurons, with potential expression in mammary glands (Arystarkhova2016Beneficial).

In healthy cells, FXYD2 plays a role in adapting to osmotic stress by upregulating its expression in response to hyperosmotic conditions, which enhances Na,K-ATPase activity without altering its apparent affinities for Na+, K+, or ATP (Cairo2009FXYD2). This regulatory function is essential for maintaining ion homeostasis and proper cellular function. In the pancreas, FXYD2 is involved in insulin regulation, with its expression linked to the regulation of beta cell mass and insulin secretion (Arystarkhova2016Beneficial).

FXYD2 also acts as an endogenous inhibitory subunit of Na,K-ATPase, affecting the pump's activity and participating in the fine-tuning of its signaling role, particularly in the kidney (Arystarkhova2016Beneficial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FXYD2 gene, particularly the p.Gly41Arg mutation, are associated with isolated dominant hypomagnesaemia (IDH), a condition characterized by low blood magnesium levels. This mutation leads to a trafficking defect that prevents the γ-subunit of the Na+-K+-ATPase from reaching the basolateral membrane, impairing magnesium reabsorption in the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (Sha2008Human; de2015Recurrent). Clinical manifestations of this condition include muscle cramps, epilepsy, and disturbances in potassium and calcium homeostasis (de2015Recurrent). The mutation has been identified in multiple families, suggesting a founder effect (de2015Recurrent).

Alterations in FXYD2 expression are also linked to other conditions. For instance, mutations in transcriptional regulators of FXYD2, such as HNF-1B and PCBD1, can lead to hypomagnesemia by affecting FXYD2 expression and function (Mayan2018Renal). In gliomas, higher FXYD2 mRNA expression is associated with better prognosis and increased sensitivity to temozolomide chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhou2021FXYD2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FXYD2 in various diseases related to magnesium homeostasis and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
FXYD2, also known as the gamma subunit of Na,K-ATPase, is involved in specific interactions with the Na,K-ATPase complex, particularly with its α and β subunits. The interaction is crucial for modulating the enzyme's ion transport activity. FXYD2 associates with Na,K-ATPase in a tissue-specific manner, primarily affecting the apparent affinity for extracellular K+ and intracellular Na+ (Li2004Structural; Geering2005Function). The transmembrane segment 9 (TM9) of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit plays a significant role in the stable association with FXYD2, with specific amino acids like Leu 964 and Phe 967 being critical for this interaction (Li2004Structural).

FXYD2's interaction with Na,K-ATPase is not essential for the enzyme's expression or activity but is necessary for the stability of FXYD2 itself (Geering2005Function). The FXYD motif is required for this stable association. The interaction of FXYD2 with Na,K-ATPase decreases the enzyme's apparent affinity for intracellular Na+, which is beneficial for efficient Na+ extrusion in the renal nephron, particularly in the thick ascending limb where FXYD2 is expressed (Geering2005Function). These interactions are physiologically relevant, especially in the context of renal function and ion homeostasis.
