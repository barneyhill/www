# MROH1

## Overview
MROH1 is a gene that encodes the protein maestro heat-like repeat family member 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its heat-like repeat domains, which suggest a role in protein-protein interactions, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. MROH1 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer, alterations in the MROH1 gene, such as transcript fusions and copy number variations, have been associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance (Sharbatoghli2022Copy; ILNYTSKYY2023Genomewide). Additionally, MROH1 has been identified as a potential causal gene in COPD through transcriptome-wide association studies, highlighting its significance in respiratory diseases (Obeidat2017Leveraging). These associations underscore the importance of MROH1 in both oncological and respiratory contexts, making it a potential target for future therapeutic strategies.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MROH1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. In NSCLC, MROH1 is involved in multiple transcript fusions, significantly affecting patient survival. Patients with MROH1 transcript fusions exhibit decreased life expectancy, with a hazard ratio of 14.04, indicating a strong negative impact on survival (ILNYTSKYY2023Genomewide). 

In ovarian cancer, MROH1 shows significant copy number variations (CNVs) in patients resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These CNVs correlate with increased mRNA expression levels, which are associated with chemotherapy resistance and reduced overall survival. The gene's high amplification in resistant patients suggests its role in treatment resistance, making it a potential biomarker for predicting chemotherapy outcomes (Sharbatoghli2022Copy).

MROH1 has also been identified as a candidate causal gene for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with significant associations found through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) (Obeidat2017Leveraging). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MROH1 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
