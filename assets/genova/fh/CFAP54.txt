# CFAP54

## Overview
The CFAP54 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 54, which is integral to the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella in mammals. This protein is a component of the C1d complex within the central microtubule apparatus, playing a critical role in regulating ciliary and flagellar motility, particularly in response to calcium signals (McKenzie2015CFAP54). CFAP54 is predominantly expressed in tissues with motile cilia, such as the testis, lung, and brain, where it is essential for maintaining normal ciliary function (McKenzie2015CFAP54). Deficiencies in CFAP54 can lead to structural defects in the C1d projection, resulting in conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by symptoms like hydrocephalus, male infertility, and impaired mucociliary clearance (McKenzie2015CFAP54). The protein's unique role in the assembly and function of the C1d projection underscores its importance in reproductive health and respiratory function (McKenzie2015CFAP54).

## Function
CFAP54 is a crucial protein for the proper assembly and function of motile cilia and flagella in mammals. It is a component of the C1d complex within the central microtubule apparatus of cilia, which is essential for regulating ciliary and flagellar motility, particularly in response to calcium signals (McKenzie2015CFAP54). CFAP54 is primarily expressed in motile ciliated tissues such as the testis, lung, and brain, where it plays a significant role in maintaining normal ciliary function (McKenzie2015CFAP54).

In the absence of CFAP54, the C1d projection of the central microtubule apparatus is structurally defective, leading to decreased ciliary beat frequency and impaired cilia-driven flow. This defect is associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) symptoms, such as hydrocephalus, male infertility, and mucus accumulation due to impaired mucociliary clearance (McKenzie2015CFAP54). CFAP54 is also involved in spermatogenesis, as its deficiency results in the absence of mature sperm flagella, highlighting its role in reproductive health (McKenzie2015CFAP54). The protein's function is not redundant with other proteins like CFAP221, indicating its unique role in the assembly and function of the C1d projection (McKenzie2015CFAP54).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP54 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by impaired motile cilia function. This condition can lead to a variety of symptoms, including hydrocephalus, male infertility, and mucus accumulation in the sinuses due to defects in ciliary motility and assembly (McKenzie2015CFAP54). The male infertility observed in CFAP54 mutant mice is attributed to defects in spermatogenesis, specifically during spermiogenesis, where the formation of mature sperm flagella is disrupted (McKenzie2020Genetic; McKenzie2015CFAP54).

In mouse models, the absence of the C1d projection in tracheal epithelial cilia results in decreased ciliary beat frequency, affecting mucociliary clearance and potentially contributing to respiratory issues (McKenzie2015CFAP54). Although no human mutations in CFAP54 have been identified yet, it is plausible that such mutations could be found in PCD patients without situs inversus, contributing to the genetic heterogeneity of the condition (McKenzie2015CFAP54). The severity of hydrocephalus in CFAP54 mutant mice is influenced by genetic background, indicating that genetic modifiers may play a role in the manifestation of this condition (McKenzie2015CFAP54; McKenzie2018Strainspecific).

## Interactions
CFAP54 is a component of the C1d projection within the central microtubule apparatus of motile cilia and flagella. It is part of a complex that includes other proteins such as FAP74, FAP46, and C1d-87/WDR93, which are involved in regulating flagellar motility in a calcium-dependent manner (McKenzie2015CFAP54; Zhao2019Proteome). CFAP54 interacts with the calcium-binding protein calmodulin to regulate dynein motor force, which is crucial for ciliary movement (McKenzie2015CFAP54). 

The protein is also associated with the C1a-e-c supercomplex, indicating strong interactions between the C1c and C1d projections (Fu2019Structural). CFAP54 is not functionally redundant with CFAP221, suggesting distinct roles in the assembly and function of the C1d projection (McKenzie2015CFAP54). 

In genetic studies, CFAP54 has shown significant interactions with other central pair apparatus genes, such as CFAP221 and SPEF2, in mouse models of primary ciliary dyskinesia. These interactions can lead to severe phenotypes when multiple genes are disrupted, highlighting the importance of CFAP54 in maintaining ciliary function (McKenzie2020Genetic). However, specific direct interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies.
