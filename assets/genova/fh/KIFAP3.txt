# KIFAP3

## Overview
KIFAP3, or kinesin-associated protein 3, is a gene that encodes a non-motor protein involved in intracellular transport processes. The protein KIFAP3 is a crucial component of the kinesin-2 complex, which facilitates the movement of various cellular cargos, including organelles and proteins, along microtubules. This protein is characterized by its 12 armadillo repeats, which are structural motifs that enable protein-protein interactions, allowing KIFAP3 to function as an adaptor linking the KIF3 motor complex to its cargo (Ichinose2019The). KIFAP3 is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it contributes to the construction of the axon initial segment and the maintenance of neuronal polarity. It also plays a role in the retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (Telikicherla2012Overexpression). The protein's interactions and modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for its function and regulation, impacting various cellular processes and disease mechanisms, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and basal cell carcinoma (Landers2009Reduced; Onodera2021Novel).

## Structure
KIFAP3, also known as kinesin-associated protein 3, is a protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport by interacting with kinesin motor proteins. The protein contains 12 armadillo (Arm) repeats, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Ichinose2019The). These repeats contribute to the secondary structure of KIFAP3, likely forming alpha helices that facilitate its function as an adaptor linking the KIF3 motor complex to its cargo (Ichinose2019The).

KIFAP3 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation. Specific phosphorylation sites on KAP3 include serine 60 (S60), which is phosphorylated by MARK2. This modification affects the protein's interaction with TRIM46, reducing its affinity in the somatodendritic region and preventing inappropriate transport to dendritic branches (Ichinose2019The). The phosphorylation of KAP3 is crucial for the spatiotemporal regulation of the KIF3/KAP3/TRIM46 complex at the axon initial segment (AIS) (Ichinose2019The).

The quaternary structure of KIFAP3 involves its interaction with other protein subunits, such as KIF3A and KIF3B, forming a heterotrimeric complex essential for microtubule organization and cargo transport in neurons (Ichinose2019The). This complex is vital for maintaining the polarized morphology of neurons and facilitating axon differentiation (Ichinose2019The).

## Function
KIFAP3, also known as kinesin associated protein 3, is a non-motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport by associating with the kinesin-2 complex. This complex is involved in the transport of various cargos, including organelles, nucleic acids, and proteins, within cells (Telikicherla2012Overexpression). KIFAP3 interacts with the tail domain of motor proteins KIF3A and KIF3B, facilitating their linkage to cargo, and is essential for the retrograde transport of COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Telikicherla2012Overexpression).

In neurons, KIFAP3 is part of the KIF3/KAP3/TRIM46 complex, which is critical for the construction of the axon initial segment (AIS) and axon/dendrite differentiation. This complex is involved in the polarized trafficking of AIS components, such as voltage-gated sodium channels, and is essential for maintaining proper microtubule orientation and neuronal polarity (Ichinose2019The). The phosphorylation of KIFAP3 by MARK2 kinase modulates its interaction with TRIM46, influencing the transport and localization of TRIM46 to the AIS, which is crucial for axon specification (Ichinose2019The).

KIFAP3 is localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and ER, and interacts with several other proteins, including Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) and c-Src. Phosphorylation by Src reduces KIFAP3's affinity for SmgGDS, a regulatory protein involved in GTP/GDP exchange in small G proteins (Telikicherla2012Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIFAP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and diabetic nephropathy (DN). In the context of BCC, significant mutations in KIFAP3, such as a frameshift mutation (2142delT), have been identified. These mutations are rare and potentially harmful, with CADD scores placing them in the top 0.1% of deleterious mutations. The study suggests that these mutations may disrupt ciliary function, which is crucial for Hedgehog signaling, a pathway involved in BCC development (Onodera2021Novel).

In diabetic nephropathy, the long non-coding RNA KIFAP3-5:1, associated with the KIFAP3 gene, is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is linked to increased renal fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that contribute to kidney damage in DN. KIFAP3-5:1 negatively regulates PRRX1, a gene involved in EMT, and its overexpression can ameliorate renal fibrosis and EMT in high glucose conditions. This suggests a protective role against renal damage in DN, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease severity and progression (Du2024LncRNA).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of KIFAP3 in both cancer and renal diseases, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and therapeutic potential.

## Interactions
KIFAP3, also known as kinesin-associated protein 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular transport. It forms part of a trimeric motor complex with kinesin motor proteins KIF3A and KIF3B, which is essential for chromosomal cytokinesis and anterograde transport (Landers2009Reduced). This complex is involved in the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as axonal transport and ciliary function.

KIFAP3 is also known to interact with mutant SOD1 protein, which is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This interaction may slow the axonal transport of choline acetyltransferase in motor neurons, suggesting a potential mechanism by which KIFAP3 influences ALS progression (Landers2009Reduced). The study by Landers et al. suggests that reduced expression of KIFAP3 could modulate survival in ALS by affecting the stoichiometry of the KIF3 complex and its transport functions (Landers2009Reduced).

In the context of basal cell carcinoma, KIFAP3 interacts with GLI proteins, which are part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Disruption of KIFAP3 in mice has been shown to lead to BCC-like neoplasia, indicating its significance in tumor development (Onodera2021Novel).
