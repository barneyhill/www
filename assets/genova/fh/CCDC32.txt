# CCDC32

## Overview
CCDC32 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 32 protein, which plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a fundamental cellular process for nutrient uptake and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The CCDC32 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates interactions with the AP2 adaptor complex, crucial for the stabilization and invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (Yang2024CCDC32). This protein is involved in the early stages of CCP formation and is essential for the proper uptake of cargo molecules, such as the transferrin receptor, which is vital for iron homeostasis (Yang2024CCDC32). Beyond its role in CME, CCDC32 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including interactions with viral proteins and components involved in monocyte activation (Allouch2009Identification; Li2011Yeast). Mutations in the CCDC32 gene have been associated with cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome and have potential implications in rheumatoid arthritis treatment and neuroblastoma (Lee2020Genomic; MESKO2012Peripheral; Yang2024CCDC32).

## Structure
CCDC32 is a small protein consisting of 185 amino acids and contains a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Yang2024CCDC32). The coiled-coil domain is located in the middle of the protein and facilitates interactions with the AP2 adaptor complex, essential for the stabilization and invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (Yang2024CCDC32). This domain is characterized by alpha-helical structures that wrap around each other in a superhelical fashion, typical of coiled-coil motifs (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

The protein's structure is predicted to be largely disordered, which may contribute to membrane curvature through molecular crowding (Yang2024CCDC32). A specific alpha-helical region (amino acids 78-98) is identified as the α-AD binding site, which is unique and does not match known AP2 α-AD binding motifs (Yang2024CCDC32). The coiled-coil domain is essential for CCDC32's recruitment to CCPs and its interaction with AP2, as demonstrated by the inability of a truncated version lacking this domain to bind AP2 effectively (Yang2024CCDC32). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
CCDC32 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a critical cellular process for nutrient uptake and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The CCDC32 protein stabilizes clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) and drives their invagination, which is essential for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (Yang2024CCDC32). CCDC32 is recruited early to CCPs and interacts with the α-appendage domain of the AP2 adaptor complex, a key player in CME. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and invagination of CCPs, facilitating the uptake of cargo molecules into cells (Yang2024CCDC32).

In healthy human cells, CCDC32 plays a significant role in the uptake of the transferrin receptor (TfnR), which is vital for iron homeostasis. Depletion of CCDC32 affects the formation and dynamics of CCPs, leading to larger, static clathrin-coated structures, although a subpopulation of dynamic CCPs remains (Yang2024CCDC32). Despite these changes, the overall efficiency of TfnR uptake is only marginally affected, suggesting compensatory mechanisms in CME (Yang2024CCDC32). CCDC32's role in CCP invagination is unique compared to other endocytic accessory proteins, as it does not follow typical phenotypes observed with other proteins (Yang2024CCDC32).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC32 gene have been linked to cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS), a condition characterized by a range of developmental abnormalities. Loss-of-function nonsense mutations in CCDC32 lead to premature termination and truncation of the protein, disrupting its interaction with the AP2 complex. This disruption inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), preventing the stabilization and invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which is crucial for normal cellular function (Yang2024CCDC32).

Alterations in CCDC32 expression have also been observed in the context of rheumatoid arthritis treatment. A study identified CCDC32 as one of the genes with significant expression changes between responders and nonresponders to tocilizumab treatment, suggesting its potential role as a marker for treatment response (MESKO2012Peripheral).

Additionally, a recurrent gene fusion involving CCDC32, specifically CCDC32-CBX3, has been identified in MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma, particularly in patients with ganglioneuroblastoma histology. This fusion may have implications for understanding the genomic landscape of neuroblastoma and developing targeted therapies (Lee2020Genomic).

## Interactions
CCDC32 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) through its interaction with the adaptor protein complex AP2. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). CCDC32 binds to the α-appendage domain of AP2 via its coiled-coil domain, facilitating its recruitment to CCPs and promoting their maturation. Knockdown of CCDC32 results in inhibited CCP invagination, as evidenced by an increase in flat clathrin-coated structures and a decrease in dome-shaped and spherical structures (Yang2024CCDC32).

CCDC32 also interacts with acetylated HIV-1 integrase (IN), as identified through a two-hybrid screening approach. This interaction suggests that CCDC32 may play a role in modulating the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, although the specific details of this interaction remain to be fully elucidated (Allouch2009Identification).

Additionally, CCDC32 has been identified as a protein interacting with the C-terminal fragment of annexin A2, a component involved in monocyte activation. This interaction was discovered using a yeast two-hybrid screening method, indicating CCDC32's potential involvement in various cellular processes beyond CME (Li2011Yeast).
