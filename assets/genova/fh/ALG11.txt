# ALG11

## Overview
The ALG11 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of N-glycans within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. This enzyme is part of the glycosyltransferase 1 family and is responsible for the addition of mannose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharides, a critical step in the assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides necessary for protein glycosylation (Rind2010A). The ALG11 protein's structure includes two transmembrane domains and a catalytic domain that facilitates the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to the oligosaccharide chain, impacting protein folding and stability (Rind2010A). Mutations in the ALG11 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its essential role in cellular homeostasis and development (Thiel2012Improved).

## Structure
The human ALG11 gene encodes the enzyme GDP-Man:Man3GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol mannosyltransferase, which is involved in the elongation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Rind2010A). The ALG11 enzyme is a transmembrane glycoprotein with two potential N-glycosylation sites and two transmembrane domains (Rind2010A). It belongs to the PFAM glycosyltransferase 1 group, which catalyzes the transfer of nucleotide-activated sugars (Rind2010A). The enzyme's structure includes two Rossmann-like type B domains separated by a flexible hinge region, where the catalytic site is located (Rind2010A). The C-terminus is responsible for nucleotide-sugar binding, while the N-terminus interacts with variable acceptor molecules (Rind2010A). The catalytic domain is expected to be cytosolic, and the enzyme's topology suggests that the second transmembrane domain may not span through but is embedded in the ER leaflet (Rind2010A). A mutation, p.L86S, located in a glycine-rich motif, affects the enzyme's function by altering a conserved leucine residue, which is crucial for its activity (Rind2010A).

## Function
The ALG11 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of N-glycans in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the addition of mannose residues to the growing oligosaccharide chain on the lipid carrier dolichol, specifically facilitating the elongation from Man3GlcNAc2-PP-Dol to Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. This process occurs on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for the proper assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which are critical for the glycosylation of proteins (Rind2010A; Thiel2012Improved).

In healthy human cells, ALG11 functions as a glycosyltransferase that sequentially adds two mannose residues to the growing oligosaccharide chain. This activity is vital for the synthesis of full-length oligosaccharides that are transferred to newly synthesized glycoproteins, affecting their folding, transport, biological activity, and stability (Rind2010A; Thiel2012Improved). The enzyme is predicted to be a transmembrane glycoprotein with its catalytic domain localized in the cytosol, where it facilitates the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to the dolichol-linked precursor oligosaccharide (Rind2010A). Proper function of ALG11 is essential for cellular homeostasis and organismal development, as defects in its activity can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (Thiel2012Improved).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG11 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ip. These disorders are characterized by a range of severe clinical manifestations, including developmental delays, neurological impairments, and multisystemic effects. Patients with ALG11-CDG often present with symptoms such as microcephaly, epilepsy, muscular hypotonia, and developmental retardation (Rind2010A; Haanpää2019ALG11‐CDG). 

The ALG11 gene encodes an enzyme crucial for the N-glycosylation process, and mutations can lead to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids. This results in the accumulation of truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharides, which disrupts normal cellular functions (Rind2010A; Mulkey2019Arrest). Specific mutations, such as p.L86S, have been identified as pathogenic, causing severe metabolic diseases with fatal outcomes in infancy (Rind2010A).

In some cases, patients with ALG11 mutations also exhibit autism spectrum disorder, suggesting a broader spectrum of neurological involvement (UzunyaylaInci2023Autism). The clinical phenotype of ALG11-CDG is expanding, with reports of novel mutations and varying symptoms, highlighting the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis (Haanpää2019ALG11‐CDG).

## Interactions
ALG11, an α1,2-mannosyltransferase, is involved in the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum. It participates in physical interactions with other mannosyltransferases, specifically Alg1 and Alg2, forming distinct oligomeric complexes. Alg1 is stably associated with both Alg2 and Alg11, but Alg2 and Alg11 do not interact directly with each other (Gao2004Physical). These interactions are crucial for the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursors, as they facilitate the addition of mannose residues to generate intermediates like Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (Xu2018Structural).

ALG11 does not self-assemble into homodimers, as evidenced by the lack of detectable self-assembled Alg11-HA in immunoprecipitation assays (Gao2004Physical). The protein's interactions with Alg1 and Alg2 suggest a model where Alg1 forms two separate complexes, one with Alg2 and another with Alg11, enhancing the efficiency of the glycosylation process by limiting substrate diffusion distances (Gao2004Physical). These interactions are essential for the proper function of the glycosylation pathway, as they ensure the rapid kinetics necessary for lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis (Gao2004Physical).
