# WRN

## Overview
The WRN gene encodes the WRN RecQ like helicase, a crucial enzyme belonging to the RecQ family of DNA helicases. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA repair, replication, recombination, and telomere maintenance. The WRN protein is characterized by its helicase and exonuclease domains, which facilitate the unwinding and processing of DNA structures, essential for resolving complex DNA configurations such as forks and Holliday junctions (Kitano2014Structural; Rossi2010Roles). Mutations in the WRN gene are linked to Werner syndrome, a disorder marked by premature aging and increased cancer risk, underscoring the protein's importance in cellular health and longevity (Huang2006The; Yokote2016WRNMutation).

## Structure
The WRN gene encodes the Werner syndrome protein, a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and maintenance. The primary structure of WRN includes a helicase domain and an exonuclease domain, with the helicase domain being essential for its function in DNA strand separation and repair (Kitano2014Structural; Newman2020Structure). 

The secondary structure of WRN features alpha helices and beta sheets, with specific domains such as the RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domain folding into a winged-helix motif. This motif is involved in recognizing and unwinding DNA at branch points (Kitano2014Structural; Kitano2010Structural). The HRDC domain, another significant component, is composed of five α-helices and one 3_10-helix, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Kitano2007Crystal).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a compact arrangement, with unique features such as a β-hairpin in the helicase domain and a helical hairpin in the Zn2+ binding domain, which may aid in binding alternative DNA structures (Newman2020Structure). 

Post-translational modifications of WRN include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity. Splice variants of WRN can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function in DNA repair processes (Kitano2014Structural).

## Function
The WRN gene encodes the Werner syndrome protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability in healthy human cells. WRN is involved in several key molecular processes, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, and telomere maintenance. It possesses ATP-dependent helicase, exonuclease, and single-stranded DNA annealing activities, essential for resolving various DNA structures such as forks, flaps, displacement loops, bubbles, Holliday junctions, and G-quadruplexes (Rossi2010Roles).

WRN is active in the nucleus, particularly at sites of DNA damage, where it participates in multiple DNA repair pathways, including base excision repair (BER), homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). It interacts with several proteins involved in these pathways, such as DNA Polymerase β, FEN1, and Rad51, enhancing DNA repair efficiency and maintaining genomic stability (Brosh2007Human; Rossi2010Roles).

In telomere maintenance, WRN interacts with telomeric structures and proteins like TRF1 and TRF2, contributing to telomere replication and stability. Its helicase activity is crucial for unwinding telomeric DNA structures, preventing replication stalling, and facilitating the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway (Brosh2007Human; Rossi2010Roles). These functions are vital for cellular health and longevity, with deficiencies in WRN leading to premature aging phenotypes, as seen in Werner syndrome (Rossi2010Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WRN gene are primarily associated with Werner syndrome (WS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by features of accelerated aging. Patients with WS typically exhibit symptoms such as premature graying and loss of hair, bilateral ocular cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, and an increased risk of various cancers, including sarcomas, thyroid carcinoma, and melanoma (Huang2006The; Yokote2016WRNMutation). The median age of death for WS patients is around 54 years, often due to cancer or cardiovascular disease (Huang2006The).

The WRN gene encodes a DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and replication. Mutations often result in the loss of the nuclear localization signal, impairing the protein's function and leading to genomic instability (Chun2010Werner). These mutations include nonsense mutations, insertions/deletions, and splice junction substitutions, affecting various domains of the WRN protein (Huang2006The).

WRN gene variants have also been linked to other age-related diseases and conditions. For instance, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the WRN gene are associated with increased risks of cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer, often influenced by environmental factors like smoking and alcohol consumption (Lebel2018Werner). Additionally, WRN SNPs have been associated with cardiovascular diseases, cognitive function, and neurodegenerative conditions (Lebel2018Werner; Lautrup2019Studying).

## Interactions
The WRN protein, encoded by the WRN gene, is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases and is involved in various protein interactions crucial for DNA metabolism. WRN physically interacts with DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), enhancing its polymerization activity, particularly in the absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction is specific to pol δ and requires the Pol32p subunit, indicating a role in replication restart at blocked forks rather than normal DNA synthesis (KamathLoeb2000Functional).

WRN also interacts with human replication protein A (hRPA), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein. This interaction is essential for WRN helicase activity on long DNA duplexes, suggesting a functional partnership in DNA replication, recombination, and repair processes. hRPA enhances the processivity of WRN helicase, although it does not increase ATP hydrolysis efficiency (Brosh1999Functional).

Proteome-wide studies have identified several other WRN-interacting proteins, including DNA-PK, KU70, KU80, and PARP-1, which are involved in DNA repair pathways. These interactions suggest WRN's role in genome maintenance and DNA damage response (Lachapelle2011Proteome-wide). Additionally, WRN interacts with RPS3, a ribosomal protein involved in oxidative DNA damage recognition, indicating a potential role in DNA repair (Lachapelle2011Proteome-wide).
