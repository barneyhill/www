# SCLY

## Overview
The SCLY gene encodes the enzyme selenocysteine lyase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in selenium metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a lyase and is primarily involved in the decomposition of selenocysteine into alanine and selenide, facilitating the recycling of selenium for selenoprotein synthesis. Selenocysteine lyase functions as a homodimer and is highly conserved across species, with significant expression in the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to antioxidant defense and redox homeostasis (KUROKAWA2011Mammalian; Seale2019Selenocysteine). The enzyme's activity is detected in various subcellular compartments, including the cytosol and mitochondria, although its precise nuclear role remains unclear (Seale2019Selenocysteine). Beyond its role in selenium metabolism, SCLY is implicated in energy metabolism, with its absence linked to metabolic disturbances such as obesity and insulin resistance, particularly in a sex-dependent manner (OgawaWong2018Sexual; Seale2019Selenocysteine).

## Structure
Selenocysteine lyase (SCLY) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer, with each subunit contributing to the formation of two active site cavities at the subunit interface. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 93,000 in pigs and is highly conserved across various animal species, including humans (Seale2019Selenocysteine). The active site of SCLY is specifically designed to bind L-selenocysteine, facilitated by a critical cysteine residue (Cys388 in humans) that forms a selenoato-thiol interaction and a Schiff base with PLP, leading to the production of protonated aldimine (Seale2019Selenocysteine).

The enzyme's specificity is further influenced by an aspartate residue (Asp146) and a histidine residue (His389), which are crucial for substrate specificity (Seale2019Selenocysteine). The crystal structure of SCLY reveals an extended lobe that becomes ordered in the presence of a ligand, indicating a dynamic structural adaptation upon substrate binding (Seale2019Selenocysteine). SCLY's subcellular localization is debated, with evidence of its presence in the cytosol, mitochondria, microsomes, and nucleus (Seale2019Selenocysteine). The enzyme was first purified from pig liver and is expressed in various mammalian tissues, with the highest expression in the liver (Seale2019Selenocysteine).

## Function
The SCLY gene encodes the enzyme selenocysteine lyase, which plays a critical role in selenium metabolism by catalyzing the decomposition of selenocysteine into alanine and selenide. This process is essential for recycling selenium, which is then used for the synthesis of selenoproteins, crucial for various cellular functions, including antioxidant defense and redox homeostasis (KUROKAWA2011Mammalian; Seale2019Selenocysteine). SCLY operates primarily in the liver and kidneys, where it is highly expressed, indicating its significant role in these organs (Seale2019Selenocysteine).

The enzyme functions as a homodimer and requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a cofactor. It is involved in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins by providing selenide to selenophosphate synthetase enzymes, which are necessary for the synthesis and charging of selenocysteine to its specific tRNA (Seale2019Selenocysteine). SCLY's activity is detected in various subcellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus, although its nuclear role remains unclear (Seale2019Selenocysteine).

In addition to its role in selenium metabolism, SCLY is implicated in energy metabolism, particularly in the liver, where its absence can lead to metabolic disturbances such as obesity and insulin resistance (Seale2019Selenocysteine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SCLY gene, which encodes the enzyme selenocysteine lyase, have been linked to several metabolic disorders. In mice, the knockout of SCLY results in obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance, with these effects being more pronounced in males, indicating a sex-dependent role in energy metabolism (OgawaWong2018Sexual; Seale2019Selenocysteine). The absence of SCLY affects the hypothalamic synthesis of selenoproteins, which are crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, leading to a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype (Seale2019Selenocysteine; Torres2019AgrpSpecific).

SCLY's role in selenium metabolism is significant, as selenium is essential for selenoprotein synthesis. Disruption of SCLY can lead to reduced expression of selenoproteins in the hypothalamus, contributing to conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes due to impaired energy regulation and leptin signaling (OgawaWong2018Sexual; Torres2019AgrpSpecific). In addition, SCLY knockout mice exhibit increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and obesity when fed a high-fat diet, highlighting the enzyme's role in managing oxidative stress and metabolic health (Watanabe2021Effect). These findings suggest that SCLY is crucial for coordinating selenium and energy metabolism, with potential implications for metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
Selenocysteine lyase (SCLY) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of selenium metabolism. SCLY interacts with selenophosphate synthetase enzymes, SEPHS1 and SEPHS2, to facilitate the transfer of selenide for selenoprotein biosynthesis. This interaction has been demonstrated in vitro, highlighting SCLY's role in the recycling of selenocysteine (Seale2019Selenocysteine). 

In Trypanosoma brucei, the homologous enzyme TbSCLY forms a binary hetero-complex with TbSEPHS2, as confirmed by techniques such as SEC-MALS and isothermal titration calorimetry. This interaction involves the N-terminal region of TbSEPHS2, although it does not appear to form stable complexes with other components of the selenocysteine pathway (da2020Trypanosomatid).

SCLY also interacts with proteins involved in metabolism, as shown in yeast two-hybrid screening studies using mouse Scly as bait. These interactions include proteins such as major urinary proteins, aldehyde reductase, and ATP synthase A, although most have not been validated in vitro or in vivo (Seale2019Selenocysteine). These findings suggest that SCLY may participate in additional functional pathways beyond its established roles in selenium metabolism.
