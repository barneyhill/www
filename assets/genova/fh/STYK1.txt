# STYK1

## Overview
STYK1, or serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and cancer progression. The protein product of STYK1 is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the regulation of autophagy, where it enhances the assembly of the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PtdIns3K-C1), independent of the central modulators AMPK and MTOR (Zhou2019STYK1). STYK1's interactions with proteins such as ATG14, BECN1, and PIK3C3 facilitate autophagosome formation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhou2019STYK1). Additionally, STYK1 is implicated in cancer, where its expression is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Lai2021STYK1NOK; NIRASAWA2014Significance).

## Structure


## Function
STYK1 (serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1) is a protein kinase that plays a significant role in the regulation of autophagy, a crucial cellular process for maintaining homeostasis by degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, STYK1 enhances the assembly of the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PtdIns3K-C1), which is essential for autophagosome formation (Zhou2019STYK1). STYK1 interacts with key proteins such as ATG14, BECN1, and PIK3C3, promoting the phosphorylation of BECN1 at Ser90, a modification crucial for autophagy induction (Zhou2019STYK1). 

STYK1's role in autophagy is independent of the central modulators AMPK and MTOR, suggesting it regulates autophagy through a unique pathway (Zhou2019STYK1). The transmembrane domain of STYK1 is important for its localization and function in autophagy initiation, and its loss leads to impaired autophagy and altered protein distribution (Zhou2019STYK1). STYK1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the assembly and activity of the PtdIns3K-C1 complex through phosphorylation events, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhou2019STYK1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STYK1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and acute leukemia. In NSCLC, STYK1 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing FoxO1 signaling (Lai2021STYK1NOK). This overexpression is associated with increased migration and invasion of cancer cells, making STYK1 a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Lai2021STYK1NOK).

In HCC, STYK1 acts as an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to larger tumor size, vascular invasion, and higher tumor-nodule-metastasis (TNM) stage. It promotes EMT and tumor metastasis through the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, leading to poor overall and disease-free survival (Wang2016STYK1).

In acute leukemia, STYK1 is associated with drug resistance, reducing sensitivity to anticancer drugs by inhibiting caspase activity and altering cell cycle progression. Its expression is higher in non-responsive patients, suggesting its role as a biomarker for therapeutic outcomes (NIRASAWA2014Significance).

## Interactions
STYK1 (serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes such as autophagy and cancer progression. STYK1 interacts with components of the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PtdIns3K-C1), including PIK3C3, BECN1, ATG14, and PIK3R4, but not with RUBCN. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and activity of the complex, which is important for autophagy initiation (Zhou2019STYK1). STYK1 also interacts with RACK1 and NRBF2, which are important for the assembly of the PtdIns3K-C1 complex (Zhou2019STYK1).

In the context of cancer, STYK1 interacts with mutant EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, colocalizing at the plasma membrane and in perinuclear vesicles. This interaction is disrupted by EGFR inhibitors such as afatinib and osimertinib (Eggermont2022The). STYK1 also interacts with fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), a downstream effector, and its expression is associated with drug tolerance mechanisms in NSCLC cells (Eggermont2022The). These interactions highlight STYK1's role in modulating cellular responses to external signals and its potential as a therapeutic target.
