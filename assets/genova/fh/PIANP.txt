# PIANP

## Overview
PIANP (PILR alpha associated neural protein) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in both neural and immune functions. The protein encoded by PIANP is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in modulating synaptic transmission and maintaining neuronal balance through its interaction with the GABA_B receptor complex (Winkler2019Pianp). Additionally, PIANP is implicated in immune regulation by interacting with the immune inhibitory receptor PILRα, a process that is dependent on specific glycosylation for effective receptor-ligand binding (Evdokimov2016Leda1Pianp; Evdokimov2013Proteolytic). Alterations in PIANP expression or function have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Winkler2019Pianp).

## Function
PIANP (PILR alpha associated neural protein) is a type-I transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal function and immune regulation. In healthy human cells, PIANP is involved in presynaptic GABA_B receptor (GBR) inhibition, which is essential for modulating neurotransmitter release and maintaining synaptic balance (Winkler2019Pianp). It interacts with the GB1a subunit of the GBR complex, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum (Winkler2019Pianp).

PIANP also interacts with the immune inhibitory receptor PILRα, suggesting a role in immune regulation within neural tissues (Evdokimov2013Proteolytic). This interaction is dependent on specific glycosylation processes, which are necessary for proper receptor-ligand binding and subsequent immune modulation (Evdokimov2016Leda1Pianp). PIANP's involvement in these molecular processes contributes to maintaining neuronal cell composition and function, potentially influencing behaviors related to autism spectrum disorders when deficient (Winkler2019Pianp). Its expression in lymphoid organs and bone marrow-derived macrophages further indicates a role in immune surveillance and regulation (Winkler2019Pianp).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PIANP gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A case study involving a boy with a homozygous nonsense variant in PIANP showed global developmental delay, suggesting a role for PIANP in behavioral traits and neurodevelopmental conditions (Winkler2019Pianp). In mice, PIANP deficiency leads to changes in the hippocampus and cerebellum, including reduced numbers of Purkinje cells and altered neuronal cell composition, which are associated with ASD-like behaviors such as enhanced anxiety, spatial learning deficits, and impaired social interactions (Winkler2019Pianp).

PIANP interacts with the GABA B receptor (GBR) complex, and its deficiency impairs presynaptic GBR-mediated inhibition of glutamate release, which is significant because GBR activation has been shown to improve ASD symptoms in various models (Winkler2019Pianp). The downregulation of the autism-related gene Erdr1 in Pianp-deficient mice further supports the link between PIANP and ASD-like behaviors (Winkler2019Pianp). These findings suggest that PIANP mutations or expression changes could be clinically significant in ASD and related intellectual disabilities (Winkler2019Pianp).

## Interactions
PIANP (PILR alpha associated neural protein) is a type I transmembrane protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a role in both immune and neural processes. One of its primary interactions is with the immune inhibitory receptor PILRα (Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha). This interaction is significant in modulating immune responses, as PILRα acts as an inhibitory receptor predominantly expressed in myeloid cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Biswas2015Counterregulation; Evdokimov2013Proteolytic). The binding of PIANP to PILRα requires sialidation, which is crucial for the receptor-ligand interaction (Evdokimov2013Proteolytic).

PIANP also interacts with the GB1a subunit of the GABA B receptor (GBR) complex, influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling. This interaction is implicated in autism-like behaviors, as evidenced by studies on PIANP-deficient mice, which show altered GBR-mediated inhibition of glutamate release (Winkler2019Pianp). These interactions suggest that PIANP plays a role in both immune regulation and neural function, potentially linking it to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (Winkler2019Pianp).
