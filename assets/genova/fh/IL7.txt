# IL7

## Overview
The IL7 gene encodes the cytokine interleukin 7 (IL-7), a pivotal protein in the immune system that primarily influences the development and maintenance of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. As a member of the cytokine family, IL-7 is characterized by its four-helix bundle structure, which is typical of gamma chain interleukins (walsh2012structural; McElroy2009Structural). IL-7 is produced by stromal cells in the bone marrow and thymus and functions through its receptor, IL-7R, a heterodimeric complex that includes a unique alpha chain and a common gamma chain. This interaction is crucial for the activation of signaling pathways that promote cell survival and proliferation, particularly through the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways (Mazzucchelli2007Interleukin-7; Chen2021Interleukin7). Dysregulation of IL7 or its receptor can lead to immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Puel1998Defective; Marković2020Modulation).

## Structure
Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is a cytokine characterized by a four-helix bundle topology with an up-up-down-down arrangement, which is common among gamma chain interleukins (walsh2012structural; McElroy2009Structural). The primary structure of IL-7 consists of 152 amino acid residues, with three disulfide bonds formed by six cysteine residues, contributing to its stability (Wickham2007Crystallization; Vandooren2021Internal). 

The secondary structure includes alpha helices labeled A through D, varying in length from 13 to 22 residues. A unique feature is a pi helix turn from T12 to M17 in helix A, which is crucial for stabilizing the IL-7/IL-7Ra interaction (McElroy2009Structural). The tertiary structure of IL-7 is compact, with a hydrophobic core that includes buried residues such as W142, which plays a critical role in the protein's folding and function (McElroy2009Structural).

IL-7 does not form a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. Glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification that influences IL-7's stability and interaction with its receptor, IL-7Ra, affecting binding affinity and resistance to proteolytic cleavage (McElroy2009Structural; Vandooren2021Internal). The IL-7 receptor, IL-7Ra, features an L-shaped architecture with fibronectin type III domains, contributing to the cytokine's signaling mechanism (walsh2012structural).

## Function
Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that plays a critical role in the development and homeostasis of immune cells, particularly T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. IL-7 is produced by various cells, including stromal cells in the bone marrow and thymus, and functions through its receptor IL-7R, a heterodimeric complex. The IL-7 signaling pathway involves Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK3, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the activation of STAT5, which acts as a transcription factor for target genes. This signaling promotes the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules like Bcl-2, enhancing cell survival by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Mazzucchelli2007Interleukin-7; Chen2021Interleukin7).

IL-7 is essential for T-cell development, particularly in early thymic progenitors and double-negative thymocytes, and is crucial for maintaining glucose metabolism in T cells, enhancing glucose uptake and glycolysis (Chen2021Interleukin7). In B cells, IL-7 influences survival by modulating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors and is involved in the pathogenesis of certain lymphomas and leukemias (Chen2021Interleukin7). IL-7 also regulates the homeostasis of NK cells and is involved in the development of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (Chen2021Interleukin7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IL7 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is one such condition, characterized by defects in T, B, and NK cell development. Mutations in the IL7R gene, which encodes the IL-7 receptor, can lead to SCID with a T-B+NK+ phenotype, where T and NK cells are absent, but B cells are present (Puel1998Defective; Engelhardt2016Identification). 

In autoimmune diseases, overexpression of IL-7 and its receptor is observed in conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary Sjögren's syndrome, correlating with disease severity (Marković2020Modulation). The IL7R polymorphism T244I is associated with increased susceptibility to MS, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, potentially due to altered IL-7 signaling and immune responses (Mazzucchelli2012The; Jäger2013IL7RA).

In cancer, IL-7 signaling is implicated in the proliferation of acute leukemia cells and is linked to relapse in pediatric B-ALL. Gain-of-function mutations in the IL7Rα gene are found in subsets of BCP-ALL and T-ALL patients, leading to constitutive receptor activation and increased IL-7 response, which are associated with poor prognosis (Wang2022The; Marković2020Modulation).

## Interactions
Interleukin 7 (IL-7) interacts with its receptor, IL-7R, which is composed of a unique alpha chain (IL-7Rα) and a common gamma chain (γc) shared with other cytokine receptors such as IL-2 and IL-4 (Venkitaraman1994Interleukin‐7; Noguchi1993Interleukin-2). The interaction between IL-7 and IL-7R is crucial for the formation of a signaling complex that involves the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) to the IL-7Rα chain. This recruitment is mediated by the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, creating a binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (Venkitaraman1994Interleukin‐7).

IL-7 also influences the structural and functional dynamics of the IL-7/IL-7Rα complex. Glycosylation of IL-7Rα significantly enhances the binding affinity of IL-7, primarily by increasing the association rate, although the glycosylation sites do not directly participate in the binding interface (walsh2012structural; McElroy2009Structural). The IL-7/IL-7Rα interaction is characterized by a relatively small buried surface area and involves predominantly hydrophobic interactions (McElroy2009Structural). These interactions are essential for the proper signaling and function of IL-7 in immune cell development and homeostasis.
