# ITGA5

## Overview
The ITGA5 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 5, a critical component of the integrin α5β1 heterodimer, which functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. This gene plays a pivotal role in mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), influencing various cellular processes essential for tissue development and repair (Wang2018Priminga). The integrin α5β1 receptor, formed by the pairing of ITGA5 with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), is particularly significant in the context of osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation, as well as in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endodermal cells (Wang2018Priming; Brafman2012Regulation). Aberrant expression of ITGA5 has been implicated in several cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pantano2021Integrin; Li2022ITGA5).

## Function
Integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) is a subunit of the integrin α5β1 heterodimer, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. ITGA5 is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, which are essential for maintaining cellular functions and promoting differentiation in healthy human cells (Wang2018Priminga). The protein is active in the ECM and influences tissue development and repair by mediating interactions between cells and the ECM, facilitating processes such as osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation (Wang2018Priminga; Wang2018Priming).

In the context of osteogenic differentiation, ITGA5 expression enhances the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic capacity of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) by activating signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MEK1/2/ERK1/2 (Wang2018Priming). Similarly, in odontogenic differentiation, ITGA5 promotes extracellular matrix deposition and receptor activity, which are crucial for the differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) (Wang2018Priminga).

ITGA5 also plays a role in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endodermal cells, where it facilitates interaction with fibronectin and vitronectin, promoting differentiation into definitive endoderm (Brafman2012Regulation). These integrin-ECM interactions are vital during early human development and contribute to the regulation of cell differentiation (Brafman2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITGA5 gene, which encodes the integrin alpha 5 subunit, have been implicated in various cancers. In gliomas, high ITGA5 expression is associated with aggressive clinicopathological features, poor survival outcomes, and a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. It correlates with increased tumor-associated macrophages and immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting potential for ITGA5-targeted therapies in combination with immunotherapy (Li2022ITGA5).

In breast cancer, ITGA5 is linked to bone metastasis. High expression levels in primary tumors are associated with a higher risk of bone metastasis and poor bone metastasis-free survival. ITGA5 promotes breast cancer cell adhesion, invasion, and survival, and its inhibition reduces bone metastasis formation (Pantano2021Integrin).

In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), ITGA5 is a downstream target of mTORC1 signaling and is associated with tumor proliferation, migration, and metastasis. Its depletion increases sensitivity to chemotherapy, suggesting ITGA5 as a potential therapeutic target (Li2022Elevated).

In pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms, high ITGA5 expression correlates with disease progression and lower survival rates, indicating its potential role in metastasis risk (Prieto2021The).

## Interactions
ITGA5, or integrin subunit alpha 5, is known for its role in forming the fibronectin receptor by pairing with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1). This receptor is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling processes. ITGA5 interacts with several proteins, including fibronectin, talin, and kindlin, which are essential for cell migration, proliferation, and survival. In the context of cancer, ITGA5 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in the Src/Vav2/Rac1 pathway, which is significant for cell migration and metastasis. Specifically, ITGA5 down-regulation affects the interaction between the Rac-GEF Vav2 and Rac1, inhibiting Rac1 activation, a process mediated through the Src/Vav2/Rac1 pathway (Xiao2018Integrin).

In the context of odontogenic differentiation, ITGA5 is involved in interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as SPARC, LUM, and various collagen types. These interactions are part of the ECM-receptor pathways that are crucial for the differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (Wang2018Priming). ITGA5 also plays a role in the integrin-mediated signaling pathway, which includes interactions with other integrin members like αVβ3, amplifying signaling cascades necessary for cellular processes (Wang2018Priming).
