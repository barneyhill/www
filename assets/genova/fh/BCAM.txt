# BCAM

## Overview
The BCAM gene encodes the basal cell adhesion molecule, also known as the Lutheran blood group glycoprotein, which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion, motility, and migration, playing a significant role in various physiological and pathological processes. BCAM is characterized by its five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate interactions with extracellular matrix components such as laminin, and intracellular interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. These interactions are crucial for cellular adhesion and signal transduction. The protein exists in multiple isoforms, differing in their cytoplasmic domains, which influence their functional roles. BCAM's expression and function are implicated in several diseases, including cancer and hematological disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Jin2024The; Collec2011Novel; Zhao2022Integrated).

## Structure
The BCAM protein, also known as the Lutheran blood group glycoprotein, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its structure comprising five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains. These domains include two variable-type and three constant-type domains, which contribute to its role in cell adhesion (Jin2024The). The protein exists in two isoforms, Lu and Lu(v13), which differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domains, with Lu having a longer cytoplasmic tail of 59 amino acids compared to 19 in Lu(v13) (Collec2011Novel). 

BCAM is a single transmembrane glycoprotein, and its extracellular domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as laminin and the Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1). Domain 2 of BCAM is particularly important for binding to CNF1 (Reppin2017High). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with four N-glycosylation sites accounting for approximately 15% of its weight. However, glycosylation is not necessary for CNF1 binding, as the interaction persists even with deglycosylated BCAM (Piteau2014LuBCAM). 

The intracellular region of BCAM contains phosphorylation sites and an SH3 binding motif, indicating its involvement in receptor signaling and cytoskeletal interactions (Collec2011Novel).

## Function
BCAM, also known as the Lutheran blood group glycoprotein, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, motility, migration, and invasion. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and is widely expressed in various cell types, including red blood cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells (Jin2024The). BCAM functions as a receptor for laminin, an extracellular matrix protein, facilitating interactions that influence cell adhesion and migration (Jin2024The).

The extracellular domain of BCAM consists of five immunoglobulin superfamily domains, which enable interactions with laminin, integrin, or other ligands. These interactions are critical for cellular processes such as adhesion and migration (Jin2024The). The intracellular region of BCAM can interact with cytoskeletal proteins, such as hemoglobin, to mediate cellular signal transduction (Jin2024The). BCAM is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly through its interaction with spectrin and the RhoA small GTP-binding protein, which promotes stress fiber formation (Jin2024The).

BCAM's role in cell adhesion is also linked to its phosphorylation, which is crucial for its adhesion to laminin. This process is enhanced by epinephrine through β2 adrenergic receptors and the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway (Jin2024The). BCAM's expression and function are regulated by various molecular interactions and signaling pathways, highlighting its complex role in cell biology (Jin2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BCAM gene, also known as the basal cell adhesion molecule, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), BCAM expression is downregulated, which is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters and poor prognosis. This downregulation is linked to higher immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a potential better response to immunotherapy in patients with low BCAM expression (Zhao2022Integrated). The study also indicates that BCAM expression is regulated by epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, and is associated with BAP1 mutation status, which correlates with worse prognosis (Zhao2022Integrated).

In gastric cancer, BCAM is upregulated and associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. Knockdown of BCAM in gastric cancer cell lines significantly reduces cell migration and invasion, highlighting its role in promoting cancer progression (Jin2020Upregulation).

BCAM is also involved in hematological diseases such as sickle cell anemia, where its increased expression on red blood cells contributes to enhanced adhesion to laminin, affecting blood flow and leading to vascular obstructions (Jin2024The). In skin tumors, BCAM expression is upregulated, particularly in epithelial-origin tumors, and is suggested to play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis (Schön2000BasalCell).

## Interactions
BCAM, also known as the basal cell adhesion molecule or Lutheran blood group, participates in several significant protein interactions. It interacts with the Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), serving as a receptor that facilitates the toxin's binding and uptake into cells. This interaction is characterized by high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K_D) of 2.8 nM, and is crucial for CNF1's pathogenic effects, such as actin stress fiber induction and epithelial barrier disruption (Piteau2014LuBCAM; Reppin2017High).

BCAM also interacts with spectrin, a key component of the membrane cytoskeleton. This interaction is important for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and stress fiber formation, particularly in epithelial cells. The Lu/BCAM-spectrin interaction involves the RK573-574 motif and is part of a signaling pathway that activates RhoA, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal regulation (Collec2011Novel).

In erythrocytes, BCAM interacts with laminin-a5, a component of the extracellular matrix. This interaction is regulated by the sialylation of glycophorin-C, which modulates BCAM's adhesive capacity. The loss of sialic acid during erythrocyte aging enhances BCAM's binding to laminin-a5, a process that is particularly relevant in sickle cell disease (Klei2018GlycophorinC).
