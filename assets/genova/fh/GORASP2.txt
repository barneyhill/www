# GORASP2

## Overview
GORASP2 is a gene that encodes the Golgi reassembly stacking protein 2, commonly referred to as GRASP55, which is a critical component of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining the organization and function of the Golgi stacks. GRASP55 is involved in the formation and stabilization of the Golgi ribbon, a structure essential for efficient protein trafficking and processing within the cell (Zhang2020Nonredundant; Bekier2017Knockout). The protein contains two PDZ domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for its function in Golgi stack formation and unconventional protein secretion (Mendes2020The). Additionally, GRASP55 is implicated in autophagy, where it aids in the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, thus playing a role in cellular homeostasis (Zhang2020Nonredundant). The activity of GRASP55 is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its oligomerization and function during the cell cycle (Zhang2020Nonredundant). Alterations in GORASP2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Husni2019DNA).

## Structure
The GORASP2 protein, also known as Golgi reassembly stacking protein 2, is characterized by its structural biophysics, which includes several domains and a high degree of intrinsic disorder. It contains two PDZ domains, PDZ1 and PDZ2, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. These domains share a sequence identity of 30-40% and exhibit a high degree of structural conservation. PDZ1 is involved in canonical interactions with Golgins, while PDZ2 provides secondary contacts and can undergo significant reorientation upon binding (Mendes2020The).

The GRASP domain, also known as DGRASP, is conserved across eukaryotes and consists of two PDZ sub-domains connected in tandem. The structure of the human GRASP55 GRASP domain was determined using protein crystallography, revealing an unusual PDZ fold with a circular permutation of the first two β-strands (Mendes2020The).

The SPR domain of GORASP2 is highly disordered and contains multiple phosphorylation sites, impacting oligomerization and membrane anchoring. This domain is rich in serine and proline, which are disorder-promoting residues, and plays a significant role in GRASP function by potentially controlling structural changes (Mendes2020The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influences its function during the cell cycle (Mendes2020The).

## Function
GORASP2, also known as GRASP55, is a crucial protein involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. It plays a significant role in Golgi stack formation and organization, which is essential for proper protein trafficking and glycosylation (Zhang2020Nonredundant; Bekier2017Knockout). GRASP55 forms trans-oligomers that tether adjacent Golgi membranes into stacks, contributing to the Golgi's ribbon-like structure (Zhang2020Nonredundant). This structural organization is vital for the Golgi's role in the exocytic pathway, including protein and lipid processing (Zhang2020Nonredundant).

GRASP55 is also involved in unconventional protein secretion and autophagy, particularly under stress or pathological conditions (Zhang2020Nonredundant). It facilitates the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, playing a role in cellular homeostasis (Zhang2020Nonredundant). Additionally, GRASP55 is active in the Golgi membrane, where it interacts with other Golgi structural proteins to regulate Golgi morphology and function (Bekier2017Knockout). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its oligomerization and function during cell cycle progression (Zhang2020Nonredundant).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GORASP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, GORASP2 is significantly hypomethylated and overexpressed in invasive adenocarcinoma compared to adenocarcinoma in situ and normal lung tissue. This overexpression is associated with poor patient outcomes, suggesting that GORASP2 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for this type of cancer (Husni2019DNA). The study indicates that targeting GORASP2 might be a potential therapeutic strategy due to its role in tumor progression (Husni2019DNA).

In the context of breast cancer, a study identified a somatic variant of GORASP2, V364M, in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This mutation was detected at the proteome level and is reported in the COSMIC database, highlighting its potential relevance in cancer genomics (Dimitrakopoulos2019Proteomewide).

GORASP2 also plays a role in myometrial contractility during labor. Its knockdown in human myometrial smooth muscle cells leads to reduced cell contractility, impaired energy metabolism, and increased reactive oxygen species, suggesting its importance in maintaining myometrial function during labor (Yang2023Golgi).

## Interactions
GORASP2, also known as GRASP55, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in the Golgi apparatus. It interacts with Golgin45, which is essential for anchoring Golgin45 to the Golgi and maintaining the integrity of the Golgi ribbon (Mendes2022Resurrecting). GRASP55 also forms trans-oligomers through its N-terminal GRASP domain, which contains two PDZ domains, allowing it to interact with Golgi receptors such as Golgin-45 (Zhang2020Nonredundant).

GRASP55 undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation and deacetylation, which influence its interactions. SIRT2, a deacetylase, interacts with GRASP55, modulating its acetylation status and affecting its self-interaction efficiency, which is crucial for Golgi structure formation (Zhang2019SIRT2). GRASP55 also interacts with proteins involved in unconventional protein secretion pathways, such as Sec16A, and is implicated in the trafficking of the ΔF508-CFTR protein under stress conditions (Zhang2020Nonredundant).

In the context of autophagy, GORASP2 interacts with lipidated LC3 on autophagosomes and LAMP2 on lysosomes, facilitating their fusion, which is crucial for autophagosome maturation (Zhang2018The). These interactions highlight GORASP2's role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, as well as its involvement in cellular stress responses.
