# IL7R

## Overview
The IL7R gene encodes the interleukin-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Rα), a critical component of the immune system that functions as a type I transmembrane receptor. This receptor is primarily involved in the development and homeostasis of lymphocytes, particularly T and B cells. IL-7Rα forms a heterodimer with the common gamma chain (γc) to mediate signaling pathways essential for lymphocyte survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The receptor's structure includes an extracellular domain with fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which collectively facilitate its role in cytokine signaling (Walsh2012Structural; McElroy2009Structural). The IL7R gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various clinical conditions, including severe combined immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, and certain cancers, underscoring their significance in both health and disease (Lundmark2007Variation; Gianfelici2018IL7R).

## Structure
The IL7R gene encodes the interleukin-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Rα), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein crucial for lymphocyte development. The receptor consists of an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The ECD belongs to the cytokine receptor homology class 1 (CRH1) family and contains two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, D1 and D2, connected by a 3 10-helical linker, forming an L-shaped architecture (Walsh2012Structural; Wickham2007Crystallization). The D1 domain includes conserved cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds, while the D2 domain contains the WSXWS sequence motif (Walsh2012Structural).

The IL-7Rα forms a heterodimer with the common gamma chain (γc) to function, and its structure is characterized by a high percentage of apolar residues at the interface, resulting in a less specific and more apolar interaction compared to other cytokine receptors (Walsh2012Structural). Glycosylation significantly enhances the binding affinity of IL-7 to IL-7Rα, primarily due to an accelerated on-rate, although it does not directly participate in the binding interface (McElroy2009Structural). The IL-7Rα can exist as a monomer in solution, with no tendency to form higher-order oligomers (McElroy2012Structural).

## Function
The IL7R gene encodes the interleukin-7 receptor, which is crucial for the development and maintenance of T and B lymphocytes. The receptor is a heterodimer composed of the IL-7R alpha chain (IL-7Rα, also known as CD127) and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (γc, also known as CD132) (Chen2021Interleukin7; Mazzucchelli2007Interleukin-7). IL-7R signaling is initiated when interleukin-7 (IL-7) binds to this receptor complex, activating the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways, particularly STAT5 (Palmer2008Interleukin-7; Mazzucchelli2007Interleukin-7).

This signaling cascade promotes cell survival by regulating the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins, enhancing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and modulating pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax and Bad (Chen2021Interleukin7; Mazzucchelli2007Interleukin-7). IL-7R is also involved in the proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, playing a vital role in T-cell development and homeostasis (Chen2021Interleukin7; Palmer2008Interleukin-7). The receptor is primarily active on the cell surface of lymphoid lineage cells, including early thymocytes, T cells, and pre-B cells (Chen2021Interleukin7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL7R gene are associated with several diseases, primarily affecting the immune system. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a significant condition linked to IL7R mutations, particularly the T-B+NK+ phenotype, where T cells are absent, but B and NK cells are present. This form of SCID is caused by mutations that disrupt IL-7Rα expression, crucial for T cell development (Rai2024CRISPR/Cas9-Based; Campos2019Deleterious; Giliani2005Interleukin‐7).

IL7R polymorphisms are also implicated in autoimmune diseases. The SNP rs6897932 is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), where it affects IL-7Rα expression and splicing, potentially altering immune cell function (Lundmark2007Variation; Lundtoft2020IL7RA). This SNP is part of a haplotype that influences MS risk and is linked to other autoimmune conditions like type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis (Mazzucchelli2012The).

In cancer, IL7R overexpression is observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly in T-cell ALL, where it is associated with poor prognosis and JAK/STAT pathway mutations (Barata2019Flip; Gianfelici2018IL7R). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IL7R in both immunodeficiency and autoimmune disorders, as well as in oncogenesis.

## Interactions
The interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) is involved in several key interactions within the immune system. It forms a heterodimer with the common gamma chain (γc), which is essential for its function in signaling pathways that influence lymphocyte development. The IL-7/IL-7Rα complex interacts with γc to form a ternary complex that activates signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt, or SRC (Walsh2012Structural). The interaction between IL-7 and IL-7Rα is characterized by a relatively small, apolar, and less specific interface compared to other γc interleukins and their receptors, which may allow IL-7Rα to bind partners other than IL-7, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and its receptor (TSLPR) (Walsh2012Structural).

Glycosylation of IL-7Rα significantly enhances its binding affinity for IL-7, with glycosylated IL-7Rα showing a 300-fold increase in binding affinity compared to its unglycosylated form (Walsh2012Structural). This enhancement is primarily due to an increase in the association rate, suggesting that glycosylation stabilizes the receptor in a conformation more favorable for binding IL-7 (McElroy2009Structural).

IL7R also participates in interactions with nucleic acids, particularly in the regulation of exon 6 splicing. The splicing of IL7R exon 6 is influenced by the binding of U2AF2 to the exonic polypyrimidine tract, which can lead to exon skipping and increased levels of soluble IL7R, a factor associated with autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis (Schott2021U2AF2).
