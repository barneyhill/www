# UBE2NL

## Overview
UBE2NL is a gene that encodes a protein known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N-like, which is involved in the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway. This pathway is critical for regulating protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and cancer cell proliferation. The UBE2NL protein functions as an E2 ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, a process essential for their subsequent degradation. Structurally, UBE2NL shares significant similarity with other E2 enzymes, and its active site includes key residues that are crucial for binding interactions with substrates and other proteins, such as UBE2V2. The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including migraine without aura and gastroschisis, highlighting its potential significance in both neurological and developmental disorders (Salinas‐Torres2020Whole; Meghan2022Review; Jiang2015Six; Ramatenki2017Identification).

## Structure
The UBE2NL protein is modeled using homology modeling techniques, with its FASTA sequence retrieved from the UniProt server. The protein's molecular structure was developed using the MODELLER 9.12 software, selecting a template with PDB ID 1J7D_B due to its high sequence similarity of 92% to UBE2NL (Ramatenki2017Identification). The secondary structure of UBE2NL consists of four α-helices and four β-strands (Ramatenki2017Identification). The protein's 3D model was refined using the Schrödinger suite, which involved adding missing hydrogen atoms and optimizing hydrogen-bonded groups (Ramatenki2017Identification). 

The UBE2NL protein's active site includes residues such as PRO68, LYS69, VAL70, ARG71, ARG86, ILE87, and LYS93, which are crucial for binding interactions (Ramatenki2017Identification). The protein-protein docking studies with its natural substrate, UBE2V2, provide insights into molecular interactions and potential binding sites (Ramatenki2017Identification). The UBE2NL protein is involved in the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway, which is essential for cell cycle progression and cancer cell proliferation (Ramatenki2017Identification). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its potential role as an E2 ligase, given its similarity to other E2 enzymes (Meghan2022Review).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBE2NL gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine without aura (MWO). A nonsense mutation in UBE2NL leads to premature termination of transcription, resulting in a truncated protein that may disrupt the ubiquitination process. This disruption can prevent the normal degradation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A, increasing the number of these receptors in cells. Consequently, this enhances reactivity to 5-hydroxytryptamine, lowering the threshold for migraines and increasing their occurrence. This mutation was identified in patients with MWO but not in control subjects, suggesting a potential link between UBE2NL mutations and migraine susceptibility (Jiang2015Six).

In addition to its role in migraines, UBE2NL has been associated with gastroschisis, a birth defect involving the protrusion of intestines outside the body. Whole exome sequencing in a family with recurrent cases of gastroschisis identified UBE2NL as one of several genes with high-impact variations. These findings suggest that UBE2NL may play a role in the complex genetic interactions contributing to gastroschisis, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Salinas‐Torres2020Whole).

## Interactions
UBE2NL, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N-like protein, is involved in the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and cancer cell proliferation. It forms a heterodimer with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 (UBE2V2), interacting with the RING finger domain of E3 ubiquitin ligase to facilitate polyubiquitination and cell cycle progression (Ramatenki2017Identification). Protein-protein docking studies have identified key residues involved in the interaction between UBE2NL and UBE2V2, including GLU62, PRO68, LYS69, VAL70, and ARG86 (Ramatenki2017Identification).

The active site of UBE2NL, crucial for its interactions, includes residues such as PRO68, LYS69, VAL70, ARG71, ARG86, ILE87, and LYS93. These sites were identified using tools like CASTp, Q-site Finder, and SiteMap, which predict binding sites and surface pockets (Ramatenki2017Identification). The study of these interactions is significant for cancer therapy research, as inhibiting the UBE2NL-UBE2V2 heterodimer formation is proposed as a novel target for cancer drug discovery (Ramatenki2017Identification).
