# NEK9

## Overview
NEK9 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA-related kinase 9, a serine/threonine kinase involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during the cell cycle. The NEK9 protein is a member of the NIMA-related kinase family and plays a pivotal role in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. It functions as an upstream activator of other kinases, such as NEK6 and NEK7, and is essential for centrosome separation and proper mitotic progression. NEK9's activity is regulated through phosphorylation by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and CDK1, which are crucial for its role in cell division. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including skeletal dysplasia, nevus comedonicus, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Bertran2011Nek9; Casey2016Recessive; Xu2020Decreased).

## Structure
The NEK9 protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell cycle regulation and is part of the NIMA-related kinase family. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal kinase domain, a central RCC1-like domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (Casey2016Recessive; Tan2004Nek9). The kinase domain is crucial for its phosphorylation activity, while the RCC1-like domain is involved in chromatin organization and cell cycle regulation (Casey2016Recessive). The coiled-coil domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, which are essential for NEK9's function in mitotic spindle assembly (Richards2009An).

The secondary structure of NEK9 features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase, allowing NEK9 to interact with other proteins such as NEK6 and NEK7 (Haq2015Mechanistic). NEK9 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its role in activating NEK7 through binding and induced dimerization (Haq2015Mechanistic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate NEK9's activity. Specifically, phosphorylation at Thr 210 is noted to be crucial for its function (Tan2004Nek9). Splice variants of NEK9 may result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles within the cell (Müller2022NIMArelated).

## Function
NEK9 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. It is involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for chromosome segregation. NEK9 acts as an upstream activator of NEK6 and NEK7, phosphorylating them to facilitate proper spindle assembly. This kinase is crucial for centrosome separation, a key step in mitosis, by interacting with the kinesin Eg5 and the c-tubulin ring complex (c-TuRC), which is involved in microtubule nucleation (Bertran2011Nek9; Fry2012Cell).

NEK9 is activated by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and CDK1, which phosphorylate NEK9, enabling it to phosphorylate Eg5 at Ser1033, a modification necessary for centrosome separation and spindle formation. This process is essential for the recruitment of Eg5 to centrosomes during prophase, ensuring proper mitotic progression (Bertran2011Nek9).

In healthy human cells, NEK9 contributes to maintaining the fidelity of chromosome segregation by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are correctly aligned, thus preventing chromosomal instability and aneuploidy (Kaneta2013NEK9). NEK9 is active in the cytoplasm and centrosomes, influencing cell division and proliferation (Kaneta2013NEK9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NEK9 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. NEK9 mutations are associated with nevus comedonicus, a skin condition characterized by defective differentiation within the follicular unit. These mutations lead to abnormal localization of hair follicle differentiation markers, suggesting NEK9's role in epidermal function (Levinsohn2016Somatic). 

In skeletal disorders, recessive mutations in NEK9 cause lethal skeletal dysplasia, characterized by cell cycle and ciliary defects. Patients exhibit features such as shortened bones, rib anomalies, and thoracic dysplasia, indicating impaired ciliary function (Casey2016Recessive). NEK9 mutations are also linked to neonatal arthrogryposis, a condition with multiple joint contractures, expanding the clinical phenotype associated with NEK9 (Liu2023Novel).

In cancer, NEK9 expression is altered in various malignancies. In breast cancer, decreased NEK9 expression correlates with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancers (Xu2020Decreased). In gastric cancer, NEK9 is upregulated and promotes metastasis through the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, affecting cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization (Lu2021NEK9).

## Interactions
NEK9 is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. NEK9 forms a stable complex with the FACT complex, composed of hSpt16 and SSRP1, in interphase nuclei. This interaction is characterized by the phosphorylation of NEK9 at Thr 210, suggesting a role in maintaining proper G1 and S phase progression (Tan2004Nek9).

NEK9 is also involved in the recruitment of NEDD1 and γ-tubulin to the centrosome during mitosis, which is essential for efficient centrosomal microtubule assembly. NEK9 acts downstream of Plk1 and upstream of NEDD1, with NEDD1 being a substrate of NEK9. The phosphorylation of NEDD1 by NEK9 is crucial for its interaction with γ-tubulin (Sdelci2012Nek9).

NEK9 interacts with NEK6 and NEK7, facilitating their activation. It is activated by Plk1 and CDK1, which phosphorylate NEK9, enabling it to phosphorylate the mitotic kinesin Eg5. This phosphorylation is necessary for Eg5's recruitment to centrosomes and subsequent centrosome separation (Bertran2011Nek9). NEK9's interaction with NEK7 involves specific hydrophobic residues and is crucial for NEK7's activation (Haq2015Mechanistic).
