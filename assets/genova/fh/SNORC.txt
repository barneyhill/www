# SNORC

## Overview
The SNORC gene, also known as C2ORF82, encodes a type I transmembrane proteoglycan that plays a significant role in cartilage formation and chondrocyte maturation. The protein, referred to as the secondary ossification center associated regulator of chondrocyte maturation, is characterized by a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chain, which is essential for maintaining cartilage integrity by retaining water and resisting compression. SNORC is specifically expressed in chondrocytes and is involved in the regulation of bone development, particularly in secondary ossification centers. The protein's function is influenced by its interactions with growth factors such as FGF2, mediated by its ectodomain, and its expression is regulated by the transcription factor SOX9. Although knockout mouse models show mild phenotypic changes in the absence of SNORC, its precise role in cartilage development and maintenance underscores its biological importance (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

## Structure
The SNORC protein is composed of 121 amino acids, with a splice variant consisting of 120 amino acids. It features a cleavable signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, indicating its role as a type I transmembrane proteoglycan (Jaiswal2020Biochemical). The mature SNORC protein is predicted to be 97 residues long, with an extracellular N-terminus of 67 amino acids and an intracellular C-terminus of 6 amino acids, confirming its type I orientation at the cell surface (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

SNORC is characterized by a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chain attached to serine 44 on its extracellular domain. This GAG chain is primarily composed of chondroitin sulfate, although it is not entirely homogeneous (Jaiswal2020Biochemical). The protein's anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE, appearing as a smear between 35 and 60 kDa, is attributed to its core protein structure and intrinsic disorder, a feature common to syndecans (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

In silico analysis has identified potential O-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, suggesting post-translational modifications that may influence its function (Jaiswal2020Biochemical). The SNORC protein shares similarities with other type I proteins involved in chondrocyte activity, such as syndecans and versicans, which mediate growth factor binding and presentation (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

## Function
The SNORC gene, also known as C2ORF82, is specifically expressed in chondrocytes, the cells responsible for cartilage formation. It encodes a type I transmembrane proteoglycan that carries a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chain, which is crucial for its function in cartilage. This GAG chain helps maintain the structural integrity of cartilage by retaining water and resisting compression, which is essential for cartilage's role in cushioning joints and supporting skeletal structure (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

SNORC is involved in the regulation of chondrocyte maturation, a critical process in bone development, particularly in secondary ossification centers. It is suggested that SNORC may interact with growth factors such as FGF2, although this interaction is mediated by the protein's ectodomain rather than the GAG chain (Jaiswal2020Biochemical). The expression of SNORC is regulated by the transcription factor SOX9, with a conserved SOX9-binding enhancer located in intron 1 being crucial for its transcription (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

In knockout mouse models, the absence of SNORC results in mild phenotypic changes, such as an enlarged growth plate and altered chondrocyte shape, but does not significantly affect bone length or mineralization, indicating its role in cartilage development and maintenance (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

## Interactions
The SNORC protein, associated with chondrocyte maturation, has been studied for its potential interactions with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Although the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chain of SNORC is not the preferred binding site for FGFs, recombinant SNORC has been shown to bind FGF2 in vitro. This interaction is mediated by the protein's ectodomain rather than the GAG chain, suggesting that SNORC's function may involve direct or indirect intracellular signaling pathways (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

The transcriptional regulation of SNORC involves interactions with the transcription factor SOX9. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have demonstrated that SOX9 binds to specific sites within the intronic region of the Snorc gene, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This binding is crucial for the regulation of SNORC expression in chondrocytes (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).

Despite these findings, the specific physical interactions of SNORC with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored. The in vivo function of SNORC in FGF signaling and its potential role in multiprotein complexes or other transitory interactions require further investigation (Jaiswal2020Biochemical).
