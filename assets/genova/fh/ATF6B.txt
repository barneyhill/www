# ATF6B

## Overview
ATF6B, or activating transcription factor 6 beta, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical mechanism for managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The protein product, activating transcription factor 6 beta, is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in maintaining ER function and calcium homeostasis, particularly in neuronal cells. Unlike its paralogue ATF6A, ATF6B does not promote the expression of cell death-related molecules, making it more effective in protecting neurons from stress-induced apoptosis. It is primarily expressed in the hippocampus and is integral to the ATF6B-calreticulin axis, which is essential for neuronal survival under ER stress conditions (Nguyen2021The). ATF6B's interactions with other proteins, including bZIP family members, underscore its involvement in complex regulatory networks that modulate gene expression in response to cellular stress (Kohl2015Mutations; Kaplan2014Increasing).

## Function
ATF6B (activating transcription factor 6 beta) is a transcription factor involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism activated in response to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to misfolded proteins. In healthy human cells, ATF6B plays a crucial role in maintaining ER function and calcium homeostasis, which are vital for proper cellular function and survival. It specifically regulates the expression of calreticulin (CRT), a molecular chaperone with high calcium-binding capacity, which is essential for maintaining intracellular calcium balance and promoting neuronal survival under ER stress conditions (Nguyen2021The).

ATF6B is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is involved in the expression of molecular chaperones in the ER, with a specific focus on the ATF6B-calreticulin axis. This axis is crucial for neuronal survival under conditions of ER stress and excitotoxicity by maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis (Nguyen2021The). Unlike its paralogue ATF6α, ATF6B does not enhance the expression of cell death-related molecules, making it more effective in rescuing neurons from stress-induced death (Nguyen2021The). ATF6B's activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, where it regulates genes involved in protein folding, secretion, and degradation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATF6B gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiac health, ATF6B plays a role in the unfolded protein response during cardiac stress. Mice lacking ATF6B exhibit reduced cardiac hypertrophy under short-term pressure overload but experience enhanced heart failure with long-term pressure overload, indicating its importance in managing cardiac stress and preventing heart failure (Correll2019Overlapping).

In the central nervous system, ATF6B is crucial for neuronal survival under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The ATF6B-calreticulin (CRT) axis is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis and promoting neuronal survival. Deficiency in ATF6B leads to reduced CRT expression, altered calcium levels, and increased neuronal death under ER stress conditions. This suggests a potential link between ATF6B dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases, where ER stress is a contributing factor (Nguyen2021The).

Despite its involvement in stress responses, polymorphisms in the ATF6B gene have not been significantly associated with schizophrenia susceptibility, as shown in a study focusing on the Iranian population (Moudi2020Polymorphism). This indicates that while ATF6B is involved in stress response pathways, its genetic variations may not directly contribute to schizophrenia.

## Interactions
ATF6B, a transcription factor involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It shares significant sequence homology with ATF6A, and both proteins possess conserved bZIP and DNA-binding domains, allowing them to bind to ER stress-response elements (ERSEs) as homo- or heterodimers (Kohl2015Mutations). Although ATF6B was previously considered a weak transcription factor, it plays a role similar to ATF6A in upregulating genes involved in ER function and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) activity (Correll2019Overlapping).

ATF6B does not require Thbs4 for its initial trafficking step, unlike ATF6A, suggesting it may engage with unique regulatory partners distinct from those of ATF6A (Correll2019Overlapping). It is also involved in interactions with other bZIP proteins, such as CREBZF, which form stronger homodimers or bind more tightly to other bZIPs (Kaplan2014Increasing). The study of peptides designed to bind specifically to bZIP domains, including those of ATF6B, highlights the potential for ATF6B to participate in complex interaction networks with other bZIP proteins (Kaplan2014Increasing). These interactions are crucial for its role in cellular stress responses and gene regulation.
