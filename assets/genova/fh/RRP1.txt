# RRP1

## Overview
RRP1, or ribosomal RNA processing 1, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein crucial for ribosome biogenesis in human cells. The protein, also referred to as Nop52, is involved in the early stages of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, particularly in the cleavage of pre-rRNA within the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). This process is essential for the maturation of pre-rRNA into functional rRNA intermediates, which are necessary for the assembly of ribosomal subunits. RRP1 is localized in the nucleolus and interacts with various nucleolar proteins, playing a collaborative role in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. Its function is vital for maintaining proper ribosome biogenesis, and dysregulation of RRP1 is associated with several diseases, including cancer, where it contributes to hyperactive ribosome biogenesis (Zang2024Genomic; Yoshikawa2015Human).

## Function
The RRP1 gene encodes a nucleolar protein involved in the early stages of ribosome biogenesis in human cells. RRP1 plays a critical role in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), specifically in the site 2 cleavage within the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of pre-rRNAs. This cleavage is essential for the maturation of 47S pre-rRNA into smaller rRNA intermediates, such as 36S and 30SL5 pre-rRNAs, which are necessary for the formation of functional ribosomal subunits (Yoshikawa2015Human).

RRP1 is localized in the nucleolus, where it associates with pre-60S and 90S ribosomal particles, indicating its involvement in both early and late stages of ribosome assembly. Its presence in the nucleolus is dependent on active RNA polymerase I transcription (Yoshikawa2015Human). The protein interacts with other nucleolar proteins, such as C1QBP, BOP1, and RBM28, suggesting a collaborative role in pre-rRNA processing (Yoshikawa2015Human).

RRP1's function is crucial for the proper cleavage and processing of pre-rRNA, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of certain pre-rRNA intermediates and a reduction in mature rRNA species, highlighting its essential role in ribosome biogenesis (Yoshikawa2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
RRP1 (ribosomal RNA processing 1) plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer, hyperactive ribosome biogenesis, involving genes like RRP1, is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. This hyperactivity is associated with poor clinical outcomes in several cancer types, including lung squamous cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Zang2024Genomic). The study highlights that 251 out of 331 RiboSis-related genes, including RRP1, are essential for tumor growth and survival, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets (Zang2024Genomic).

While the specific role of RRP1 in neurodegenerative diseases is not detailed, ribosome dysfunction is noted to contribute to conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These diseases are characterized by disruptions in neuronal homeostasis due to impaired ribosome biogenesis, which may involve genes like RRP1 (Jiao2023Ribosome). The involvement of ribosome biogenesis in these diseases suggests that alterations in RRP1 expression or function could have significant clinical implications, although direct evidence linking RRP1 to these conditions is not explicitly provided in the context.

## Interactions
The human RRP1 protein, also known as Nop52, is involved in ribosome biogenesis and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids. RRP1 is crucial for the cleavage of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of pre-rRNAs at early stages, specifically at site 2, which is essential for the production of 30SL5 and 32S pre-rRNAs (Yoshikawa2015Human). It interacts with proteins such as BOP1, RBM28, and potentially NOL12, forming a complex that regulates this specific cleavage step (Yoshikawa2015Human).

RRP1 is suggested to replace fibrillarin in binding to p32 (C1QBP), a key event in the splitting of the large 90S preribosomal particle into pre-40S and pre-60S subunits. This interaction is crucial for the physical separation of these particles, highlighting RRP1's role in the early stages of ribosome assembly (Yoshikawa2015Human). The presence of RRP1 in the 90S particle and its localization in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus depend on active RNA polymerase I transcription, indicating its involvement in the nucleolar processes essential for ribosome biogenesis (Yoshikawa2015Human).
