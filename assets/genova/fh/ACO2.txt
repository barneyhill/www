# ACO2

## Overview
The ACO2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme aconitase 2, a key component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. This enzyme is classified as an iron-sulfur protein due to its essential 4Fe-4S cluster, which is critical for its catalytic activity in converting citrate to isocitrate. Aconitase 2 plays a vital role in cellular energy production and iron homeostasis, and it also functions as a mitochondrial redox-sensor, protecting mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Mutations in the ACO2 gene are linked to various neurodegenerative disorders, including optic atrophy and spastic paraplegia, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Mirel1998Characterization; Kim2014Mitochondriatargeted; Charif2021DominantACO2mutations).

## Structure
The human ACO2 gene encodes the mitochondrial aconitase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the citric acid cycle by catalyzing the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate. The primary structure of ACO2 consists of a polypeptide chain composed of 780 amino acids (Mirel1998Characterization). The protein's secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of ACO2 is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. ACO2 functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits associate to form the active enzyme (Mirel1998Characterization).

A key feature of ACO2 is the presence of a 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster within its active site, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Mirel1998Characterization). This cluster plays a critical role in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and is involved in iron homeostasis. The protein also contains a mitochondrial import sequence at its N-terminus, facilitating its transport into the mitochondria (Mirel1998Characterization). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, may influence the function and stability of ACO2, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The ACO2 gene encodes mitochondrial aconitase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate, a key step in cellular energy production. The activity of mitochondrial aconitase is iron-dependent, requiring a 4Fe-4S cluster for its catalytic function (Mirel1998Characterization). 

ACO2 is active within the mitochondria, where it contributes to the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including adipogenesis, where ACO2-mediated ATP production is a rate-limiting factor (Chen2020Mitochondrial). The enzyme also plays a role in maintaining iron homeostasis within cells, as its activity is sensitive to cellular iron levels (Mirel1998Characterization).

In addition to its metabolic functions, ACO2 is involved in protecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from oxidative damage. It acts as a mitochondrial redox-sensor and helps preserve mtDNA integrity, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis (Kim2014Mitochondriatargeted). This protective role is crucial for maintaining cellular health under oxidative stress conditions (Kim2014Mitochondriatargeted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACO2 gene, which encodes mitochondrial aconitase, are associated with a range of neurodegenerative disorders. These include isolated optic atrophy, infantile cerebellar retinal degeneration, and spastic paraplegia. Both dominant and recessive mutations in ACO2 can lead to optic atrophy, with dominant mutations often resulting in milder symptoms compared to recessive ones (Charif2021DominantACO2mutations). The gene's mutations are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting the tricarboxylic acid cycle and leading to optic nerve degeneration (Charif2021DominantACO2mutations).

In some cases, ACO2 mutations result in severe neurodegenerative symptoms, such as hypotonia, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, often leading to early legal blindness (Sharkia2019Clinical). ACO2 variants have also been implicated in complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, characterized by episodic visual loss and progressive lower limb spasticity (Tozawa2021Complex). Additionally, ACO2 deficiency has been linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion and impaired energy metabolism, contributing to the severity of these conditions (Sadat2016Functional).

The clinical manifestations of ACO2-related disorders are diverse, with some patients experiencing mild symptoms and others facing severe, life-threatening conditions (Blackburn2020Expanding). The variability in clinical outcomes is partly due to differences in residual aconitase activity and the specific mutations present (Park2020Novel).

## Interactions
ACO2 (aconitase 2) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function. In prostate cancer cells, ACO2 interacts with the mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). SIRT3 regulates the acetylation of ACO2 at lysine 258, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The acetylation status of ACO2 is modulated by SIRT3, which can deacetylate ACO2, thereby affecting its function in mitochondrial citrate synthesis and lipogenesis (Sawant2020Transcriptional).

ACO2 also participates in the regulation of autophagy and mitophagy through its interaction with the ROS/FoxO1 signaling pathway. Overexpression of ACO2 in cancer cells leads to increased mitophagy, characterized by the recruitment of PARKIN and elevated levels of ubiquitinated proteins in mitochondrial fractions. This process involves the transcriptional upregulation of autophagic genes such as LC3B and ATG4B, which are targets of FoxO proteins, particularly FoxO1. The nuclear localization of FoxO1 and its recruitment to autophagic gene promoters are disrupted upon ROS scavenging, indicating a regulatory interaction between ACO2 and FoxO1 (Ciccarone2019Aconitase).

These interactions highlight ACO2's role in metabolic reprogramming and stress response pathways, which are critical in cancer cell proliferation and survival.
