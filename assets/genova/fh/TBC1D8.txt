# TBC1D8

## Overview
TBC1D8 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 8, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). The protein is categorized as a member of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family, which is known for its role in regulating intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. TBC1D8 is implicated in the regulation of peptidase activity, cell-cell adhesion, and the maintenance of the gastrointestinal epithelium, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and cancer pathogenesis (Liu2022An). The gene's expression is notably upregulated in CRC tissues, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Furthermore, TBC1D8 is involved in the immune microenvironment of tumors, influencing immune cell infiltration and macrophage polarization, which are critical for tumor progression and metastasis (Liu2022An). These characteristics make TBC1D8 a potential target for therapeutic interventions and a marker for disease prognosis in CRC (Liu2022An).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TBC1D8 gene has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its role in metabolic reprogramming and its potential as an independent prognostic factor. Altered expression of TBC1D8 is associated with processes crucial for tumor growth and metastasis, such as angiogenesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix. The gene's expression is higher in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its cytoplasmic or membrane-associated expression is linked to shorter overall survival and progression-free intervals in CRC patients (Liu2022An).

TBC1D8 is also involved in the immune microenvironment of CRC, with its expression correlating with immune cell infiltration, including macrophages and T cells. This suggests that TBC1D8 may influence macrophage polarization, particularly M2 macrophage infiltration, which is associated with tumor progression (Liu2022An). Additionally, TBC1D8 expression is linked to hypoxic conditions in tumors, contributing to tumor proliferation and stemness, which are critical for cancer progression (Liu2022An).

Overall, the dysregulation of TBC1D8 expression and its interactions in CRC highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions and as a marker for disease prognosis (Liu2022An).

## Interactions
TBC1D8 is involved in various interactions that influence its role in colorectal cancer (CRC). It is part of a network of genes interacting with TBC1D8, as identified using GeneMANIA, which highlights its involvement in biological processes such as regulation of peptidase activity, cell-cell adhesion, and maintenance of the gastrointestinal epithelium (Liu2022An). TBC1D8 interacts with neighboring genes through physical interactions, co-expression, co-localization, predicted common pathways, genetic interactions, and common protein domains (Liu2022An). 

The study by Liu et al. also notes that TBC1D8 expression is associated with increased infiltration of various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and B cells, suggesting interactions with the immune microenvironment (Liu2022An). TBC1D8 is linked to the hypoxic phenotype in CRC, and its expression is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, which may influence tumor stemness and growth (Liu2022An). Although specific protein-protein interactions of TBC1D8 are not detailed, its involvement in these processes suggests a complex network of interactions that contribute to its role in CRC pathogenesis.
