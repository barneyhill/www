# SCAP

## Overview
SCAP (SREBF chaperone) is a gene that encodes the SREBP cleavage-activating protein, a polytopic membrane protein integral to cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. The SCAP protein functions as a chaperone, facilitating the transport of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, where they undergo proteolytic activation. This process is essential for the regulation of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. SCAP contains a sterol-sensing domain that allows it to respond to intracellular cholesterol levels, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid balance. The protein's interactions with insulin-induced gene (INSIG) proteins and its regulation through post-translational modifications underscore its importance in metabolic pathways and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and liver disorders (Sun2005Insig; Chandrasekaran2024The; Lee2020The).

## Structure
SCAP (SREBF chaperone) is a polytopic membrane protein composed of 1276 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 140 kDa. It is divided into two main functional regions: the N-terminal transmembrane region and the soluble C-terminal domain. The N-terminal region contains eight transmembrane helices, organized into α-helices separated by hydrophilic loops, with two large loops in the ER lumen and one facing the cytosol (Chandrasekaran2024The; Lee2020The). This region includes a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) crucial for cholesterol interaction, located within transmembrane segments 2-6 (Yang2002Crucial).

The C-terminal domain contains four WD40 repeats, which facilitate binding to SREBPs, forming a stable SCAP/SREBP complex (Chandrasekaran2024The). SCAP's interaction with COPII proteins is mediated by a hexapeptide sequence (MELADL) located in loop 6, which is essential for the transport of SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Sun2005Insig; Lee2020The).

SCAP undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can influence its activity and stability (Nohturfft2000Regulated). The protein can form a homotetramer with its membrane region, contributing to its functional stability (Lee2020The).

## Function
SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) is integral to cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism in human cells. It functions as a chaperone for sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), facilitating their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This transport is crucial for the activation of SREBPs, which are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (Sun2005Insig; Lee2020The).

SCAP is a sterol-sensing protein that responds to intracellular cholesterol levels. Under low sterol conditions, SCAP undergoes a conformational change that allows the SCAP/SREBP complex to be packaged into COPII-coated vesicles for transport to the Golgi. In the Golgi, SREBPs are cleaved by site-1 and site-2 proteases, releasing their active forms that translocate to the nucleus to activate lipid biosynthesis genes (Shimano2017SREBP-regulated; Chandrasekaran2024The).

When cholesterol levels are high, SCAP binds to insulin-induced gene (INSIG) proteins, retaining the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER and preventing SREBP activation. This feedback mechanism helps maintain cholesterol balance within the cell (Sun2005Insig; Lee2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SCAP gene have significant clinical implications. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SCAP is crucial for tumor growth as it facilitates the activation of SREBP-1, a transcription factor involved in lipid biosynthesis. Enhanced SCAP expression and glycosylation lead to increased SREBP-1 activation, promoting aggressive tumorigenesis. Knockdown of SCAP in GBM models reduces tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2015Glucose-Mediated).

In the context of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), SCAP plays a protective role in liver health. Its deletion exacerbates liver injury, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis, suggesting that SCAP is essential for maintaining liver integrity. The SCAP/SREBP pathway is involved in regulating lipid metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to significant liver pathology (Kawamura2022Inhibiting).

In the brain, SCAP is vital for cholesterol metabolism and neuronal function. Homozygous deletion of SCAP in mice results in perinatal lethality, microcephaly, and gliosis, highlighting its importance in brain development. Reduced SCAP expression in diabetic mice is associated with impaired synaptic transmission and cognitive dysfunction, potentially contributing to neurological complications (Suzuki2013Reduction).

## Interactions
SCAP (SREBF chaperone) is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cholesterol homeostasis. SCAP interacts with SREBPs (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins) to facilitate their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This transport is essential for the activation of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (Weber2004Maintaining; Kober2021Scap).

SCAP also interacts with Insig proteins, which are integral to its function in cholesterol sensing. When cholesterol levels are high, cholesterol binds to SCAP, causing a conformational change that promotes its interaction with Insig proteins. This interaction retains the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER, preventing SREBP activation and thus reducing cholesterol synthesis (Kober2021Scap).

Mutations in SCAP can affect its interaction with Insig, as demonstrated by the cScap D435V mutation, which allows SCAP to bind Insig even in the absence of sterols, blocking SREBP2 cleavage (Kober2021Scap). Additionally, glucose-mediated N-glycosylation of SCAP reduces its binding to Insig-1, facilitating SCAP/SREBP trafficking to the Golgi (Cheng2015Glucose-Mediated).
