# HNF1B

## Overview
HNF1B, or Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Beta, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor crucial for the regulation of gene expression in various tissues, particularly during embryonic development. The protein product, HNF1 homeobox B, is characterized by its role as a transcription factor, featuring a bipartite POU domain and functioning primarily in the nucleus to modulate the transcription of target genes. It is involved in the development and differentiation of several organs, including the liver, kidney, and pancreas, and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism. HNF1B is known for its ability to form homodimers or heterodimers with HNF1A, influencing its functional activity. Mutations in the HNF1B gene are associated with various clinical conditions, including renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD), highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Hojny2020Identification; Chandra2021Hepatocyte; Lim2020Genotype).

## Structure
HNF1B, also known as Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Beta, is a transcription factor with a complex molecular structure. It is characterized by a bipartite POU domain, which includes two subunits separated by a short non-conserved region, and is anticipated to be alpha-helical, potentially forming a coiled structure (Chandra2021Hepatocyte). The protein contains three main functional domains: a dimerization domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a transactivation domain (Çubuk2021A). The DNA-binding domain includes POU-like and homeodomain motifs, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Çubuk2021A).

HNF1B can form homodimers or heterodimers with HNF1A, influencing its quaternary structure and functional activity (Lau2018The). The gene encodes multiple transcript variants through alternative splicing, including classical variants A, B, and D, and annotated variants C, C', and E, each with distinct roles in different tissues (Chandra2024Delineating; Chandra2021Hepatocyte). Variant C, for instance, lacks the transactivation domain, affecting its function (Chandra2021Hepatocyte). The protein's structure and function are further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The HNF1B gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of various tissues and organs during embryogenesis, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, reproductive tract, and biliary system (Hojny2020Identification; Gambella2023The). In healthy human cells, HNF1B functions as a transcription activator, regulating genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism (Hojny2020Identification). It is primarily expressed in tubule-forming epithelial tissues, such as those in the kidney and pancreatic exocrine duct tubules, as well as in the gall bladder, colon, duodenum, intestine, lung, stomach, urinary bladder, liver, endometrium, prostate, testis, and appendix (Hojny2020Identification).

HNF1B is involved in the regulation of genes associated with stem or progenitor cells and is essential for the development of specialized epithelia in several organs (Gambella2023The). It acts in concert with other developmental genes to influence organ morphogenesis and is part of an autoregulatory network with HNF1A and HNF4A, which are involved in various cellular processes (Harries2009SpeciesSpecific). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the transcription of target genes, influencing cellular processes like differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism (Hojny2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNF1B gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting the kidneys, pancreas, and liver. One of the most notable conditions linked to HNF1B mutations is renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD), also known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5). This syndrome is characterized by the presence of renal cysts and early-onset diabetes, with renal abnormalities being the most consistent feature (Sztromwasser2020A; DuboisLaforgue2017Diabetes). Renal manifestations can include cystic dysplasia, hypoplasia, and other congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (Nagano2019Clinical; Lim2020Genotype).

Patients with HNF1B mutations often experience progressive renal functional deterioration, with some progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Lim2020Genotype). Extrarenal manifestations include pancreatic abnormalities, such as hypoplasia or cysts, and liver function abnormalities (DuboisLaforgue2017Diabetes; Lim2020Genotype). Neurological deficits, including mental retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have also been reported in some cases (Lim2020Genotype).

The inheritance pattern of HNF1B-related disorders is generally autosomal dominant, but de novo mutations and whole-gene deletions are also common (Nagano2019Clinical). The phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance of HNF1B mutations make diagnosis challenging (Lim2020Genotype).

## Interactions
HNF1B is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression in different tissues. It binds to specific regions of nucleic acids and is involved in the regulation of several kidney- and liver-specific genes. HNF1B interacts with proteins such as PTF1A, PCBD1, PCBD2, PKHD1 (Fibrocystin), UMOD (Uromodulin), HNF4A, ONECUT1 (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 6), and SLC2A2. These interactions are significant for processes like pancreatic development, kidney cell function, and glucose uptake (Sneha2018Probing).

In the context of ovarian cancer, HNF1B has been shown to have direct interactions with proteins and genes involved in drug resistance, including ONECUT1, NFKB1, PTEN, EGFR, PDCD4, and MLH1. It also physically interacts with HNF1A and ATF1, which are associated with drug resistance mechanisms (LI2014Downregulation).

HNF1B is also involved in the regulation of pancreatic beta cells, affecting insulin regulation and glucose uptake by interacting with proteins such as GCK, G6PC, and PDX1. These interactions are part of a common pathway for insulin and glucose regulation, highlighting the interconnectedness of these proteins in metabolic processes (Sneha2018Probing).
