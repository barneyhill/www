# MAPK7

## Overview
MAPK7 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 7, also known as ERK5, which is a member of the MAP kinase family. This protein kinase plays a pivotal role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, influencing various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. ERK5 is characterized by its unique structural features, including an N-terminal kinase domain and a large C-terminal domain with transcriptional transactivating capabilities (Chen2016Discovery). It is activated by extracellular signals and translocates to the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression, particularly in endothelial cells, contributing to cardiovascular development and homeostasis (Li2021Pitavastatin). The MAPK7 gene has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Green2020Targeting; Gavine2015Identification).

## Structure
The MAPK7 protein, also known as ERK5, is a member of the MAP kinase family and exhibits a distinct structural composition. It consists of an N-terminal kinase domain and a large C-terminal domain with transcriptional transactivating functionality, as well as nuclear localization and export sequences (NLS/NES) (Chen2016Discovery). The kinase domain of ERK5 features a characteristic two-lobe structure, with a hinge region linking the lobes, a glycine-rich P-loop enclosing the ATP-binding site, and an activation loop bounded by conserved DFG and APE motifs (Chen2016Discovery). The C-terminus extends beyond the canonical kinase domain, forming an extended loop followed by an alpha-helix that stabilizes the C helix in an active-like conformation (Chen2016Discovery).

ERK5 is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation, and is activated by growth factors and cellular stresses (Chen2016Discovery). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The structural analysis of ERK5 has also identified a novel allosteric inhibitor-binding site, which offers potential therapeutic interventions in oncology (Chen2016Discovery). The context does not provide information on the primary or quaternary structure, nor does it mention splice variant isoforms.

## Function
MAPK7, also known as ERK5, is a protein kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in maintaining endothelial cell integrity and homeostasis. In healthy human cells, MAPK7 is activated by extracellular signals and translocates to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression. This kinase is essential for cardiovascular development and the maintenance of endothelial cell function, contributing to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Li2021Pitavastatin).

MAPK7 is particularly important in protecting endothelial cells from inflammation and injury, which are key factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension. It helps maintain cell viability and reduces inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in endothelial cells. The activation of MAPK7 enhances nitric oxide (NO) production and the expression of endothelial NO synthase, which are critical for vascular function and blood pressure regulation (Li2021Pitavastatin).

In the context of vascular endothelial cells, MAPK7 mediates anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and vasodilatory effects, which are vital for preserving endothelial function and mitigating vascular damage. These functions underscore the importance of MAPK7 in maintaining cardiovascular health and preventing disease (Li2021Pitavastatin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPK7 gene, also known as ERK5, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), de novo mutations in MAPK7 are associated with disruptions in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for neural-synaptic formation and brain development. These mutations may contribute to ASD onset by affecting normal cellular development and maturation (Jiao2019Identification).

In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), rare coding variants in MAPK7 have been identified as predisposing factors. These variants disrupt nuclear translocation, a critical function of MAPK7, and are more frequent in AIS patients compared to controls, suggesting a significant association with the condition (Gao2017Rare).

MAPK7 is also involved in cancer progression. Overexpression of MAPK7 is linked to poor prognosis in osteosarcoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor treatment response (TesserGamba2020MAPK7; TesserGamba2012MAPK7). In primary bone cancer, the MAPK7/MMP9 signaling axis is a driver of metastasis, and targeting MAPK7 could potentially inhibit metastasis by affecting MMP9 expression (Green2020Targeting). Additionally, MAPK7 dysregulation has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer, where it is considered a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Gavine2015Identification).

## Interactions
MAPK7, also known as ERK5, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is directly targeted by microRNAs such as miR-27a and miR-143, which regulate its expression. In skin cancer cells, miR-27a binds to MAPK7, suppressing its expression and affecting cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion (Cao2020MicroRNA27a). In osteosarcoma, miR-143 targets MAPK7, reducing cell proliferation and migration (Dong2017MiR143).

MAPK7 is also part of the MAPK signaling pathway, interacting with proteins like MEK5, which phosphorylates and activates it. This interaction is crucial for its role in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Gavine2015Identification). In the context of cancer, MAPK7 interacts with transcription factors like MEF2A and MEF2D, which are modulated upon MAPK7 inhibition, indicating its role in tumor cell proliferation (Gavine2015Identification).

In primary bone cancer, MAPK7 regulates MMP9 expression, influencing metastasis and tumor invasiveness. This interaction is significant for maintaining a pro-tumor immune environment and facilitating metastasis (Green2020Targeting). These interactions highlight MAPK7's role in various cellular and pathological processes.
