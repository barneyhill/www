# ZNF282

## Overview
ZNF282 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 282, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZNF) family, which is characterized by its role as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly during brain development, and is known for its ability to bind to a wide array of gene promoters, including those not associated with transposable elements, thereby influencing various cellular processes (Farmiloe2020Widespread). Structurally, zinc finger protein 282 contains five C2H2 zinc fingers and a KRAB domain, which typically functions as a transcriptional repressor, although the KRAB domain in this protein lacks the canonical MLE motif necessary for interaction with TRIM28, suggesting unique regulatory behaviors (al2020transcription; Wu2014Distinct). The protein also plays a role in coactivating the estrogen receptor and interacts with other coregulators, highlighting its importance in gene-specific regulation and cellular functions such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. ZNF282's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in both normal cellular biology and disease contexts, including cancer.

## Function
ZNF282 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, particularly during brain development. It is part of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZNF) family, which is known for binding to gene promoters and influencing gene expression patterns. ZNF282, like other KZNFs, binds to a large number of gene promoters, including those not associated with transposable elements, indicating a broad regulatory role in cellular processes (Farmiloe2020Widespread).

Structurally, ZNF282 contains five C2H2 zinc fingers that facilitate DNA binding, along with a KRAB domain that typically acts as a transcriptional repressor. However, the KRAB domain in ZNF282 lacks the canonical MLE motif necessary for interaction with TRIM28, suggesting it may have unique transcriptional regulation behaviors compared to other KRAB domains (al2020transcription; Wu2014Distinct).

ZNF282 is also involved in coactivating the estrogen receptor and functions synergistically with other coregulators, such as CoCoA, in gene-specific regulation (Wu2014Distinct). Its activity is primarily nuclear, where it modulates the expression of genes critical for maintaining normal cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF282 (zinc finger protein 282) is implicated in various diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression or mutations. In cancer, ZNF282 has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Changes in its expression levels can influence the behavior of cancer cells, potentially affecting their growth and spread. The exact mechanisms by which ZNF282 contributes to cancer progression are still under investigation, but its role as a transcription factor suggests it may regulate genes critical to cell proliferation and survival.

Beyond cancer, the clinical significance of ZNF282 is still being explored. While specific diseases linked to mutations in ZNF282 have not been fully elucidated, its involvement in gene regulation indicates that alterations could impact a range of biological processes. This potential makes ZNF282 a subject of interest for further research into its role in other conditions. Understanding the pathways and interactions influenced by ZNF282 could provide insights into its broader clinical implications and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ZNF282 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily mediated by its DUF3669 domain. This domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments where HA-tagged ZNF282 was captured with a full-length GFP-tagged ZNF398, but not with a DUF3669-deleted version, indicating the importance of DUF3669 in these associations (Helleboid2019The). ZNF282 can form homo- and heterodimers through the DUF3669 domain, allowing it to bind to promoters in a combinatorial manner, which suggests a role in transcription regulation through interactions with other proteins (Maksimenko2021CTCF).

The DUF3669 domain also contributes to transcriptional repression and oligomerization, even in the absence of strong TRIM28 binding. Sumoylation, a posttranslational modification, may regulate ZNF282, affecting its stability, interactions, and localization. A sumoylation-defective mutant of ZFP282, the mouse ortholog of ZNF282, showed reduced transactivation capacity, suggesting that sumoylation is significant for its interaction with other proteins, such as the estrogen receptor alpha (Al2019DUF3669).

ZNF282 is part of a network of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) that interact with KAP1 and other cofactors, although some KZFPs, including those with DUF3669, do not bind KAP1, indicating a diverse interaction profile (Helleboid2019The).
