# BMP10

## Overview
BMP10 is a gene that encodes the protein bone morphogenetic protein 10, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cardiovascular development and function, playing a crucial role in heart development and vascular homeostasis. As a signaling molecule, BMP10 interacts with specific receptors such as activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII), facilitating pathways that regulate angiogenesis and endothelial cell behavior. The protein's structure, characterized by its ability to form homodimers and interact with receptors through specific domains, is essential for its biological activity. BMP10's involvement in critical signaling pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cardiovascular stability and its potential implications in various cardiovascular diseases (Guo2022Crystal; Tillet2018A; Desroches‐Castan2021BMP9).

## Structure
BMP10, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, is involved in cardiovascular development and exhibits a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of BMP10 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a precursor protein, which is cleaved to produce the mature protein. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its functional conformation (Guo2022Crystal).

The tertiary structure of BMP10 involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds. This structure is crucial for its interaction with receptors such as ALK1 and BMPRII. The BMP10 protein can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which is essential for its biological activity (Guo2022Crystal).

BMP10 interacts with receptors through specific domains, including the growth factor (GF) domain, which binds to the ALK1 extracellular domain. The crystal structure of the BMP10:ALK1 complex reveals specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, that define receptor specificity (Salmon2020Molecular). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, may also occur, influencing BMP10's stability and function (Guo2022Crystal). These structural features are critical for BMP10's role in signaling pathways related to cardiovascular development and disease.

## Function
BMP10 is a critical component in cardiovascular development and function, primarily expressed in the heart. It plays a significant role in heart development, particularly in the trabeculation of the myocardium, and is essential for maintaining heart homeostasis. BMP10 is involved in the proliferation of cardiomyocytes, which are crucial for heart growth and repair (Li2016Regulation; Desroches‐Castan2021BMP9).

In the vascular system, BMP10 functions as a high-affinity ligand for the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), a receptor expressed on endothelial cells. This interaction is vital for maintaining vascular homeostasis and regulating angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. BMP10, along with BMP9, initiates signaling pathways that lead to the phosphorylation of SMAD transcription factors, influencing the expression of target genes involved in vascular stability and endothelial cell behavior (Tillet2018A; Desroches‐Castan2021BMP9).

BMP10 is also involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for endothelial cell function and vascular remodeling. This regulation suggests a cooperative role with BMP9 in maintaining vascular quiescence and stability (Ricard2012BMP9). BMP10's activity is primarily localized in the extracellular space, where it binds to its receptors to initiate these signaling pathways (Li2016Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BMP10 gene are associated with several cardiovascular conditions, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), congenital heart defects (CHD), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In a study of a Chinese Han family, a novel BMP10 mutation, NM_014482.3: c.166C > T;p.(Gln56*), was identified as a cause of DCM. This mutation results in a loss of function, impairing the activation of DCM-causative genes NKX2.5 and TBX20, suggesting BMP10 haploinsufficiency as a pathogenic mechanism (Gu2023Identification).

Another mutation, NM_014482.3:c.247G>T;p.(Glu83*), has been linked to CHD, specifically patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This mutation leads to a truncated BMP10 protein, affecting the activation of critical cardiac genes and contributing to CHD pathogenesis (Dong2024Discovery).

BMP10 mutations have also been implicated in PAH. Truncating and missense mutations in BMP10 have been identified in young patients with severe PAH, suggesting a potential link between BMP10 mutations and the disease, possibly through an autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance (Morrell2019Finding; Eyries2018Widening). These findings highlight the clinical significance of BMP10 in cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
BMP10 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. It forms complexes with BMPRII (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II), where it binds at the knuckle epitope, involving specific interactions with the A-loop and β4 strand of BMPRII. This interaction is crucial for BMP10's role in signaling pathways, particularly in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Guo2022Crystal). Mutations in BMPRII, such as those in the hydrophobic core and A-loop, can significantly reduce BMP10 binding affinity and disrupt signaling (Guo2022Crystal).

BMP10 also interacts with ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), forming a complex that is essential for endothelial cell signaling. This interaction is mediated by specific conserved regions that contribute to ALK1 specificity (Salmon2020Molecular). BMP10 can form heterodimers with BMP9, which are biologically active and require ALK1 for signaling. This heterodimerization is facilitated by disulfide bonds and is crucial for the biological activity of BMPs in plasma (Tillet2018A).

In cardiac tissue, BMP10 interacts with Tcap (titin-cap), a protein located at the Z disc in cardiomyocytes. This interaction is thought to play a role in modulating hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy by influencing the localization and function of BMP10 in response to increased wall stress (Nakano2007Interaction).
