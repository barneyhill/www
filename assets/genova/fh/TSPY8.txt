# TSPY8

## Overview
TSPY8 is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes the testis-specific protein Y-linked 8. This protein is part of the TSPY gene family, which is known for its role in male germ cell development and spermatogenesis. The TSPY8 protein is categorized as a testis-specific protein, indicating its expression is predominantly restricted to the testes. It is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation within the male reproductive system. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of TSPY8 remain an active area of research, with studies suggesting its involvement in various cellular pathways related to male fertility and potential links to certain disorders when dysregulated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
