# ZNF8

## Overview
ZNF8 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 8, a member of the Kruppel-like family of zinc finger proteins. This protein is characterized by its multiple zinc finger domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger protein 8 contains a conserved Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression and is located in the N-terminal region of the protein (Bellefroid1991The). ZNF8 is expressed in various human tissues and is implicated in several cellular processes, including differentiation and development, through its involvement in the BMP signaling/Smad pathway (Lania1990cDNA; Ganss2004Zinc). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as TRIM28 and RNA-binding proteins, further underscore its regulatory functions in gene expression and chromatin structure (Iguchi2023Zinc; Chang2023AcetylationMimic). ZNF8's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with diseases such as renal cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, as well as its potential involvement in autism spectrum disorders (Wang2021SNPmediated; Gao2024Identification; AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

## Structure
ZNF8 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of multiple zinc finger domains, which are structural motifs stabilized by zinc ions. These domains typically facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins. ZNF8 belongs to the Kruppel-like family of zinc finger proteins and contains a conserved Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is known to form two amphipathic alpha-helices and is involved in transcriptional regulation (Bellefroid1991The). The KRAB domain is located in the N-terminal region of the protein and is associated with the zinc finger repeats found in the C-terminal region (Bellefroid1991The).

The primary structure of ZNF8 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. The secondary structure of these motifs typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, which fold into a stable three-dimensional assembly through hydrophobic interactions and zinc ion coordination (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). ZNF8 is expressed in various human tissues and cell lines, with higher expression levels observed in undifferentiated cells, suggesting a role in developmental regulation (Bellefroid1991The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and stability.

## Function
ZNF8 is a KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It is involved in the BMP signaling/Smad pathway, where it interacts with Smad proteins, particularly Smad1 and Smad5, to regulate transcriptional activity. ZNF8 contains an N-terminal KRAB domain and seven C2H2 zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional repression (Ganss2004Zinc). The protein retains some repressor activity even in the absence of the KRAB domain, suggesting that other motifs within ZNF8 contribute to its function. This indicates that ZNF8 may also compete with transcriptional activators for DNA binding sites, thereby modulating gene expression (Ganss2004Zinc).

ZNF8 is expressed ubiquitously across various human cell lines and is involved in transcriptional regulation due to its zinc finger motifs, which are known for their nucleic acid binding capabilities (Lania1990cDNA). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression patterns, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development (Lania1990cDNA).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF8, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in gene expression and cellular processes. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67311347 enhances the binding of ZNF8, leading to the upregulation of the lncRNA ENTPD3-AS1. This upregulation is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival in RCC patients, suggesting a protective role against the disease (Wang2021SNPmediated).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the lncRNA ZNF8-ERVK3-1 is highly expressed and plays an oncogenic role. Its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Gao2024Identification).

ZNF8 is also listed among zinc finger proteins involved in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), although specific details about its role in these conditions are not provided (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of ZNF8 in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
ZNF8, a zinc finger protein, is involved in interactions with low-complexity (LC) domains of RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPA2, FUS, and TDP43. These interactions are characterized by the binding of ZNF8's zinc finger domain, ZnF8, to LC domains in a polymer-dependent manner. Specific residues in ZnF8, including D1058, K1059, G1061, F1064, Q1072, H1073, and N1075, are crucial for these interactions. This binding suppresses the polymer formation of LC domains, suggesting a regulatory role in phase separation processes (Iguchi2023Zinc).

ZNF8 also interacts with TRIM28, a key epigenetic modifier. In leukemic K562 cells, ZNF8 is associated with both wild-type TRIM28 and its acetylation-mimic mutant, TRIM28-K304Q. This interaction is part of a broader network involving multiple zinc finger proteins and affects gene expression regulation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

Additionally, ZNF8 shares homology with other zinc finger proteins, such as ZNF7 and ZNF2, through a conserved N-terminal module known as the finger preceding box (FPB). This module is involved in protein-nucleic acid interactions, highlighting ZNF8's potential role in transcriptional regulation (Rosati1991Members).
