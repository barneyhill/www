# SLC7A8

## Overview
The SLC7A8 gene encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2), a member of the solute carrier family 7, which is integral to the transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes. LAT2 is a transmembrane protein that operates as a Na+-independent transporter, typically forming a heterodimer with the 4F2hc protein to facilitate its function (Espino2018Mutations; Rossier1999LAT2). This transporter is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the renal proximal tubule, small intestine, blood-brain barrier, and placenta, where it plays a vital role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis (Rossier1999LAT2). LAT2's involvement extends to the transport of thyroid hormones and the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, highlighting its significance in various physiological processes (Espino2018Mutations). Mutations in SLC7A8 have been linked to clinical conditions such as congenital cataracts and age-related hearing loss, underscoring its importance in human health (Espino2018Mutations; Knöpfel2019Dysfunctional).

## Structure
The SLC7A8 gene encodes the L-type amino acid transporter-2 (LAT2), which is part of the solute carrier family 7. LAT2 functions as a Na+-independent transporter of neutral amino acids and typically forms a heterodimer with the 4F2hc protein for its functional activity (Espino2018Mutations). The primary structure of LAT2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form twelve transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of its secondary structure (Jeckelmann2022Structure). These transmembrane domains facilitate the transport of amino acids across the plasma membrane.

The tertiary structure of LAT2 involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function as an amino acid transporter. The quaternary structure is defined by its interaction with the 4F2hc protein, forming a heterodimeric complex that is crucial for its transport activity (Jeckelmann2022Structure). This interaction is stabilized by a disulfide bridge linking the light and heavy subunits (Jeckelmann2022Structure).

Post-translational modifications of LAT2 may include phosphorylation, which can affect its transport activity and regulation. The gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional properties of the transporter (Espino2018Mutations). These structural features are essential for LAT2's role in amino acid homeostasis and its implications in various physiological and pathological conditions.

## Function
The SLC7A8 gene encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2), which is involved in the Na+-independent transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes. This transporter functions as part of a heterodimer with the 4F2hc/CD98 protein, facilitating the exchange of amino acids with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Espino2018Mutations; Rossier1999LAT2). LAT2 is primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubule, small intestine, blood-brain barrier, and placenta, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis by equilibrating amino acid concentrations across the plasma membrane (Espino2018Mutations; Rossier1999LAT2).

In the kidney and intestine, LAT2 is localized to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, where it is involved in the reabsorption and transport of amino acids, contributing to systemic amino acid homeostasis (Rossier1999LAT2). The transporter is essential for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis and metabolic regulation, by ensuring the availability of amino acids necessary for these functions (Hurkmans2022SLC7A8). LAT2 also plays a role in the transport of thyroid hormones and the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, indicating its involvement in broader physiological processes (Espino2018Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC7A8 gene, which encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2), have been associated with several clinical conditions. In humans, mutations in SLC7A8 are linked to cataract formation, particularly congenital cataracts. A specific homozygous mutation involving a single nucleotide deletion leads to a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, affecting its subcellular localization and preventing it from reaching the plasma membrane. This mutation was identified in two siblings with congenital cataracts, while their parents were heterozygous for the mutation (Knöpfel2019Dysfunctional).

SLC7A8 is also implicated in age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Mutations in this gene can lead to structural and functional changes in the cochlea, contributing to hearing impairment. Specific variants such as p.Val302Ile, p.Arg418His, p.Thr402Met, and p.Val460Glu have been identified in ARHL patients, showing decreased transport activity. These mutations are associated with defective amino acid transport, which is implicated in the development of ARHL (Espino2018Mutations).

In osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor, the SLC7A8 locus has been associated with early disease progression during chemotherapy. LAT2 transports doxorubicin, and its lack of expression is linked to poor prognosis and reduced overall survival in patients without metastases (Hurkmans2022SLC7A8).

## Interactions
The SLC7A8 gene encodes the LAT2 protein, which is involved in amino acid transport. LAT2 forms a heterodimeric complex with the 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc or CD98hc), a glycoprotein essential for its functional expression and localization to the cell surface. This interaction is crucial for the transport of neutral amino acids across cell membranes (Rossier1999LAT2). The LAT2-4F2hc complex facilitates the uptake and efflux of amino acids, with LAT2 showing a higher affinity for certain amino acids like L-alanine and L-glutamine compared to its homolog LAT1 (Rossier1999LAT2).

LAT2 does not interact with rBAT in the kidney and intestine, a peculiarity observed in the Xenopus oocyte system, indicating a specific interaction with 4F2hc for its transport function (Rossier1999LAT2). In the context of osteosarcoma, LAT2 has been shown to transport the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, suggesting a role in drug response and potential implications for treatment strategies (Hurkmans2022SLC7A8). The LAT2-4F2hc interaction is also implicated in maintaining lens transparency in the eye, with defects in LAT2 linked to cataract formation (Knöpfel2019Dysfunctional).
