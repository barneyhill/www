# MLLT11

## Overview
MLLT11, also known as AF1q, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein encoded by MLLT11 functions as a transcription factor cofactor, particularly interacting with T-cell Factor 7 (TCF7) in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation (Parcelier2011AF1qMLLT11). MLLT11 is implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis, influencing the development and function of different cell types, such as neuroblasts and hematopoietic progenitor cells (Blommers2022Retinal; Parcelier2011AF1qMLLT11). The gene's expression and its protein interactions are significant in various pathological conditions, including cancer and endometriosis, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the context (Li2018Novel; Proestling2023MLLT11).

## Function
The MLLT11 gene, also known as AF1q, plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. MLLT11 interacts with the cytoskeleton, particularly with tubulins and atypical myosins, to regulate the morphology and migration of neuroblasts, which is crucial for the proper lamination of the retina and the development of the ganglion cell layer (Blommers2022Retinal). In the context of hematopoietic progenitor cells, MLLT11 enhances the susceptibility of these cells to Notch signaling, promoting T-cell differentiation while restricting B-cell development (Parcelier2011AF1qMLLT11).

MLLT11 is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis sensitivity in endometrial stroma cells. Its knockdown leads to cell cycle disruption, with an increase in G1 phase cells and a decrease in S and G2/M phases, associated with the upregulation of cell cycle checkpoint proteins p21 and p27 (Proestling2023MLLT11). Additionally, MLLT11 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and contributes to normal cellular functions through its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with transcription factor 7 (TCF7) in the Wnt signaling pathway.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MLLT11 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of glioma, MLLT11 expression is associated with different molecular subtypes and patient prognoses. Higher expression levels correlate with better outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2022Identification). In endometriosis, MLLT11 is significantly downregulated in the stromal cells of ectopic lesions, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. This downregulation is linked to increased cell adhesion, reduced proliferation, and decreased sensitivity to apoptosis, contributing to the pathophysiology of endometriosis (Proestling2023MLLT11).

MLLT11 also plays a role in cancer, acting as an oncogene in some contexts and a tumor suppressor in others. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), overexpression of MLLT11 enhances cell proliferation and resistance to treatment, while its knockdown increases sensitivity to imatinib, a common CML therapy (Li2018Novel). In ovarian cancer, MLLT11 is associated with poor outcomes due to its role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition, enhancing cell invasiveness and motility (Proestling2023MLLT11).

## Interactions
The MLLT11 gene, also known as AF1q, encodes a protein that participates in several significant interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. One of the primary interactions of MLLT11 is with T-cell Factor 7 (TCF7), a component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of the CD44 gene, which is implicated in breast cancer metastasis (Khan2020Recombinant; Park2015AF1q). The interaction between AF1q and TCF7 specifically involves the high-mobility group (HMG) domain of TCF7 (Khan2020Recombinant).

MLLT11 also plays a role in the Notch signaling pathway, where it enhances the susceptibility of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells to Notch-induced signals. This interaction promotes T-cell over B-cell differentiation, indicating a cooperative role with the Notch pathway in T-cell lineage specification (Parcelier2011AF1qMLLT11). The protein's degradation is mediated by the proteasome following ubiquitylation, and its nuclear export is CRM1-dependent, highlighting its regulated subcellular localization and stability (Parcelier2011AF1qMLLT11).

These interactions underscore MLLT11's involvement in critical signaling pathways that influence cell differentiation and cancer progression.
