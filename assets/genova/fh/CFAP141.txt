# CFAP141

## Overview
CFAP141, or cilia and flagella associated protein 141, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia in human cells. The protein is categorized as a microtubule inner protein (MIP) and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are essential for cellular processes such as movement and sensory functions. CFAP141 interacts with other proteins, including NME7 and CFAP53, to ensure the structural integrity of cilia by contributing to the assembly of the cilia outer doublet. This interaction is facilitated by the ELLEn module within CFAP141, which binds to NME7, underscoring its critical role in cilia assembly (Andersen2024Uncovering). The gene is highly expressed in late mature ciliated cells, indicating its importance in the later stages of cilia development (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional). Mutations or alterations in CFAP141 are linked to disrupted ciliary function and are implicated in various ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Brody2024Loss).

## Function
CFAP141, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 141, plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia in human cells. It is involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes, including movement and sensory functions. CFAP141 is part of a group of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that contribute to the architectural integrity of cilia by interacting with other proteins such as NME7 and CFAP53. This interaction is vital for the assembly of the cilia outer doublet, which is necessary for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering).

The ELLEn module within CFAP141 is responsible for binding to NME7, a protein associated with cilia, indicating its critical role in cilia assembly and function (Andersen2024Uncovering). CFAP141 is highly expressed in late mature ciliated cells, suggesting its importance in the later stages of cilia assembly (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional). The absence of CFAP141 in certain genetic variants is linked to disrupted ciliary function, highlighting its significance in maintaining ciliary structure and function (Brody2024Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CFAP141 gene have been implicated in various ciliopathies, which are disorders arising from dysfunctional cilia. Although specific diseases directly linked to CFAP141 mutations are not extensively documented, the gene is structurally and functionally related to other ciliary proteins, suggesting its potential importance in ciliary function and related disorders (Andersen2024Uncovering). 

In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), CFAP141, also known as C1ORF189, shows differential expression during the maturation of ciliated cells, with low expression in early mature ciliated cells and high expression in late mature ciliated cells. This pattern suggests that CFAP141 may play a role in the later stages of cilia assembly, potentially affecting the organization of ciliary motors and their regulatory components (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional).

Additionally, the absence of CFAP141 has been observed in cilia from CCDC39 variants, which are associated with motile ciliopathies. This absence may contribute to abnormal ciliary function, highlighting the potential impact of CFAP141 on ciliary structure and function (Brody2024Loss). Changes in CFAP141 abundance have also been noted in the context of altered alpha-tubulin acetylation, which affects the protein composition of doublet microtubules (Yang2024Effect).

## Interactions
CFAP141 interacts with several proteins through the ELLEn module, a conserved NME7- and tubulin-binding module. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the cilia outer doublet. CFAP141, along with CFAP53 and TCHP, binds to NME7, which is essential for tubulin contacts on both the A and B tubules. These interactions are significant for cilia function and centriole assembly, with mutations in NME7 and CFAP53 linked to situs inversus totalis, highlighting their clinical importance (Andersen2024Uncovering).

CFAP141 is part of a group of axonemal outer junction-spanning microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that interact with NWE module-containing MIPs, suggesting a role in cilia architecture. The ELLEn module shows strict homology in terms of residues and peptide steric distance, indicating evolutionary and structural relationships (Andersen2024Uncovering).

CFAP141 also forms complexes with NWE-containing proteins such as FAP67 and NME7. These complexes are important for linking the A- and B-tubule via the outer junction intersection, which is essential for the assembly of the outer doublet in cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering).
