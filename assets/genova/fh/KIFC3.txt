# KIFC3

## Overview
KIFC3 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member C3, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-14 family. This protein is characterized by its C-terminal motor domain, which facilitates minus-end-directed movement along microtubules, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport processes (Hirokawa2004Kinesin). KIFC3 is involved in the positioning and maintenance of the Golgi apparatus and peroxisomes, particularly under conditions of cellular stress or cholesterol depletion (Xu2002Role; Dietrich2013Identification). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as CENEXIN1 and PEX1, underscore its importance in cellular senescence and organelle positioning (Dietrich2013Identification; Robichaud2024Transiently). Clinically, alterations in KIFC3 expression have been linked to cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance, making it a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response (Zhao2024The; Tan2011Specific).

## Structure
The KIFC3 protein is a member of the kinesin-14 family, characterized by a C-terminal motor domain that facilitates minus-end-directed movement along microtubules (Hirokawa2004Kinesin). The primary structure of KIFC3 includes a conserved motor domain, which is responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, and a tail domain that is intrinsically disordered, allowing for cargo binding and regulatory interactions (Seeger2012Kinesin). 

The secondary structure of KIFC3 is predicted to include alpha-helical regions, particularly in the coiled-coil stalk domain, which facilitates oligomerization (Hu2015Gene). The tertiary structure features a globular head domain, which contains the motor domain, and a fan-like tail domain (Hu2015Gene). The quaternary structure often involves dimerization, which is common among kinesin proteins, although specific details for KIFC3 are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the motor activity of KIFC3, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure allows it to play a significant role in intracellular transport and cellular processes like spermatogenesis (Hu2015Gene).

## Function
KIFC3 is a motor protein that plays a crucial role in the positioning and integration of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. It is primarily localized in the Golgi region of adrenocortical cells and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus, particularly under conditions of cholesterol depletion (Xu2002Role). KIFC3 functions as a microtubule minus-end-directed motor protein, facilitating the centripetal movement of Golgi fragments along microtubules, which is essential for proper Golgi positioning and reassembly (Xu2002Role).

In addition to its role in Golgi apparatus maintenance, KIFC3 is involved in the positioning and transport of peroxisomes within mammalian cells. It interacts with the human peroxin PEX1, influencing peroxisomal distribution by potentially regulating dynein motor function at peroxisomes (Dietrich2013Identification). Knockdown of KIFC3 results in increased perinuclear clustering of peroxisomes, indicating its role in peroxisomal transport and distribution (Dietrich2013Identification).

KIFC3 is expressed ubiquitously but is particularly abundant in tissues such as the kidney, testis, and adrenal glands, suggesting a general role in intracellular transport across various cell types (Xu2002Role; Yang2001Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KIFC3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and cellular senescence. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KIFC3 is upregulated, which correlates with poor overall survival outcomes for patients. This suggests that KIFC3 expression levels may serve as a prognostic marker in HCC (Zhao2024The). KIFC3 is also involved in promoting HCC development through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and its inhibition, in combination with PI3K inhibitors, shows a synergistic effect in reducing tumor growth (Zhao2024The).

In breast cancer, overexpression of KIFC3 is associated with resistance to taxane-based chemotherapies, such as docetaxel and paclitaxel, in basal-like breast cancer. This resistance is specific to taxanes and not observed with non-taxane chemotherapies, indicating that KIFC3 may be a potential biomarker for predicting chemotherapy response (Tan2011Specific).

KIFC3 also plays a critical role in cellular senescence, particularly in stressed cells. Its deficiency disrupts the transport of key proteins necessary for senescence initiation, highlighting its importance in stress response regulation (Robichaud2024Transiently). These findings suggest that KIFC3 is significant in both cancer progression and cellular aging processes.

## Interactions
KIFC3, a minus-end-directed kinesin, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In the context of cellular senescence, KIFC3 interacts with the centrosomal protein CENEXIN1. This interaction is important for the nuclear transport of FBF1, a component of transition fibers at the base of primary cilia, which is essential for senescence induction. KIFC3 does not directly interact with FBF1 but facilitates its translocation to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in stressed cells through its association with CENEXIN1 (Robichaud2024Transiently).

In the context of organelle positioning, KIFC3 interacts with the AAA-protein PEX1, influencing peroxisomal motility. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies in human fibroblasts (Dietrich2013Identification).

KIFC3 also plays a role in Golgi apparatus positioning, particularly under cholesterol-depleted conditions, where it works synergistically with cytoplasmic dynein (CyDy) to maintain Golgi integrity. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and integration of the Golgi apparatus (Xu2002Role).
