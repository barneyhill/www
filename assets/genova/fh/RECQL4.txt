# RECQL4

## Overview
RECQL4 is a gene that encodes the RecQ like helicase 4 protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. The protein is characterized by its helicase activity, which is essential for DNA repair, replication, and recombination processes. RecQ like helicase 4 is unique among its family members due to its presence in both the nucleus and mitochondria, suggesting a role in mitochondrial DNA maintenance as well as nuclear DNA processes (Luong2021Role; Kaiser2017The). The protein's structure includes several distinct domains, such as a Zn2+-binding domain and a central ATPase domain, which are vital for its function in DNA substrate binding and helicase activity (Kaiser2017The). Mutations in the RECQL4 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and have implications in cancer development, highlighting its clinical significance (Siitonen2008The; Guo2020RECQL4).

## Structure
The human RECQL4 protein is a member of the RecQ helicase family, characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of RECQL4 consists of 1208 amino acids, forming a 133 kDa protein (Kaiser2017The). The N-terminal region of RECQL4 is largely unstructured but contains multiple DNA-binding domains, including a homeodomain-like fold in the first 54 amino acids, which is involved in DNA interaction (Keller2014The; Ohlenschläger2012The). This region also shows homology to the yeast Sld2 protein, essential for DNA replication initiation (Kaiser2017The).

The secondary structure of the N-terminal domain includes three alpha-helices connected by short loops, resembling a helix-turn-helix motif (Ohlenschläger2012The). The tertiary structure of RECQL4 features a Zn2+-binding domain, which is distinct from the conserved RQC domain found in other RecQ helicases, and is involved in DNA substrate binding (Kaiser2017The). The protein also contains a central ATPase domain crucial for its helicase activity (Kaiser2017The).

RECQL4 is unique among RecQ helicases as it is found in mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus, suggesting a role in mtDNA replication or maintenance (Kaiser2017The). The protein's N-terminal region is involved in ATP-independent DNA strand exchange and shows a preference for GC-rich DNA (Keller2014The).

## Function
RECQL4 is a crucial gene in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It encodes a protein that is part of the RecQ helicase family, which is involved in DNA repair, replication, and recombination. RECQL4 plays a significant role in the initiation of DNA replication by interacting with the CMG complex (CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS) and other replication initiation proteins, ensuring proper loading onto chromatin for DNA synthesis (Luong2021Role; Mo2018Human). It is also involved in telomere maintenance, working with the Shelterin complex to resolve telomeric D-loops, which is essential for preventing telomere fragility and dysfunction (Luong2021Role; Ghosh2012RECQL4).

RECQL4 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, with its localization regulated by acetylation. It is unique among RecQ helicases for its mitochondrial localization, which is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance (Luong2021Role). The protein is involved in various DNA repair pathways, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and double-strand break repair, interacting with proteins like XPA, MRE11, and KU70 to facilitate these processes (Luong2021Role). Its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which modulate its function during the cell cycle (Luong2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RECQL4 gene are associated with several autosomal recessive syndromes, including Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), RAPADILINO syndrome, and Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS). These conditions share features such as growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities. RTS is characterized by poikiloderma, sparse hair, short stature, and dental anomalies, with a significant risk of developing osteosarcoma and skin cancers like basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas (Siitonen2008The; Wang2019Rothmund–Thomson). RAPADILINO syndrome includes short stature and joint dislocations, with an increased risk of osteosarcoma and lymphoma (Maciaszek2019Enrichment). BGS is marked by craniosynostosis and radial ray defects (Maciaszek2019Enrichment).

Alterations in RECQL4 expression are linked to cancer development. Overexpression of RECQL4 is observed in various cancers, including ovarian cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance (Guo2020RECQL4). In contrast, RECQL4 deficiency is linked to increased susceptibility to osteosarcoma, highlighting its complex role in cancer (Mo2018Human). RECQL4 also plays a role in DNA repair pathways, and its interaction with proteins like p53 and PARP-1 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Mo2018Human).

## Interactions
RECQL4 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes, particularly DNA repair and replication. It forms a stable complex with ubiquitin ligases UBR1 and UBR2, which are part of the N-end rule pathway. This interaction is significant in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, where RECQL4 predominantly resides, although it is also present in the nucleus (Yin2004RECQL4). RECQL4 also interacts with Rad51, a protein involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This interaction is crucial for RECQL4's recruitment to sites of DNA damage, where it colocalizes with Rad51 foci (Petkovic2005The).

In the context of DNA replication, RECQL4 is essential for the assembly of the CMG (Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS) complex. Its depletion disrupts the interactions between CMG proteins, indicating its critical role in the assembly and chromatin recruitment of these proteins (Im2009Assembly). RECQL4 also interacts with the MRN complex and Ku heterodimer, which are essential for initiating homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, respectively. These interactions are regulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation, which influences RECQL4's role in DNA repair pathways (Lu2017Cell).
