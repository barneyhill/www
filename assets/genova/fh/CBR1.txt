# CBR1

## Overview
CBR1, or carbonyl reductase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. The CBR1 protein is a monomeric enzyme that plays a crucial role in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, utilizing NADPH as a cofactor. It is primarily involved in the metabolism of a wide array of endogenous and xenobiotic substrates, including drugs, prostaglandins, and reactive carbonyls, thereby contributing significantly to detoxification processes and cellular redox balance (Boušová2015The; Hoffmann2007Carbonyl). The enzyme is particularly active in the liver and intestinal mucosa and is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced damage (Boušová2015The; Hoffmann2007Carbonyl). CBR1's activity is also implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological processes (Rashid2016Detoxification; Tak2011Human).

## Structure
The human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) protein is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and consists of 276 amino acids (Liang2015Structural). Its secondary structure is composed of 11 alpha-helices and 8 beta-strands, forming a monomeric protein (Liang2015Structural). CBR1 features a Rossmann fold, a common structural motif for nucleotide binding, which is crucial for its interaction with the coenzyme NADPH (Liang2015Structural). 

The protein's tertiary structure includes a positively charged cavity where NADPH binds, and a relatively neutral region for glutathione (GSH) binding, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Liang2015Structural). The interaction with GSH involves potential hydrogen bonds with several residues, indicating a fixed configuration for the GSH-glutamate moiety, while the GSH-glycine moiety forms weaker hydrogen bonds (Liang2015Structural). 

CBR1 does not typically form a quaternary structure, as it functions as a monomer (Liang2015Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variant isoforms of CBR1 could contribute to structural and functional diversity, but specific variants are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
Carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a significant role in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, utilizing NADPH as a cofactor. It is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic substrates, including drugs, prostaglandins, and reactive carbonyls (Boušová2015The; Hoffmann2007Carbonyl). CBR1 is particularly active in the liver and intestinal mucosa, where it contributes to drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Boušová2015The).

In healthy human cells, CBR1 is involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins, acting as a prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, which are crucial for controlling prostaglandin levels under various physiological conditions (Boušová2015The). It also plays a role in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthase (Boušová2015The).

CBR1 is essential for detoxifying reactive aldehydes and ketones produced during oxidative stress, protecting neuronal cells from oxidative stress-induced damage (Boušová2015The; Hoffmann2007Carbonyl). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress, contributing to the survival and function of various cell types, including neuronal and pancreatic β-cells (Boušová2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CBR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, CBR1 is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, contributing to resistance against apoptosis and chemoresistance to drugs like cisplatin and doxorubicin. This suggests that CBR1 plays a role in tumor growth and survival, making it a potential target for overcoming chemoresistance in HCC (Tak2011Human). 

CBR1 is also implicated in the detoxification of reactive aldehydes and ketones, which are linked to oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Its role in reducing oxidative stress is crucial for protecting neuronal cells from damage (Rashid2016Detoxification). 

In the context of cardiovascular health, CBR1 is involved in the metabolism of anthracycline drugs, which can lead to cardiotoxicity. Variations in CBR1 activity, potentially due to genetic polymorphisms, may influence the risk of developing cardiotoxicity from these drugs (GonzalezCovarrubias2007A). 

CBR1 expression is also increased in various cancers, including lung, breast, liver, intestine, and colon cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Shi2017The).

## Interactions
CBR1 (carbonyl reductase 1) is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CBR1 acts as a reductase for Dph3, a protein involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide and tRNA wobble uridine modifications. This interaction is significant for the reduction of Dph3, which is crucial for modifications important for translation elongation. CBR1 reduces Dph3 in vitro using NADH, indicating its specificity for this cofactor (Lin2016Cbr1).

In humans, CBR1 is involved in the reduction of anthracycline anti-tumor drugs such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin, which are associated with cardiotoxicity due to their reduced metabolites. Curcumin, a natural phenol, is identified as a potent inhibitor of CBR1, suggesting a potential interaction where curcumin binds to CBR1 and inhibits its activity. This inhibition is characterized as non-competitive with respect to the substrate 2,3-hexandione and likely competitive with respect to NADPH (Hintzpeter2015Curcumin).

CBR1 also undergoes posttranslational modification through S-glutathionylation, which affects its activity. This modification involves the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, potentially altering the enzyme's conformation and substrate binding (Hartmanová2013SNitrosoglutathione).
