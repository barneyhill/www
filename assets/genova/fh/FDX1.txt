# FDX1

## Overview
The FDX1 gene encodes the mitochondrial protein ferredoxin 1, which is a small iron-sulfur protein involved in electron transfer processes. Ferredoxin 1 plays a crucial role in steroidogenesis, particularly in the adrenal glands, by facilitating the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones through the reduction of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes (Wang2022High; Sheftel2010Humans). This protein is characterized by its [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster, which is essential for its electron transfer capabilities and structural integrity (Cai2017Human). FDX1 is highly expressed in tissues with significant steroidogenic activity, such as the adrenal gland, kidney, and testes (Sheftel2010Humans). Beyond its role in steroid hormone biosynthesis, FDX1 is involved in protein interactions crucial for cellular processes, including protein lipoylation and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, although it is less efficient in the latter compared to its paralog FDX2 (Cai2017Human; Dreishpoon2023FDX1). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Huang2022FDX1; Li2022Characterization).

## Structure
Human mitochondrial ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) is a small iron-sulfur protein involved in electron transfer processes. The primary structure of FDX1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of FDX1 is a compact, globular form, which is stabilized by the presence of a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster. This cluster is crucial for the protein's electron transfer capabilities and structural integrity (Cai2017Human).

FDX1 functions as a monomer and does not exhibit a quaternary structure. The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions with other proteins. The presence of conserved cysteine residues in FDX1 is essential for ligating the [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is a common feature among ferredoxins (Cai2017Human).

The crystal structure of human oxidized FDX1 has been determined and is available under PDB ID 3P1M, providing detailed insights into its molecular conformation and the arrangement of its iron-sulfur cluster (Cai2017Human).

## Function
The FDX1 gene encodes ferredoxin 1, a mitochondrial protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, FDX1 plays a pivotal role in steroidogenesis, particularly in the adrenal glands, where it facilitates the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as pregnenolone, aldosterone, and cortisol. This process involves the reduction of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are essential for steroid hormone biosynthesis (Wang2022High; Sheftel2010Humans).

FDX1 is also involved in the electron transfer process, where it transfers electrons from NADPH to cytochrome P450 via ferredoxin reductase. This function is crucial for the metabolism of steroids, vitamin D, and bile acids (Yang2022Ferredoxin). Although FDX1 can participate in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly, it is less efficient than its counterpart, FDX2, in this role. FDX2 is more physiologically relevant for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis due to its higher binding affinity and efficiency (Cai2017Human).

FDX1 is highly expressed in tissues with significant steroidogenic activity, such as the adrenal gland, kidney, and testes, aligning with its role in steroid hormone production (Sheftel2010Humans).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FDX1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. FDX1 expression is dysregulated in various tumors, with its levels varying significantly across different cancer types. For instance, FDX1 is downregulated in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), while it is upregulated in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (Li2022Characterization). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FDX1 is downregulated, and its high expression is associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Huang2022FDX1).

FDX1 is also involved in the tumor-immune microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration, which can stratify risk and predict prognosis in cancers like ccRCC (Huang2022FDX1). Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, showing varying correlations across different tumors (Li2022Characterization). Additionally, FDX1 is implicated in metabolic dysregulation, which may contribute to cancer development (Huang2022FDX1). These findings highlight the gene's role in tumor progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FDX1, a human mitochondrial ferredoxin, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It directly binds to lipoyl synthase (LIAS), playing a significant role in protein lipoylation, a post-translational modification essential for mitochondrial enzyme function. This interaction is vital for maintaining cell viability, particularly under low glucose conditions (Dreishpoon2023FDX1). FDX1's binding to LIAS has been confirmed through various experimental techniques, including a Nano-Luc complementation assay and Microscale Thermophoresis, which demonstrated a binding affinity with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 6 µM (Dreishpoon2023FDX1).

FDX1 also interacts with proteins involved in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, such as cysteine desulfurase, although it is less efficient than its paralog FDX2 in this role (Cai2017Human). In the context of steroid biosynthesis, FDX1 supports electron transfer to cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP11A1, which is crucial for steroid hormone production (Wang2022Cuproptosisrelated). These interactions highlight FDX1's multifaceted role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.
