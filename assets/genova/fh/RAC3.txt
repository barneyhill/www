# RAC3

## Overview
RAC3 is a gene that encodes the Rac family small GTPase 3 protein, a member of the Rac family of small GTPases. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. As a small GTPase, Rac family small GTPase 3 functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, thereby regulating downstream signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-AhR-Sim (PAS) domains, which are typical of transcriptional regulators, and it undergoes post-translational modifications that affect its subcellular localization and function (Li1997RAC3; Scala2021Pathophysiological). RAC3 is implicated in critical cellular functions such as integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading, and it plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in prostate and breast cancers, where its expression correlates with disease severity and metastatic potential (Gnanapragasam2001Expression; Haataja2002The).

## Structure
The RAC3 protein is a member of the Rac family of small GTPases, characterized by its involvement in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. The primary structure of RAC3 consists of 1417 amino acids, forming a 154.4-kDa protein (Li1997RAC3). It contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and two Per-AhR-Sim (PAS) domains, which are common in transcriptional regulators (Li1997RAC3). The central region of RAC3 includes six LXXLL or LLXXL motifs, important for protein-protein interactions, and these motifs are predicted to form α-helical structures (Li1997RAC3). The C-terminal region is glutamine-rich, featuring a unique stretch of 26 consecutive glutamine residues, a characteristic of transcriptional coactivators (Li1997RAC3).

RAC3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including isoprenylation, endoproteolysis, and carboxyl methylation, which influence its subcellular localization (Scala2021Pathophysiological). The protein's structure is further defined by the presence of Switch I and Switch II domains, which are crucial for its active GTP-bound state and interactions with downstream effectors (Scala2021Pathophysiological). These domains undergo conformational changes essential for RAC3's function as a molecular switch (Scala2021Pathophysiological).

## Function
RAC3, a member of the Rac family of small GTPases, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is crucial for cell shape and motility. In healthy human cells, RAC3 is involved in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading, specifically through its interaction with the calcium-and integrin-binding protein (CIB). This interaction is essential for integrin αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen, a process important for cellular functions such as migration and tissue organization (Haataja2002The).

RAC3 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with other proteins to mediate signal transduction pathways that affect cell growth and survival. The binding of RAC3 to CIB is mediated by the C-terminal end of RAC3 and its membrane localization, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion processes (Haataja2002The). During cell adhesion on fibrinogen, RAC3 levels increase in the Triton-insoluble fraction of the cell, and CIB co-localizes with active RAC3 at the cell periphery, indicating its role in cytoskeletal reorganization (Haataja2002The).

## Clinical Significance
RAC3, a member of the Rac family of small GTPases, plays a significant role in cancer progression through its involvement in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and migration. Alterations in RAC3 expression have been linked to various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, RAC3 expression is associated with higher Gleason scores and advanced tumor stages, indicating a correlation with more severe disease and poorer survival outcomes (Gnanapragasam2001Expression). In breast cancer, RAC3 is constitutively active in highly proliferative cell lines, promoting cell growth and invasion, which suggests its role in enhancing metastatic potential (del2005Rho; Baugher2005Rac1).

RAC3's interaction with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer enhances AR transcriptional activity, which may contribute to disease progression (Gnanapragasam2001Expression). In breast cancer, active RAC3 mutants increase cell adhesion and migration, further implicating its role in metastasis (Baugher2005Rac1). These findings highlight RAC3 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment, given its involvement in tumor growth and metastasis. The gene's expression is tissue-specific, being present in the heart, placenta, muscle, pancreas, and prostate, but not in the lung, liver, brain, or kidney (Gnanapragasam2001Expression).

## Interactions
RAC3, a member of the Rac family of small GTPases, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts specifically with the integrin-binding protein CIB1, a relationship that is crucial for integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading. This interaction is unique to RAC3, as it does not occur with other Rac isoforms like Rac1 or Rac2, and is mediated by the C-terminal end of RAC3 (Haataja2002The).

RAC3 is also involved in the formation and function of invadopodia, actin-rich protrusions that facilitate tumor cell invasion. It is recruited to invadopodia by CIB1 and promotes integrin activation, which is essential for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and metastasis in breast cancer cells (Donnelly2017Rac3). The activity of RAC3 at invadopodia is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Vav2 and βPIX, which control its spatiotemporal dynamics and impact the localization of the effector GIT1. GIT1 is involved in the vesicular trafficking of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), crucial for ECM degradation (Donnelly2017Rac3).

In neuronal development, RAC3 interacts with β1-spectrin, an actin organizer, which is involved in dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation (de2019The). This interaction highlights RAC3's role in modulating dendritic spine dynamics and its importance in cognitive functions.
