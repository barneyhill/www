# OSBPL5

## Overview
OSBPL5 is a gene that encodes the protein oxysterol-binding protein-like 5 (ORP5), which is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. This family is characterized by its role in lipid metabolism and transport, particularly involving sterols and phosphoinositides. ORP5 is categorized as a lipid transfer protein, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphatidylinositol homeostasis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane contact sites. The protein is involved in the exchange of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate with phosphatidylserine, which is essential for membrane homeostasis and cellular survival (Shang2020CircRNA0001449; Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding). The gene is located on chromosome 11p15.4 and is known to produce several splice variant isoforms, suggesting diverse regulatory mechanisms and functional specialization within different cellular contexts (Lehto2003The).

## Structure
OSBPL5, a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, is characterized by its oxysterol-binding domain (ORD), which is crucial for binding sterols and phosphoinositides. This domain is conserved across the OSBP family and is involved in lipid transport and signaling (Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding). The protein may also contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitates membrane association by recognizing phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) (Pietrangelo2018Bridging). 

OSBPL5 is classified within subgroup B1 of the OSBP family, sharing sequence similarities with OSBPL8 (Jaworski2001A). The protein structure includes a predicted C-terminal transmembrane segment, which targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), similar to its human ortholog ORP5 (Zhou2014A). This structural feature is significant for its function in lipid transport.

The gene encoding OSBPL5 is located on chromosome 11p15.4 and is known to produce several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles and localization (Lehto2003The). These isoforms suggest a potential for diverse regulatory mechanisms and functional specialization within different cellular contexts.

## Function
OSBPL5, also known as ORP5, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport. In healthy human cells, OSBPL5 is involved in maintaining phosphatidylinositol (PI) homeostasis and is active at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites. It facilitates the exchange of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] with phosphatidylserine (PS), which is essential for membrane homeostasis and cellular survival (Shang2020CircRNA0001449).

OSBPL5's activity is significant in regulating AKT phosphorylation, a process vital for cell survival, growth, and differentiation. The protein's function in lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways is critical for normal cellular functions, particularly under stress conditions like ischemia (Shang2020CircRNA0001449). Although the specific function of OSBPL5 in healthy cells is not extensively detailed, it is suggested that it plays a role in intracellular lipid signaling and homeostasis, influencing cellular lipid distribution and potentially impacting processes like cell signaling and membrane trafficking (Lehto2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the OSBPL5 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), OSBPL5 is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of OSBPL5 in NSCLC cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Hu2022RETRACTED). The gene is also a downstream target of miR-526b-3p, and its expression is modulated by the long noncoding RNA LMCD1-AS1, which acts as a sponge for miR-526b-3p, influencing NSCLC cell behavior (Hu2022RETRACTED).

In Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS), an epigenetic disorder, OSBPL5 shows significant hypomethylation at the site cg25963939. This hypomethylation is associated with clinical manifestations of SRS, such as growth retardation and low birth weight (Wu2017Genomewide).

In the context of transient cerebral ischemia, OSBPL5, through its product ORP5, affects phosphatidylinositol homeostasis and AKT activity, which are crucial for cell protection during ischemic injury. Alterations in OSBPL5 expression, potentially regulated by miRNAs, could influence the cellular response to ischemic injury (Shang2020CircRNA0001449).

## Interactions
OSBPL5, through its protein product ORP5, is involved in several interactions that regulate lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways. ORP5 plays a role in the transport of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its derivatives between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for maintaining membrane lipid composition and influencing AKT activity, a key signaling molecule involved in cell survival and apoptosis (Shang2020CircRNA0001449). 

In the context of transient cerebral ischemia, OSBPL5 is regulated by microRNAs, specifically miR-124-3p and miR-32-5p, which bind to its mRNA and affect its translation. The circular RNA circRNA_0001449 acts as a molecular sponge for these microRNAs, enhancing the translation of OSBPL5 and thereby influencing ORP5 protein levels (Shang2020CircRNA0001449). This interaction affects the levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 in the plasma membrane, impairing AKT activation and promoting cell apoptosis and autophagy after ischemic injury (Shang2020CircRNA0001449).

In lung cancer, OSBPL5 is overexpressed in metastatic tissues and is associated with increased invasiveness of cancer cells. Its expression is regulated by miR-526b-3p, with the long noncoding RNA LMCD1-AS1 acting as a competing endogenous RNA that sponges miR-526b-3p, thereby modulating OSBPL5 expression (Hu2022RETRACTED).
