# ASPG

## Overview
The ASPG gene encodes the enzyme asparaginase, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various biochemical processes within the human body. Asparaginase, categorized as a hydrolase enzyme, primarily functions to hydrolyze L-asparagine into L-aspartate and ammonia, a reaction that is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, as many tumor cells rely on external sources of L-asparagine for survival (Belviso2017The). The enzyme also exhibits lysophospholipase, transacylase, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase activities, contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation and modulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity (Belviso2017The). Structurally, the asparaginase domain of the ASPG protein shares similarities with bacterial asparaginases, such as those from E. coli, and is characterized by a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets (Karamitros2014Human). The enzyme's activity is subject to allosteric regulation, and it does not exhibit lysophospholipase activity despite being part of a larger lysophospholipase protein (Karamitros2014Human).

## Structure
The human ASPG gene encodes an enzyme with an N-terminal L-asparaginase domain, which is structurally similar to bacterial asparaginases. The primary structure of the enzyme includes critical residues for catalysis, such as Thr19, Thr116, Asp117, and Lys188, which align with those in E. coli asparaginase (Karamitros2014Human). The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of asparaginase enzymes, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of the human asparaginase domain has been modeled based on the crystal structure of E. coli asparaginase, revealing a similar folding pattern that supports its enzymatic function (Karamitros2014Human). The enzyme primarily exists as a monomer with a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa, but the presence of L-asparagine can induce the formation of higher molecular weight species, suggesting potential dimer or tetramer formation (Karamitros2014Human).

The enzyme exhibits non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics, indicative of allosteric regulation, with specific residues in the allosteric site differing from those in E. coli asparaginase (Karamitros2014Human). The ASPG gene product does not show lysophospholipase activity, despite being part of a larger lysophospholipase protein (Karamitros2014Human).

## Function
The ASPG protein, also known as 60 kDa Lysophospholipase, is an enzyme with multiple activities, including asparaginase, lysophospholipase, transacylase, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase activities. In healthy human cells, ASPG is involved in regulating cell proliferation and down-regulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, which is associated with decreased cell malignancy (Belviso2017The). Its lysophospholipase activity plays a critical role in controlling cell proliferation by mediating the conversion of lysophosphatidylinositol into glycerophosphoinositol, an important intracellular messenger derived from the RAS pathway (Belviso2017The).

ASPG's asparaginase activity hydrolyzes L-asparagine into L-aspartate and ammonia, a process that is critical for tumor cells but dispensable for healthy cells, which can synthesize L-asparagine (Belviso2017The). The PAF acetylhydrolase activity of ASPG converts PAF into a biologically inactive form, potentially decreasing PAF levels and contrasting tumorigenesis (Belviso2017The). This activity may also limit key steps involved in tumor cell dissemination (Belviso2017The). The enzyme's catalytic domain is located in the N-terminal region, with threonine at position 19 being essential for its catalytic activities (Belviso2017The).
