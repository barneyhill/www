# CYS1

## Overview
The CYS1 gene encodes the protein cystin 1, which is primarily associated with the primary cilia of renal ductal epithelial cells. Cystin 1 is a cilium-associated protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubule assembly within the ciliary axoneme, thereby contributing to the proper functioning of primary cilia. These cilia are essential for transmitting mechano- and chemosensory signals that regulate various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, such as a myristoylation site and a polybasic stretch motif, which are important for its localization and function within cellular structures. Mutations in the CYS1 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), highlighting its significance in maintaining renal architecture and function (Yang2021Cystin; Fliegauf2003Identification).

## Structure
The CYS1 gene encodes the cystin protein, which is 158 amino acids long and contains 12.7% proline, indicating a hydrophilic nature (Fliegauf2003Identification). The protein includes several conserved domains, such as a predicted N-terminal myristoylation site and a polybasic stretch motif, which are important for membrane anchoring and are conserved between humans and mice (Fliegauf2003Identification). These motifs suggest functional importance in the protein's role within cellular structures.

Cystin is associated with the primary cilia, particularly localizing to the basal bodies and the ciliary axoneme, where it is involved in stabilizing microtubule assembly (Yang2021Cystin). The protein also contains a myristoylation site, a polybasic region, and an AxEGG motif, which are required for targeting cystin to the cilium (Yang2021Cystin). These structural features are crucial for its function in ciliary processes.

The CYS1 protein does not share predictable motifs in its middle and C-terminal parts, which are unique to cystin (Fliegauf2003Identification). The protein's structure and localization suggest a role in maintaining normal renal architecture and function, particularly in relation to ciliary function.

## Function
The CYS1 gene encodes the protein cystin, which is primarily expressed in the primary apical cilia of renal ductal epithelial cells. In healthy cells, cystin plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the Myc proto-oncogene by interacting with the tumor suppressor protein necdin. This interaction forms a regulatory complex that modulates Myc expression, which is essential for maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing the overexpression of Myc, a condition associated with renal cystic diseases (Yang2021Cystin).

Cystin is a cilium-associated protein that localizes to the basal bodies and the ciliary axoneme, where it stabilizes microtubule assembly within the ciliary axoneme. This stabilization is vital for the function of primary cilia in the collecting duct epithelium, which are involved in transmitting mechano- and chemosensory stimuli to signaling pathways. These pathways regulate cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, tissue homeostasis, and cell polarity (Yang2021Cystin).

The expression pattern of CYS1 is strongest in the kidney, with the protein thought to be involved in the structure and function of cilia, particularly in stabilizing microtubule assembly within the ciliary axoneme (Fliegauf2003Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYS1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), a condition characterized by the formation of cysts in the kidneys and, in some cases, liver fibrosis. In a study involving a 5-year-old male with ARPKD, a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.318+5G>A) in the CYS1 gene was identified, which was predicted to have a deleterious effect on splicing. This mutation was absent from the gnomAD database, indicating its rarity (Yang2021Cystin; Yang2020Cystin). The patient exhibited renal-hepatic syndromic features, including polyuria, polydipsia, poor growth, and progression to end-stage kidney disease by age 11 (Yang2021Cystin).

The pathogenesis of ARPKD due to CYS1 mutations is linked to the overexpression of the Myc proto-oncogene, which is thought to be driven by the disruption of the cystin-necdin interaction. This interaction is crucial for regulating Myc expression, and its dysregulation contributes to cyst formation in the kidneys (Wu2013The; Yang2020Cystin). The identification of CYS1 mutations in both human patients and mouse models underscores the gene's critical role in the disease (Yang2021Cystin).

## Interactions
Cystin 1 (CYS1) interacts with the protein necdin to form a regulatory complex that modulates the expression of the Myc gene. This interaction is significant in the context of renal cystic diseases, as Myc overexpression is a hallmark of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (Wu2013The). Cystin lacks a DNA binding domain but can bind to the Myc P1 promoter through its interaction with necdin, which is a DNA-binding protein known to bind to the GN box of the Myc P1 promoter (Wu2013The). Necdin enhances Myc promoter activity, while cystin antagonizes this effect, suggesting a dynamic regulatory role (Wu2013The).

The interaction between cystin and necdin has been confirmed through various methods, including yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Wu2013The). Cystin contains two nuclear localization signals, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it co-localizes with necdin, especially when nuclear export is inhibited (Wu2013The). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Myc expression and may influence other pathways, such as p53 signaling and histone acetylation, through necdin's interactions with multiple transcription factors (Wu2013The).
