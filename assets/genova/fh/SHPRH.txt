# SHPRH

## Overview
The SHPRH gene encodes the SNF2 histone linker PHD RING helicase, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. As a member of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, the protein is characterized by its ATPase activity and its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is involved in the polyubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a critical process for error-free lesion bypass during DNA replication, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Motegi2008Polyubiquitination; Unk2006Human). SHPRH's enzymatic activities are essential for post-replication repair and the prevention of mutations, underscoring its role in cellular homeostasis and protection against carcinogenesis (Motegi2006Human; Brühl2019The). The gene is also implicated in tumor suppression, with mutations and alterations linked to various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Nagelberg2024Integrative; Zhang2018A).

## Structure
The SHPRH protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. It contains a SNF2_N-terminal domain, a linker Histone (H1/H5)-like fold, a PHD zinc finger, a RING finger, and a helicase_C-terminal domain. These domains suggest its involvement in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes (Brühl2019The). The SNF2 domain is associated with ATPase activity, which is stimulated by nucleosomes, although SHPRH does not exhibit conventional nucleosome remodeling activity (Brühl2019The).

SHPRH also functions as a nucleosome-E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacting with various E2-conjugating enzymes to ubiquitinate histones, particularly H3 and H4, in the presence of nucleosomes (Brühl2019The). This ubiquitination activity is crucial for DNA repair and proteasomal degradation pathways (Brühl2019The). The protein's enzymatic functions are primarily studied in the context of PCNA ubiquitination, and it acts as a nucleosome E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of functioning with multiple E2-conjugating enzymes (Brühl2019The).

SHPRH is also linked to cancer, as it is located in a chromosomal region associated with tumor suppressor functions and is involved in the degradation of β-catenin, a coactivator of oncogenic genes (Brühl2019The).

## Function
The SHPRH gene encodes a protein that functions as a ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. SHPRH is involved in the polyubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a process essential for error-free lesion bypass during DNA replication. This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by promoting post-replication repair (PRR) and preventing mutations (Motegi2008Polyubiquitination; Unk2006Human).

SHPRH operates in conjunction with the Mms2-Ubc13 complex to facilitate the polyubiquitylation of PCNA, which is necessary for the error-free template switching (TS) pathway. This pathway helps bypass DNA lesions without introducing errors, thereby reducing reliance on the error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway (Motegi2008Polyubiquitination; Unk2006Human). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various E2-conjugating enzymes to mediate histone and nucleosome ubiquitination, further contributing to DNA repair and chromatin remodeling (Brühl2019The).

SHPRH's function as a nucleosome-stimulated ATPase and E3 ubiquitin ligase underscores its role in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing chromosomal abnormalities, which is vital for cellular homeostasis and protection against carcinogenesis (Motegi2006Human; Brühl2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHPRH gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. SHPRH is identified as a tumor suppressor gene in various cancers, including glioblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer. In glioblastoma, the circular RNA form of SHPRH, known as circ-SHPRH, encodes a protein, SHPRH-146aa, which is down-regulated in tumor cells. This down-regulation is associated with increased tumorigenicity, suggesting a protective role against tumor progression (Zhang2018A).

In LUAD, SHPRH mutations and reduced expression are linked to poorer survival outcomes. The gene is often subject to copy number loss, contributing to tumor development. Re-expression of SHPRH in LUAD cell lines with inactivating mutations reduces tumorigenic potential, highlighting its role in DNA damage response and tumor suppression (Nagelberg2024Integrative).

SHPRH also plays a role in DNA repair pathways, and its inactivation can lead to genomic instability. This instability is a hallmark of various cancers, including melanoma and ovarian cancer, where SHPRH mutations and loss of heterozygosity have been observed (Motegi2008Polyubiquitination; Miller2022Rad5).

## Interactions
SHPRH interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. It physically interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through an APIM motif, which is essential for its nuclear localization and function in DNA damage tolerance (Seelinger2020HelicaseLike). SHPRH also forms complexes with the Rad6-Rad18 and Mms2-Ubc13 enzyme complexes, facilitating the polyubiquitylation of PCNA, which is critical for error-free lesion bypass during DNA replication (Unk2006Human).

SHPRH interacts with histones H3 and H4, catalyzing their ubiquitination in conjunction with certain E2 enzymes, such as the UBE2D and UBE2E families (Brühl2019The). It also binds to the nucleosome acidic patch, interacting with the H2A-H2B dimer in a unique conformation, distinct from other chromatin remodelers (James2024In).

In the context of the cell cycle, SHPRH interacts with MLH1 during the S phase, particularly under conditions of DNA damage, suggesting a role in DNA repair processes (Miller2022Rad5). These interactions highlight SHPRH's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability.
