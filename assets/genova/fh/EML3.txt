# EML3

## Overview
EML3, or Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein-Like 3, is a gene that encodes the microtubule-associated protein EMAP-like 3. This protein is a member of the EML protein family, which is characterized by its role in microtubule regulation and dynamics. EML3 is involved in critical cellular processes such as the organization of the mitotic spindle and the attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores during cell division, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Fry2016EML). The protein contains a C-terminal WD domain that forms beta-propeller structures, essential for its microtubule binding and regulatory functions (Fry2016EML). EML3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and kidney, and its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly by the mitotic NEK6 kinase, which influences its affinity for microtubules (Fry2016EML).

## Structure
EML3 is a member of the EML protein family, which are microtubule-associated proteins characterized by their ability to bind to microtubules. EML3, like EML1, 2, and 4, has a similar structure with an N-terminal region that is largely unstructured except for a short coiled-coil, and a C-terminal domain consisting of multiple WD (tryptophan-aspartate) repeats (Fry2016EML). The N-terminal region includes a trimerization domain (TD) that forms a trimeric coiled-coil structure, essential for the self-association of EML proteins. This domain is characterized by an amphipathic α-helix with conserved hydrophobic residues, such as leucine and valine, that pack into the core of the trimer (Richards2015Microtubule).

The C-terminal WD domain of EML proteins forms beta-propeller domains, with EML1's structure showing a tandem atypical propeller (TAPE) domain (Fry2016EML). EML3 can form both homotrimers and heterotrimers, although it has the most divergent TD among EML proteins, affecting its ability to self-associate and interact with other EML family members (Richards2015Microtubule). EML3 is expressed in the brain, liver, and kidney, and its microtubule binding is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly in the N-terminal basic regions (Fry2016EML).

## Function
EML3 (EMAP like 3) is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in microtubule regulation and dynamics within cells. It is involved in the organization of the mitotic spindle and the proper attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores during metaphase, which is crucial for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Fry2016EML). EML3 colocalizes with the mitotic spindle and midbody microtubules in proliferating cells, such as HeLa cells, indicating its active role during mitosis (Fry2016EML).

The protein contains a C-terminal WD domain that forms beta-propeller structures, essential for its function in microtubule binding and regulation (Fry2016EML). EML3 is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system, liver, and kidney, and associates with the microtubule lattice in cultured cells (Fry2016EML). The N-terminal region of EML3 contains a coiled-coil domain that promotes trimerization, which is important for its microtubule binding capability (Fry2016EML).

Phosphorylation, particularly by the mitotic NEK6 kinase, regulates the affinity of EML3 for microtubules, suggesting a role in the dynamic changes of microtubules during the cell cycle (Fry2016EML). This regulation is crucial for the proper functioning of microtubules in cell division and other cellular processes.

## Interactions
EML3 (EMAP-like protein 3) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics. EML3 has a conserved N-terminal trimerization domain that facilitates its self-association, allowing it to form homotrimers. This domain also enables EML3 to weakly interact with EML2, but not with EML1, indicating selective interaction capabilities within the EML protein family (Richards2015Microtubule).

EML3 is identified as a microtubule-associated protein that interacts with the NIMA-related kinase Nek6. This interaction suggests a role for EML3 in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during mitosis, as it was specifically identified with the Nek6 bait in proteomic studies (Ewing2007Large‐scale). The interaction with Nek6 may involve phosphorylation events that modulate EML3's affinity for microtubules, as phosphorylation by mitotic kinases like NEK6 is known to reduce microtubule binding affinity in related proteins (Fry2016EML).

In Arabidopsis, EML3, a homolog of EML1/2, was co-purified with GTE4, indicating potential interactions in the context of histone modification recognition. This suggests that EML3 might participate in complexes that co-recognize histone modifications, although specific interactions in humans are not detailed (Qian2024Corecognition).
