# GAB4

## Overview
GAB4 is a gene located on chromosome 22q11.1 that encodes a member of the Gab family of scaffolding proteins, specifically known as GRB2-associated binding protein family member 4. This protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways by facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules. Unlike other members of the Gab family, GAB4 lacks the typical Grb2 binding site but contains a conserved p85 binding site, which may influence its functional interactions within the cell. The expression of GAB4 is notably detected in testicular tissue, suggesting its involvement in processes related to cellular growth, differentiation, and survival. Despite its structural similarities to other Gab proteins, the precise biological functions and pathways involving GAB4 remain to be fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research to understand its role in cellular signaling (Wöhrle2009Function).

## Function
The GAB4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the Gab family of scaffolding proteins, which are integral to cellular signaling pathways. GAB4 is located on chromosome 22q11.1 and shares a 65% similarity with Gab2, another member of the Gab protein family. Although the specific functions of GAB4 in human cells are not fully characterized, it is suggested to have potential binding sites for SHP2, a protein involved in signal transduction pathways. Unlike other Gab proteins, GAB4 lacks the typical Grb2 binding site, which is a hallmark of this protein family, and contains only one conserved p85 binding site, distinguishing it from its paralogues (Wöhrle2009Function).

GAB4 is actively transcribed, with expression detected in testicular tissue, indicating its potential involvement in cellular processes related to growth, differentiation, and survival. The structural features of GAB4 suggest it may participate in similar signaling pathways as other Gab proteins, potentially influencing cell growth and survival. The evolutionary history of Gab proteins indicates an expansion in mammals, with GAB4 representing a unique entry in genomic databases, suggesting a role that is yet to be fully understood (Wöhrle2009Function).
