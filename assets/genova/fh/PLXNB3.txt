# PLXNB3

## Overview
The PLXNB3 gene encodes the protein plexin B3, a member of the plexin family of transmembrane receptors. Plexin B3 is primarily involved in neural development, where it functions as a receptor for semaphorin 5A (Sema5A), facilitating processes such as axon guidance and neurite outgrowth. The protein is characterized by a sema domain, which is essential for its homophilic interactions and its role in neuronal morphogenesis. Plexin B3 also interacts with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, Met, indicating its involvement in various cellular signaling pathways, including those related to cell adhesion and migration. The expression of PLXNB3 is observed in multiple brain cell types, and its dysregulation has been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Hartwig2005Plexin; Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3).

## Structure
Plexin B3 (PLXNB3) is a protein encoded by the PLXNB3 gene, consisting of 1,909 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 207 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.21 (Hartwig2005Plexin). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing, resulting in bands of approximately 260 kDa and 140 kDa, indicating a mature, fully glycosylated form resistant to EndoH treatment (Hartwig2005Plexin). Plexin B3 contains ten potential N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that can influence protein folding and stability (Hartwig2005Plexin).

The sema domain of Plexin B3 is crucial for its homophilic interactions and is necessary and sufficient for these interactions, which are important for its role in neurite outgrowth (Hartwig2005Plexin). The sema domain is characterized by a 7-blade β-propeller structure, a common feature in plexins and semaphorins (Hota2012Plexin).

Alternative splicing of the PLXNB3 gene results in at least three isoforms, including a full-length isoform and two variants with deletions in exon 27, leading to different expression patterns across tissues (Hartwig2005Plexin). These isoforms may have distinct functional roles and localization within the cell.

## Function
Plexin B3 (PLXNB3) is a receptor for semaphorin 5A (Sema5A), playing a crucial role in neural development and cellular signaling. In healthy human cells, plexin B3 is involved in axon guidance and neurite outgrowth, processes essential for proper neuronal development and function. It mediates high-affinity binding to Sema5A, which can lead to cellular responses such as axon guidance and growth cone collapse (Hartwig2005Plexin; Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3).

Plexin B3 also interacts with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, Met, forming a complex that can trigger intracellular signaling pathways. This interaction suggests a role in cellular processes like invasive growth and integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3). Additionally, plexin B3 promotes neurite outgrowth through homophilic interactions and its association with the neuron-specific GTPase Rin, indicating its involvement in semaphorin-independent signaling pathways that influence neuronal morphogenesis (Hartwig2005Plexin).

The protein is expressed in various brain cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and is located at the cell surface, where it participates in cell adhesion and signaling processes critical for neural development (Hartwig2005Plexin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLXNB3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, increased expression of PLXNB3 is associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive tumor behavior across various cancer types, including breast cancer. It is linked to worse survival outcomes and is often upregulated in aggressive subtypes and metastatic tumors, suggesting its role as a tumor promoter (Zhang2020Characterization). 

In the context of neurological disorders, PLXNB3 has been studied for its potential role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research suggests that plexin-B3+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells may contribute to AD pathology by secreting amyloid-beta, challenging the traditional view that neurons are the primary source of this peptide. This indicates a possible involvement of PLXNB3 in amyloid plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangle development, which are hallmarks of AD (NihonmatsuKikuchi2021Essential).

Additionally, genetic variations in PLXNB3 have been linked to cognitive performance and brain morphology. Specific haplotypes of the gene are associated with higher verbal intelligence and increased brain white matter volume, suggesting a role in cognitive functions and potential implications in conditions like schizophrenia (Rujescu2006Plexin).

## Interactions
Plexin B3 (PLXNB3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It specifically binds to Semaphorin 5A (Sema5A), a transmembrane semaphorin, which activates Met signaling, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular responses such as invasive growth (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3). This interaction is crucial for the migration of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the presence of sensory neurons, as Plexin B3 mediates sensory nerve-driven tumor cell migration (Le2022Sensory).

PLXNB3 also engages in homophilic interactions, which are interactions between identical molecules, promoting neurite outgrowth and cell adhesion. These interactions are mediated by the sema domain of PLXNB3 and are essential for its role in neuronal development (Hartwig2005Plexin). Additionally, PLXNB3 interacts with Rin, a neuron-specific GTPase, suggesting a role in semaphorin-independent signaling mechanisms that influence neuronal morphogenesis (Hartwig2005Plexin).

The interaction between PLXNB3 and Sema5A does not require neuropilins, which are often involved in semaphorin signaling, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of PLXNB3 in cellular processes related to growth, differentiation, and migration.
