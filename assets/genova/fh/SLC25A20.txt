# SLC25A20

## Overview
The SLC25A20 gene encodes the mitochondrial protein known as solute carrier family 25 member 20 (CAC), which is a transmembrane transporter integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in the carnitine shuttle system, facilitating the exchange of acylcarnitines and free carnitine across the mitochondrial membrane, a process essential for the β-oxidation of fatty acids. The CAC is characterized by its six transmembrane alpha-helices and operates in an antiport mode, undergoing significant conformational changes to transport substrates. It is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with higher expression in energy-demanding organs such as the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. The proper function of the CAC is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and preventing metabolic disturbances, and its dysfunction is associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Indiveri2011The; Palmieri2004The).

## Structure
The SLC25A20 gene encodes the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), a protein integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Structurally, the CAC is characterized by six transmembrane alpha-helices, which form a water-filled cavity open towards the cytosol and closed towards the mitochondrial matrix by a network of interacting charged residues (Indiveri2011The). These helices are arranged in three intramembrane domains that rotate to facilitate the transport reaction, operating in an antiport mode (Tonazzi2021The).

The protein features conserved motifs such as PX[DE]XX and [DE]XX[KR], which form salt bridge networks stabilizing the transporter in different states (Pasquadibisceglie2023In). Key residues involved in substrate binding and translocation include Lys-35, Trp-224, Asp-179, Arg-275, and His-29, which interact with carnitine and acylcarnitines (Tonazzi2021The; Pasquadibisceglie2023In). The hydrophobic pocket formed by Val-25, Pro-78, Val-82, Met-84, and Cys-89 is crucial for binding the hydrophobic chains of acylcarnitines (Tonazzi2021The).

The CAC's structural dynamics involve significant conformational changes, particularly in the H6-H1-H2 helices, during the transition from the c-state to the m-state (Pasquadibisceglie2023In). These structural features are essential for the protein's function in fatty acid metabolism.

## Function
The SLC25A20 gene encodes the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), a mitochondrial transport protein essential for the β-oxidation of fatty acids. This protein facilitates the transport of acylcarnitines across the inner mitochondrial membrane in exchange for free carnitine, a process crucial for the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondrial matrix (Indiveri2011The; Palmieri2004The). The CAC is part of the carnitine shuttle system, which includes carnitine acyl transferases, and is vital for energy production, especially during fasting and physical exercise (Indiveri2011The; Palmieri2004The).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A20 is expressed in all tissues, with particularly high levels in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, where it supports high energy demands (Indiveri2011The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The transport process is electroneutral and involves the exchange of cytosolic acylcarnitine for mitochondrial carnitine, allowing fatty acids to enter the β-oxidation pathway (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Pasquadibisceglie2023In). This function is critical for maintaining energy homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of long-chain fatty acids and acyl-carnitines, which could lead to metabolic disturbances (Palmieri2020Diseases). The proper functioning of SLC25A20 is essential for normal metabolic processes, including the prevention of hypoglycemia and maintenance of normal liver and cardiac function (Palmieri2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A20 gene, which encodes the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), lead to carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition disrupts mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, crucial for energy production, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The deficiency manifests in two clinical forms: a severe neonatal-onset form and a milder infancy-onset form. Symptoms include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, liver dysfunction, and respiratory distress (Wang2011Expanded; Li2022One; Palmieri2020Diseases).

The disorder is characterized by elevated long-chain acylcarnitine levels in the plasma, leading to metabolic crises and, if untreated, high morbidity and mortality, especially in infancy (Wang2011Expanded; Korman2006A). Molecular analysis of the SLC25A20 gene has identified numerous mutations, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations, which result in reduced or abolished CACT activity (Palmieri2020Diseases; Korman2006A). Early diagnosis and management, including dietary modifications and supplementation, are crucial for improving patient outcomes (Palmieri2013The; Chinen2020A).

## Interactions
The SLC25A20 gene encodes the mitochondrial carnitine acyl-carnitine carrier (CAC), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein forms a supramolecular complex with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT-2) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the transport of acyl-carnitines in exchange for carnitine, a process essential for the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway (Tonazzi2021The). 

The CAC is sensitive to redox changes and interacts with thiol-reactive compounds through its cysteine residues, Cys136 and Cys155. These residues act as a molecular sensor, modulating the protein's activity based on their oxidation state. When oxidized, the CAC becomes inactive, but its function is restored when reduced (Tonazzi2021The). 

The CAC also interacts with various drugs and compounds, which can affect its function. For instance, β-lactam antibiotics are competitive inhibitors of CAC, potentially impairing fatty acid β-oxidation. Omeprazole interacts with CAC by forming disulfide bonds with specific cysteine residues, leading to transporter inactivation (Tonazzi2021The). 

Additionally, the mycotoxin patulin inhibits CAC activity by interacting with Cys136, highlighting the potential health implications of such interactions (Giangregorio2023The).
