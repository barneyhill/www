# CLEC20A

## Overview
CLEC20A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 20A, which is part of the C-type lectin family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner, playing crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell-cell adhesion, immune response, and pathogen recognition. The CLEC20A protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction across the cell membrane. Although the specific functions and interactions of CLEC20A are not fully elucidated, its classification within the C-type lectin family implies potential roles in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and potential therapeutic applications of targeting CLEC20A in disease contexts.
