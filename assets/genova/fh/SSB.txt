# SSB

## Overview
The SSB gene encodes the small RNA binding exonuclease protection factor La, a phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and is involved in the stabilization and processing of various small RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III, such as 5S RNA, tRNA, 7S RNA, and hY RNAs. The La protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including the La motif and RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate its binding to RNA substrates. The protein's ability to bind RNA is modulated by its structural features, including a nuclear localization signal and a regulatory phosphorylation site. The La protein's function is further diversified by alternative splicing, which can result in different isoforms with potential implications in autoimmunity and other clinical conditions (Routsias2010Bcell).

## Structure
The La protein, encoded by the SSB gene, is a phosphoprotein involved in RNA metabolism. It binds a variety of small RNAs, including 5S RNA, tRNA, 7S RNA, and hY RNAs, all transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: the La motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and an unusual RRM. The La motif, located in the N-terminal region, folds into a winged-helix motif with three helices. The central RRM consists of a four-strand beta-sheet attached to two alpha-helices, while the C-terminal domain forms a five-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet surface terminated by a long alpha helix (Routsias2010Bcell).

The La protein also contains a long, flexible polypeptide with a short basic motif (SBM), a regulatory phosphorylation site on Ser366, and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Both the La motif and the central RRM are essential for high-affinity poly-U RNA binding, while the C-terminal RRM and SBM contribute to interactions with non-poly-U RNA targets (Routsias2010Bcell). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to the formation of neoepitopes (Routsias2010Bcell).
