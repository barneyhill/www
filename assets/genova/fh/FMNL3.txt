# FMNL3

## Overview
FMNL3, or formin-like 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Diaphanous-related formin family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The FMNL3 protein is characterized by its involvement in actin filament assembly, influencing cellular processes such as shape, movement, and division. It contains key functional domains, including the formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains, which are essential for actin polymerization. FMNL3 is regulated by Rho GTPases and is particularly active at the cell membrane, contributing to the formation of actin networks and membrane protrusions like lamellipodia and filopodia. These structures are crucial for cell migration and morphological changes. Additionally, FMNL3 is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in regulating Golgi architecture and anterograde transport, which are vital for maintaining cellular function and structure (MORIYA2012Protein; Bai2011Identification; Kage2017FMNL2).

## Structure
FMNL3, a member of the formin family, is involved in actin filament assembly and cellular morphological changes. It contains a conserved C-terminal formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, which mediates actin polymerization, and an FH1 domain that binds profilin-bound actin monomers (MORIYA2012Protein). FMNL3 is part of the Diaphanous-related formins (Drfs) and features N-terminal Diaphanous inhibitory (DID) and C-terminal Diaphanous autoregulatory domains (DAD), which maintain the protein in an inactive state until activated by small GTPases like Cdc42 (Kage2017FMNL2).

FMNL3 undergoes N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification essential for its membrane localization and function. This modification is crucial for inducing cellular morphological changes and is required for the protein's association with the Golgi apparatus (MORIYA2012Protein; Kage2017FMNL2). The protein is also a RhoC-specific target, playing a role in cancer cell invasion (MORIYA2012Protein).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FMNL3 are not provided, the protein's functional domains and post-translational modifications are critical for its role in actin dynamics and cellular processes (MORIYA2012Protein; Kage2017FMNL2).

## Function
FMNL3 (formin-like 3) is a member of the Diaphanous-related formin family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. It plays a critical role in actin polymerization, influencing cell shape, movement, and division. FMNL3 is regulated by Rho GTPases and is particularly active at the cell membrane, where it contributes to the formation of actin networks and membrane protrusions, such as lamellipodia and filopodia, which are essential for cell migration and morphological changes (MORIYA2012Protein; Bai2011Identification).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal organization, FMNL3 is involved in intracellular trafficking processes. It regulates Golgi architecture and anterograde transport, functioning downstream of the small GTPase Cdc42. FMNL3's activity at the Golgi apparatus is crucial for maintaining its structure and facilitating the transport of proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. This function is linked to its ability to form actin filaments, which are necessary for the mechanical processes involved in vesicle trafficking (Kage2017FMNL2).

FMNL3's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and structure, impacting processes such as cell migration, invasion, and intracellular transport (Bai2011Identification; Kage2017FMNL2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in FMNL3 expression or its interactions have been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer. The methylation of BCAR3 at lysine 334 by SMYD2 methyltransferase enhances the interaction between BCAR3 and FMNL3, promoting cell migration and invasiveness, which are critical steps in cancer metastasis. This interaction is crucial for the pro-migratory phenotype of cancer cells, suggesting that disruptions in FMNL3 interactions could be associated with cancer metastasis (Casanova2023Cytoskeleton).

FMNL3, along with FMNL2, is also involved in regulating Golgi architecture and anterograde transport, processes that are essential for maintaining cellular function. Disruption of FMNL3 through RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas9 leads to Golgi fragmentation and defective vesicle trafficking, which can affect cellular transport processes (Kage2017FMNL2). Although the direct link between FMNL3 mutations and specific diseases is not extensively documented, its role in actin dynamics and cellular transport suggests that dysregulation may contribute to pathological conditions, including cancer and potentially cardiovascular diseases (Kage2017FMNL2).
