# TEKT5

## Overview
TEKT5 is a gene that encodes the protein tektin 5, which is a member of the tektin family of filament-forming proteins. Tektin 5 plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, particularly within sperm cells, where it is essential for motility and fertility. The protein is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in the processes of spermatogenesis and the formation of sperm flagella. It contributes to the stability and elasticity of axonemal microtubules, which are crucial for the proper function of these cellular structures (Aoki2019Comprehensive; Hanafusa2012Serological). Beyond its role in reproductive biology, TEKT5 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its aberrant expression is associated with various malignancies, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Hanafusa2012Serological).

## Function
TEKT5 (tektin 5) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, particularly in sperm cells. It is part of the tektin family, which consists of filament-forming proteins that contribute to the stability and elasticity of axonemal microtubules, essential for motility. In healthy human cells, TEKT5 is primarily expressed in the testis, where it is involved in spermatogenesis and the proper formation of sperm flagella, influencing sperm motility and fertility (Hanafusa2012Serological).

TEKT5 is implicated in maintaining the stability of microtubules, which are critical for the structural integrity of cilia and flagella. This function is essential for the motility of sperm, as the protein localizes in the mitochondrial sheath of the sperm tail midpiece, contributing to the proper arrangement and function of the axonemal structure (Aoki2019Comprehensive). The protein's role in stabilizing tubulin is also linked to its involvement in cell cycle regulation, as it affects the expression of genes like Hdac6, which is involved in tubulin acetylation (Aoki2019Comprehensive). These molecular processes underscore TEKT5's importance in reproductive biology and its potential implications in fertility.

## Clinical Significance
TEKT5 (tektin 5) is implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression. It is identified as a cancer/testis antigen, with upregulated expression in several malignancies, including colon, gastric, liver, lung, and prostate cancers. In some colon cancer cases, TEKT5 expression levels are comparable to those in the testis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in cancer (Hanafusa2012Serological). The gene's expression is associated with somatic mutational burden, particularly in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, linked to a bivalent promoter site near its 5' end (Calabrese2017Assessing).

TEKT5 also plays a role in cancer cell cycle regulation. Knockdown of TEKT5 in ovarian cancer cells results in G1 phase arrest and increased apoptosis, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression and survival (Aoki2019Comprehensive). This effect is mediated through the tubulin-SMAD axis, where TEKT5 influences the stability of tubulin and the expression of cell cycle regulators like p27 kip1 (Aoki2019Comprehensive).

In testicular germ cells, TEKT5 is crucial for spermatogenesis. Knockdown in mice leads to abnormal spermatogenesis and reduced acetylated Î±-tubulin levels, affecting sperm morphology and motility (Aoki2019Comprehensive; Geng2024Tektin).

## Interactions
TEKT5, a member of the tektin protein family, is involved in various interactions that contribute to its role in cellular structures such as cilia and flagella. In the context of cancer cells, TEKT5 is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle through its influence on the tubulin-SMAD axis. TEKT5 knockdown leads to increased nuclear localization of SMAD3, a signaling molecule that enhances the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1, thereby affecting cell cycle progression (Aoki2019Comprehensive).

In sperm flagella, TEKT5 is part of the microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) network, where it interacts with other tektins and proteins. TEKT5 is found in several conformations and interacts with proteins such as TEKT3-1 and TEKT2-2, as well as FAM166C and PPP1R32, which are associated with the tubulin lattice (Leung2022Unraveling). These interactions are crucial for the structural organization and stability of sperm flagella, contributing to their motility and function. TEKT5's presence in multiple copies and its unique conformations suggest its significant role in the architecture of sperm doublet microtubules (Leung2022Unraveling).
