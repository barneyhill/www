# OR13C5

## Overview
The OR13C5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 5, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. Characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, OR13C5 shares structural similarities with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Salas2017Whole). Beyond its traditional role in olfaction, OR13C5 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including respiratory infections and immune regulation, suggesting its expression in non-olfactory tissues (Salas2017Whole). The gene's involvement in diverse clinical contexts, such as glioblastoma responsiveness and cognitive disorders, highlights its potential significance in human health and disease (Dehghani2021A; Morelli2024Exploring).

## Function
The OR13C5 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules. These receptors are characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, similar to many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, and are responsible for initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell (Salas2017Whole). OR13C5 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering signal transduction pathways that contribute to olfactory sensation.

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR13C5 may have functions beyond odor perception. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, where genetic variations in OR13C5 are associated with increased susceptibility (Salas2017Whole). The receptor is also suggested to be involved in modulating physiological processes in human airways and may express in non-olfactory tissues, such as pulmonary macrophages, potentially regulating immune functions (Salas2017Whole). These findings indicate that OR13C5 may play a role in broader physiological and pathological processes beyond its traditional sensory functions.

## Clinical Significance
The OR13C5 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts. In glioblastoma research, mutations in OR13C5 have been observed in a significant proportion of tumors responsive to Regorafenib treatment, suggesting a potential role in tumor responsiveness. Specifically, a consistent multinucleotide variation affecting Threonine in codon 81 (Thr81) was found in 91% of responsive glioblastoma cases, compared to only 20% in non-responsive cases, indicating a possible link between OR13C5 mutations and treatment efficacy (Morelli2024Exploring).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, a heterozygous deletion overlapping OR13C5 was detected in a patient with mild cognitive impairment, and similar deletions have been reported in Alzheimer's disease cases. This suggests that copy number variations involving OR13C5 may be associated with cognitive disorders, although these findings require further validation (Dehghani2021A).

Additionally, OR13C5 has been associated with von Willebrand factor plasma levels in genome-wide association studies, which are relevant to cardiovascular diseases. However, the specific clinical implications of these associations remain to be fully elucidated (SabaterLleal2019GenomeWide). Overall, while OR13C5 is linked to various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
