# CGN

## Overview
The CGN gene encodes cingulin, a scaffolding protein primarily associated with the cytoplasmic surface of epithelial and endothelial tight junctions (TJs). Cingulin plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of these junctions by linking the submembrane plaque domain to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating the transduction of mechanical forces and influencing TJ assembly and function (Cordenonsi1999Cingulin). As a phosphoprotein, cingulin interacts with various proteins, including ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and myosin, and modulates the activity of RhoGTPases, which is crucial for endothelial barrier integrity (Schossleitner2016Evidence). The CGN gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in several diseases, notably cancers, where alterations can lead to increased tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy (Huang2024Tight). Through its interactions and regulatory functions, cingulin is integral to cell signaling pathways that contribute to tissue integrity and barrier function.

## Structure
Cingulin (CGN) is a scaffolding protein that forms a parallel homodimer, with each subunit consisting of distinct structural domains: a globular 'head' domain, a coiled-coil 'rod' domain, and a small globular 'tail' domain (Rouaud2020Scaffolding; Guillemot2012Cingulin). The head domain contains a conserved ZO-1-Interaction-Motif (ZIM) within its N-terminal fragment, which is crucial for binding to the ZU5 domain of ZO-1, promoting ZO-1 unfolding and recruitment to tight junctions (Vasileva2020Cingulin). This interaction is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) of 40.4 nM (Vasileva2020Cingulin).

The coiled-coil 'rod' domain facilitates dimerization and interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), such as GEF-H1 and p114RhoGEF (Rouaud2020Scaffolding). Phosphorylation by AMPK kinase is a notable post-translational modification that stimulates the opening of the rod domain, enhancing its binding capabilities (Rouaud2020Scaffolding). Cingulin's structure allows it to interact with actin and myosin, linking membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and regulating junction architecture (Guillemot2012Cingulin).

## Function
Cingulin (CGN) is a phosphoprotein localized at the cytoplasmic surface of epithelial and endothelial tight junctions (TJs), playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of these junctions. It is involved in linking the submembrane plaque domain to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the barrier, gate, and fence functions in epithelial tissues (Cordenonsi1999Cingulin). Cingulin interacts with several proteins, including ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, myosin, and AF-6, facilitating the transduction of mechanical forces from the cytoskeleton to TJ proteins, thereby influencing TJ assembly, structure, and function (Cordenonsi1999Cingulin).

In endothelial cells, cingulin regulates barrier function by modulating junctional RhoGTPases activity through binding to guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins. This regulation is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and reducing vascular permeability (Schossleitner2016Evidence). Cingulin also influences the mechanical properties of epithelial cells by maintaining apical surface stiffness and regulating tension at the apicolateral junctional membrane, which is vital for cell shape and tension (Vasileva2020Cingulin). Through these interactions and functions, cingulin plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways, contributing to tissue integrity and barrier function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CGN gene, which encodes the tight junction protein cingulin, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. The CGN c.3560C > T variant is associated with increased cancer susceptibility and is identified as a putative germline cancer risk variant. This mutation is linked to oxaliplatin resistance and enhanced tumor metastasis, particularly in colorectal and endometrial cancers (Huang2024Tight). The variant promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for tumor progression, by altering actin arrangement and promoting cell invasion and migration. It leads to the downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, as well as the transcription factor Twist (Huang2024Tight).

The CGN c.3560C > T variant also results in the overexpression of IQGAP1, a scaffold protein with oncogenic potential, and activates Rac1, a GTPase involved in cell migration and invasion. This activation is associated with cancer cell proliferation and migration in various cancers, including melanoma, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers (Huang2024Tight). Targeting Rac1 with inhibitors like NSC23766 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to suppress tumor growth in cells with the CGN mutation (Huang2024Tight).

## Interactions
Cingulin (CGN) is a cytoplasmic protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial and endothelial cells. It interacts with several proteins associated with TJs, including ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and myosin. The interaction with ZO-1 is particularly strong, with a dissociation constant of 5 nM, indicating a significant physiological relevance (Cordenonsi1999Cingulin). Cingulin binds to the ZU5 domain of ZO-1 through its N-terminal fragment containing the ZO-1-Interaction-Motif (ZIM), which is crucial for the interaction and the unfolding of ZO-1, promoting its assembly at TJs (Vasileva2020Cingulin).

Cingulin also interacts with the RhoA exchange factor GEF-H1, inhibiting Rho signaling and affecting the G1/S phase transition in cell cycles. This interaction is mediated by the PH domain of GEF-H1 binding to the rod domain of cingulin (Aijaz2005Binding). Additionally, cingulin binds directly to polymerized microtubules through its head region, mediated by electrostatic interactions with the acidic patches on the C-terminal tails of tubulin subunits (Mangan2016Cingulin). These interactions highlight cingulin's role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of epithelial cells.
