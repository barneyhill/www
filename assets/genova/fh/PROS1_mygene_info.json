protease, activated protein C (APC) to inhibit blood coagulation. It is found in plasma in both a free, functionally active form and also in an inactive form complexed with C4b-binding protein. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant hereditary thrombophilia. An inactive pseudogene of this locus is located at an adjacent region on chromosome 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar processing to generate mature protein.
