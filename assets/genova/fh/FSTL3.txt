# FSTL3

## Overview
FSTL3, or follistatin-like 3, is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein belonging to the follistatin-like protein family. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with and modulate members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, such as activin and myostatin, thereby influencing a wide range of physiological processes. Follistatin-like 3 is involved in critical functions including glucose and fat metabolism, reproductive development, and cardiovascular health. It is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, where it plays roles in tumor progression, immune evasion, and cardiac hypertrophy. The protein's structure, which includes two follistatin domains, allows it to bind and neutralize specific ligands, thus modulating their biological activity (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Tian2022Roles; Mukherjee2007FSTL3).

## Structure
Follistatin-like protein 3 (FSTL3) is a member of the follistatin-like protein family, characterized by its monomeric glycosylated form. The protein consists of 263 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 27.6 kDa. It is encoded by five exons, each contributing to distinct functional regions: a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain (ND), two repeating 10-cysteine follistatin domains (FSD1 and FSD2), and an acidic L-amino acid-containing C-terminal domain (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Tian2022Roles).

FSTL3 shares structural similarities with the SPARC family of proteins, typically featuring an N-terminal domain and two follistatin domains. These domains often include a heparin-binding site located in FSD1, promoting binding to extracellular proteoglycans (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). Unlike follistatin, FSTL3 lacks a third follistatin domain and a basic heparin-binding sequence, which prevents it from binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, allowing it to circulate freely (Cash2009The).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, contributing to its stability and function. FSTL3 can form dimers, which are important for its quaternary structure and biological activity (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike).

## Function
Follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3) is a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes by interacting with members of the TGF-β superfamily, such as activin and myostatin. It acts primarily as an antagonist to these ligands, modulating their activity and influencing several cellular and organismal functions (Tian2022Roles; Mukherjee2007FSTL3).

In healthy human cells, FSTL3 is involved in glucose and fat homeostasis. It regulates the activity of activin and myostatin, which are crucial for maintaining normal adult physiology. FSTL3-null mice exhibit increased pancreatic β-cell mass, reduced visceral fat, and improved glucose tolerance, indicating its role in glucose regulation and fat metabolism (Tian2022Roles; Mukherjee2007FSTL3).

FSTL3 also plays a role in reproductive development, particularly in the differentiation of estrogen-producing granulosa cells during folliculogenesis. It is involved in the invasion and migration of trophoblasts, essential for successful embryonic implantation (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Xu2020Follistatinlike).

In the cardiovascular system, FSTL3 is activated in heart failure and is associated with myocardial hypertrophy, where it inhibits the antihypertrophic effects of activin-A (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike). It is also involved in bone formation and strengthening by binding to ADAM12 and reducing osteoclast differentiation (Tian2022Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Follistatin-like protein 3 (FSTL3) is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In cardiovascular diseases, FSTL3 is associated with cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Knockout studies in mice have shown reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for heart failure (Tian2022Roles). In metabolic disorders, FSTL3 deletion in mice leads to increased pancreatic β cell mass, reduced visceral fat, and improved glucose tolerance, indicating its role in glucose and fat homeostasis (Mukherjee2007FSTL3).

In cancer, FSTL3 is overexpressed in various tumors and is linked to poor prognosis. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Tian2022Roles). In colorectal cancer, FSTL3 is associated with immune evasion and resistance to anti-PD1 therapy by stabilizing c-Myc, which increases PDL1 and IDO1 expression (Li2024FSTL3). In hepatocellular carcinoma, FSTL3 is linked to tumor fibrosis and immune modulation, affecting the response to immunotherapy (Li2023Stromaassociated). These findings highlight FSTL3's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
FSTL3 (follistatin-like 3) is known for its interactions with various proteins, primarily inhibiting members of the TGF-β superfamily, such as activins and myostatin. FSTL3 directly binds to activin A and myostatin, neutralizing their activity and influencing processes like muscle growth and metabolism (Parfenova2021FollistatinLike; Mukherjee2007FSTL3). In colorectal cancer (CRC), FSTL3 interacts with the c-Myc protein, a proto-oncogene and transcription factor. This interaction enhances c-Myc stability by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby promoting immune evasion in CRC cells (Li2024FSTL3). FSTL3 binds to a specific fragment of c-Myc (354-406aa), while c-Myc binds to a fragment of FSTL3 (99-119aa) (Li2024FSTL3).

FSTL3 also interacts with fibronectin-1 (FN1) and integrin α5β1 in CRC, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression. This interaction is crucial for cytoskeletal remodeling and enhancing the invasive capacity of CRC cells (Liu2021Bioinformatic). These interactions highlight FSTL3's role in modulating various signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression and immune evasion.
