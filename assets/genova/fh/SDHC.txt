# SDHC

## Overview
The SDHC gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain as part of Complex II. This protein is essential for anchoring the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone, a critical step in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Moosavi2019The; Bayley2005The). The SDHC protein is characterized by its transmembrane helices and involvement in electron transfer processes, which include interactions with heme groups and iron-sulfur clusters (SATOH2014Alternative). Mutations in the SDHC gene can lead to various pathologies, including hereditary tumor syndromes such as paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, due to their impact on the protein's structure and function (Bayley2005The; Bayley2006Mutation).

## Structure
The SDHC gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is a crucial component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as Complex II, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein anchors the SDH complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane and contains a ubiquinone binding site (Bayley2005The). The SDHC protein is composed of 169 amino acids and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1q21, which consists of six exons (Brière2005Succinate; SATOH2014Alternative).

The SDHC protein structure includes transmembrane helices that facilitate its role in anchoring the SDH complex. It is involved in electron transfer processes, likely containing heme groups and iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for its function in the electron transport chain (SATOH2014Alternative). Alternative splicing variants of SDHC, such as the Δ5 isoform, result from a frameshift mutation due to the loss of exon 5, leading to the loss of the heme binding region and abolishing enzyme activity (SATOH2014Alternative).

Mutations in SDHC can lead to various pathologies, including paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, due to their impact on the protein's structure and function (Bayley2005The).

## Function
The SDHC gene encodes a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, which is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. SDHC, along with SDHD, forms the hydrophobic anchor of the SDH complex, securing it to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This anchoring is crucial for the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone, a key step in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Moosavi2019The; Moreno2020Succinate).

In healthy human cells, SDHC is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including the adrenal gland, brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. It plays a critical role in maintaining normal SDH activity and mitochondrial function, which is essential for cellular energy metabolism (SATOH2014Alternative). The SDH complex, including SDHC, also helps regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are important for cellular signaling and homeostasis (Moreno2020Succinate).

SDHC's role extends beyond energy production; it is involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis and oxidative stress response, which are crucial for maintaining cellular health and function (Moosavi2019Genetic). Its proper function is vital for the stability and activity of the SDH complex, impacting overall mitochondrial integrity and cellular metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHC gene are associated with several hereditary tumor syndromes, particularly paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. These tumors are linked to the sympathetic nervous system and can be catecholamine-secreting. SDHC mutations are implicated in a small percentage of sporadic head and neck paraganglioma cases, with a specific mutation, c.214C>T, resulting in the substitution of arginine for cysteine, affecting a highly conserved protein motif involved in the succinate-ubiquinone reductase complex (Bayley2006Mutation). 

SDHC mutations are also associated with Carney-Stratakis syndrome, characterized by the presence of both gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and paragangliomas. In this syndrome, mutations such as c.43C>T and IVS5+1G>A have been identified, leading to significant decreases in succinate dehydrogenase activity and contributing to tumor development (Pasini2007Clinical). 

The clinical presentation of SDHC mutation carriers includes both benign and malignant head and neck paragangliomas, as well as extra-adrenal paragangliomas. The tumor risks for SDHC mutation carriers are similar to those with paternally inherited SDHD mutations, necessitating similar tumor screening protocols (Andrews2018Tumour).

## Interactions
SDHC, a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It interacts with other subunits of the SDH complex, including SDHA, SDHB, and SDHD, to facilitate electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone (Kovářová2014High). SDHC is part of the hydrophobic membrane anchor of the SDH complex, which is crucial for its function in linking the tricarboxylic acid cycle with the respiratory chain (Kovářová2014High).

In the context of mitochondrial function, SDHC is involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes, including supercomplexes or megacomplexes, which are cell-type-specific (Sabbir2021CAMKK2). The regulation of SDHC expression and its integration into these complexes can be influenced by pathways involving AMPKα, PGC1α, and NRF1/2, as well as CAMK1/4 and CREB signaling (Sabbir2021CAMKK2).

Mutations in SDHC can affect its interactions and sensitivity to succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs), as seen in studies on Botrytis cinerea, where specific mutations in the SDHC subunit alter the enzyme's affinity for different SDHIs (Amiri2020Mutations). These mutations are located in the quinone binding pocket, impacting the SDH complex's structure and function (Amiri2020Mutations).
