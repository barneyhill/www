# FAXDC2

## Overview
FAXDC2, or fatty acid hydroxylase domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. The protein encoded by FAXDC2 functions as a C4-methyl sterol oxidase, playing a critical role in the oxidative removal of methyl groups from sterol intermediates, which is essential for the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. This enzyme is categorized as a hydroxylase and is a paralog of MSMO1, indicating its involvement in the demethylation processes within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. FAXDC2 is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences lipid synthesis and modification, impacting cell membrane composition and signaling pathways. The expression of FAXDC2 is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling, linking it to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) recycling and MAPK pathway activation, thereby connecting cholesterol biosynthesis to broader cellular signaling mechanisms (Madan2024The).

## Function
FAXDC2, or fatty acid hydroxylase domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, FAXDC2 functions as a C4-methyl sterol oxidase, primarily in the Kandutsch-Russell branch of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the oxidative removal of methyl groups at the C4 position of sterol intermediates, a crucial step in converting lanosterol to cholesterol (Madan2024The). This enzyme is a paralog of MSMO1 and is involved in the demethylation of cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates, such as lophenol and dihydro-T-MAS, which are part of the Kandutsch-Russell pathway (Madan2024The).

FAXDC2 is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across various species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Madan2024The). It is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the synthesis and modification of lipids, impacting cell membrane composition and signaling pathways (Madan2024The). The expression of FAXDC2 is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling, where it is typically repressed. Inhibition of Wnt signaling leads to increased expression of FAXDC2, which enhances receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) recycling and MAPK pathway activation, linking cholesterol biosynthesis to cellular signaling pathways (Madan2024The).

## Clinical Significance
The FAXDC2 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FAXDC2 expression is significantly downregulated, and this reduction is associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of FAXDC2 in liver cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell viability, induce S phase arrest, and reduce cell invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Peng2023FAXDC2). 

In colorectal cancer, FAXDC2 is repressed by high Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is prevalent in over 80% of cases. This repression leads to the accumulation of C4-methyl sterols, such as lophenol and dihydro-T-MAS, which are associated with cancer pathology (Madan2024The). The gene's repression in Wnt-high cancers suggests its involvement in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and its potential impact on cancer progression (Madan2024The).

FAXDC2 also plays a role in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. Its knockout prevents Wnt inhibition-induced RTK activation, affecting proteins like EGFR and ERBB2, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and differentiation (Madan2024The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FAXDC2 in cancer biology.

## Interactions
FAXDC2 is involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and has been shown to colocalize with NSDHL in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), suggesting a potential physical interaction or close functional relationship within the demethylase complex (Madan2024The). This colocalization is consistent with FAXDC2 being a functional paralog of MSMO1, which also cooperates with NSDHL and other enzymes critical for the demethylation of cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates (Madan2024The). 

While the context does not provide specific details on direct physical interactions of FAXDC2 with other proteins or nucleic acids, it highlights the enzyme's role in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. FAXDC2 is necessary for the recycling and activation of RTKs such as EGFR and ERBB2, which are crucial for MAPK signaling upon Wnt inhibition (Madan2024The). The enzyme's activity influences the abundance of C4-methyl sterols, which are important for RTK signaling, indicating an indirect regulatory interaction with these pathways (Madan2024The). However, specific physical interactions with proteins or nucleic acids remain unreported in the provided context.
