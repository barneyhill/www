# NLGN1

## Overview
NLGN1 is a gene that encodes the protein neuroligin 1, a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule integral to synapse formation and function in the nervous system. Neuroligin 1 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is part of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold superfamily, sharing structural similarities with acetylcholinesterase but lacking enzymatic activity (Fabrichny2007Structural). The protein plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity by interacting with presynaptic neurexins to facilitate synaptic connectivity, particularly at excitatory synapses (Wu2019Neuroligin1). It is involved in regulating synaptic strength and plasticity, influencing processes such as long-term potentiation and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function (Chanda2017Unique). Mutations in the NLGN1 gene have been associated with neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, underscoring its significance in neurodevelopment and synaptic organization (Nakanishi2017Functional).

## Structure
Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion protein that plays a crucial role in synapse formation and function. The primary structure of NLGN1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which includes a single N-terminal extracellular domain, a type I transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail with several binding motifs (Bourne2014The). The secondary structure of NLGN1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming part of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold superfamily, which is similar to acetylcholinesterase but lacks a catalytic site (Fabrichny2007Structural).

The tertiary structure of NLGN1 is characterized by a globular shape with specific domains, including an esterase-like domain. The NLGN1 ectodomain has been structurally characterized, showing a high similarity to acetylcholinesterase, including a dimeric assembly through a four-helix bundle (Bourne2014The). NLGN1 primarily exists as dimers or higher-order oligomers, a feature crucial for its function, as dimerization is necessary for its synaptogenic effects (Bemben2015The).

Post-translational modifications of NLGN1 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which influence its synaptic functions. Phosphorylation by CaMKII at residue T739 is crucial for its surface expression and ability to stimulate synaptogenesis (Bemben2015The). Splice variants of NLGN1 can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties, affecting its binding properties and synaptic localization (Bourne2014The).

## Function
Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and function in the nervous system. It interacts with presynaptic neurexins to facilitate synaptic connectivity and communication, particularly at excitatory synapses (Chanda2017Unique; Wu2019Neuroligin1). NLGN1 is involved in the regulation of synaptic strength and plasticity, influencing processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function. The extracellular domain of NLGN1 is sufficient to rescue LTP loss in cells lacking neuroligins, while the intracellular domain is essential for basal NMDAR-mediated transmission (Wu2019Neuroligin1).

NLGN1 also plays a role in presynaptic maturation by promoting the formation of mature presynaptic boutons and enhancing synaptic vesicle pool size and exocytosis rates (Wittenmayer2009Postsynaptic). Phosphorylation of NLGN1 by CaMKII enhances its surface expression and ability to stimulate synaptogenesis, indicating its involvement in synapse formation and modification in response to synaptic activity (Bemben2015The). NLGN1's interactions with synaptic scaffolding molecules and its role in receptor trafficking further underscore its importance in synaptic organization and function (Bemben2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NLGN1 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Rare variants of NLGN1, such as P89L, L269P, G288E, and H786Y, have been associated with ASD, affecting synaptic function by impairing dendritic spine formation and reducing protein expression levels (Nakanishi2017Functional). The P89L variant, in particular, has been linked to abnormal social behavior and impaired spatial memory in mice, traits relevant to ASD (Trobiani2020The; Nakanishi2017Functional).

NLGN1 deletion in mice results in impaired spatial memory and increased repetitive behaviors, which are considered relevant to autism. These behavioral abnormalities are associated with a reduced NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio at corticostriatal synapses, suggesting that altered NMDA receptor function may underlie these symptoms (Blundell2010Neuroligin1). The repetitive grooming behavior observed in NLGN1 knockout mice can be mitigated by D-cycloserine, indicating a potential therapeutic approach (Blundell2010Neuroligin1).

In humans, a partial deletion of NLGN1 has been linked to severe neurological phenotypes, including microcephaly, seizure disorders, and intellectual disability, highlighting the gene's role in synaptic maturation and neurological function (Millson2011Chromosomal).

## Interactions
Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule that participates in several critical protein interactions essential for synaptic function. NLGN1 forms a trans-synaptic complex with presynaptic neurexins, specifically binding to both α- and β-neurexins. This interaction is regulated by alternative splicing at specific sites, with splice site B in NLGN1 being a key determinant for α-neurexin binding (Boucard2005A). The binding of NLGN1 to neurexin 1β is calcium-dependent, requiring the presence of Ca2+ for the interaction to occur (Nguyen1997Binding).

NLGN1 also interacts with the scaffolding protein PSD-95, which is crucial for its synaptic localization and function. This interaction is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation at the S839 site of NLGN1, affecting its binding to PSD-95 and consequently its synaptic expression (Jeong2019PSD95). Additionally, NLGN1 associates with the GluN1 subunit of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, playing a significant role in the synaptic incorporation and retention of these receptors, which is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Budreck2012Neuroligin1). These interactions highlight NLGN1's role as a key organizer in synaptic connectivity and function.
