# LONRF3

## Overview
LONRF3 is a gene that encodes the protein LON peptidase N-terminal domain and ring finger 3, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a LON peptidase N-terminal domain, which suggests a role in proteolytic activities, and a ring finger domain, typically associated with protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. LONRF3 is implicated in the regulation of protein quality control and cellular stress responses, although its precise biological functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential involvement in various physiological and pathological conditions.
