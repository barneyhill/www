# OR8D2

## Overview
The OR8D2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily D member 2, a protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Foster2014Extrasensory). Characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, OR8D2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and other tissues, such as the human tongue, suggesting potential roles beyond traditional olfactory functions (Foster2014Extrasensory). The gene is located on chromosome 11q25 and shares a high degree of identity with its mouse ortholog, indicating evolutionary conservation (Gaudin2006Mouse). Additionally, OR8D2 has been implicated in various cellular processes through its involvement in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, with emerging evidence suggesting a role in the progression of myocardial infarction (Fang2020Risk).

## Structure
The OR8D2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Foster2014Extrasensory). The primary structure of OR8D2 consists of amino acid sequences that form the protein, while the secondary structure includes alpha helices that span the cell membrane, contributing to the receptor's functional conformation (Gaudin2006Mouse).

The tertiary structure of OR8D2 involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor capable of interacting with odorant molecules. Although the quaternary structure is generally not applicable to olfactory receptors, as they typically function as monomers, the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. These modifications can influence receptor function and localization within the cell membrane (Foster2014Extrasensory).

OR8D2 is expressed in various tissues, including the human tongue, where it may play a role in detecting chemical stimuli beyond traditional olfactory settings (Foster2014Extrasensory). The gene is located on chromosome 11q25 and belongs to family 8, with a high degree of identity to its mouse ortholog MOR171.8 (Gaudin2006Mouse).

## Function
OR8D2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR8D2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Foster2014Extrasensory).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR8D2 has been identified in various tissues outside the traditional sensory organs, such as the tongue, where it is detected using RT-PCR (Foster2014Extrasensory). This suggests that OR8D2 may have additional functions beyond olfactory perception. The gene is also part of a subfamily of olfactory receptor genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Fang2020Risk).

In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), OR8D2 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene, indicating its potential involvement in the progression of MI through GPCR signaling pathways (Fang2020Risk). However, the specific function of OR8D2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.
