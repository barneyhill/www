# OR11H1

## Overview
The OR11H1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily H member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is crucial for their role in detecting odorant molecules and initiating olfactory signal transduction. The OR11H1 protein functions as a monomer and undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its stability and functional activity. Alterations in the expression of OR11H1 have been associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, indicating its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation; GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Structure
The OR11H1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. This structural feature allows the receptor to traverse the cell membrane seven times, forming a complex topology essential for its function in odorant signal transduction.

Post-translational modifications of the OR11H1 protein may include glycosylation and phosphorylation. These modifications are common in GPCRs and play crucial roles in the protein's stability, localization, and function. Glycosylation typically involves the addition of carbohydrate groups, which can affect protein folding and receptor activity. Phosphorylation, on the other hand, involves the addition of phosphate groups, which can regulate receptor activity and interactions with other proteins.

The OR11H1 protein does not have documented quaternary structure information, as it functions as a monomeric receptor. The primary structure of the protein, which is the sequence of amino acids, dictates the formation of its secondary and tertiary structures, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the available context. The protein's ability to bind odorant molecules and initiate signal transduction is largely dependent on its structural conformation and post-translational modifications.

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR11H1 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In Parkinson's Disease (PD), OR11H1 is significantly downregulated in the frontal cortex during both premotor and parkinsonian stages, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). This downregulation is consistent across both sexes and is observed in the total population analyzed (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), OR11H1 expression is upregulated in the entorhinal cortex during advanced stages, indicating a possible involvement in the disease's progression (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). Conversely, in Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), OR11H1 is downregulated in the frontal cortex across different subtypes, suggesting a distinct pattern of dysregulation compared to AD (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).

These findings highlight the potential significance of OR11H1 expression changes in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, although the exact mechanisms and implications of these alterations remain to be fully elucidated. The gene's dysregulation in these conditions suggests it may play a role in the nonmotor symptoms and altered cortical functions associated with these diseases (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).
