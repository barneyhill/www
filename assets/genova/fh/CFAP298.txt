# CFAP298

## Overview
CFAP298 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 298, which is integral to the function and stability of motile cilia and flagella. The protein is categorized as a dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF) and plays a pivotal role in the preassembly and stabilization of axonemal dyneins, essential motor proteins for ciliary movement (Wang2022FBB18; Aprea2021Defects). CFAP298 interacts with various components of the HSP90 co-chaperone R2TP complex and other dynein axonemal assembly factors to facilitate the proper folding and stabilization of dynein heavy chains (Wang2022FBB18). Mutations in CFAP298 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and other conditions resulting from impaired ciliary motility, highlighting its critical role in cellular processes such as motility and sensory perception (MarieHardy2021The; Legendre2021Motile).

## Function
CFAP298, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 298, plays a crucial role in the preassembly and stabilization of axonemal dyneins, which are essential motor proteins for ciliary movement. In healthy human cells, CFAP298 is involved in the cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein arms, which are critical for the motility of cilia and flagella (Wang2022FBB18; Aprea2021Defects). This protein functions as a dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF), interacting with other preassembly factors and components of the HSP90 co-chaperone R2TP complex to facilitate the folding and stabilization of dynein heavy chains (Wang2022FBB18). CFAP298 is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, contributing to their stability and function (Wang2022FBB18).

Mutations in CFAP298 can lead to defects in ciliary motility, resulting in conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by impaired respiratory function and other systemic issues due to dysfunctional cilia (Legendre2021Motile). The protein's role in maintaining proper ciliary function underscores its importance in cellular processes like motility and sensory perception (MarieHardy2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP298 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in ciliary function. One of the main disorders linked to CFAP298 mutations is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by impaired ciliary motility. This impairment leads to symptoms such as chronic respiratory infections, male infertility, and situs inversus, a condition where the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions (Wang2022FBB18; Tinoco2023Primary). In PCD, mutations in CFAP298 result in the loss of both outer and inner dynein arms, which are crucial for the proper function of motile cilia (Wang2022FBB18).

In zebrafish models, mutations in CFAP298 have been shown to cause spinal deformities similar to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in humans. These mutations disrupt cerebrospinal fluid circulation due to defective cilia motility, leading to scoliosis-like deformities (MarieHardy2021The). The cfap298tm304 zebrafish mutant line exhibits a high prevalence of spinal deformities, particularly in females, which mirrors the human condition of AIS (MarieHardy2021The). These findings suggest a potential link between cilia dysfunction and scoliosis in humans.

## Interactions
CFAP298, also known as FBB18 in Chlamydomonas, is involved in the preassembly of axonemal dyneins, crucial for ciliary function. It physically associates with almost all axonemal dyneins, as mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 14 out of 15 axonemal dyneins were associated with FBB18. This protein also interacts with several dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs), including DNAAF1, DNAAF2, DNAAF3, DNAAF4, DNAAF5, DNAAF6, DNAAF10, DNAAF11, DNAAF16, and DNAAF17. However, it does not associate with DNAAF7, DNAAF9, DNAAF12, DNAAF13, DNAAF14, and DNAAF18 (Wang2022FBB18).

CFAP298 interacts with components of the HSP90 co-chaperone R2TP complex, specifically RuvBL1/2, but not with the holo-R2TP complex, suggesting that RuvBL1/2 may function independently in dynein preassembly (Wang2022FBB18). The protein is also involved in a network of interactions with other proteins such as WDR92, ODA7, and LRRC6, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays (Wang2022FBB18). These interactions are essential for the stability and assembly of dynein complexes, which are critical for ciliary motility.
