# RAB35

## Overview
RAB35 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB35. This protein is integral to intracellular membrane trafficking and is characterized by its role in regulating endocytic recycling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. RAB35 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, neurite outgrowth, and immunological synapse formation. It functions by interacting with multiple effector proteins, such as centaurin-β2 and fascin, and is modulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors. The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its involvement in key signaling pathways and cellular processes (Banworth2017Consequences; Chua2009Rab35; Kouranti2006Rab35).

## Structure
The RAB35 protein is a small GTPase involved in intracellular membrane trafficking, characterized by a conserved globular G-domain structure with α/β-folds. This structure includes five α-helices and six β-sheets, with the α-helices being less thermally stable than the β-sheets (Murata2020The). The protein's secondary structure is sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and salt concentration, with GTP binding increasing the α-helix content and stabilizing the switch-I and switch-II regions, which are crucial for maintaining RAB35 in an active state (Murata2020The).

RAB35 interacts with effector proteins like centaurin-β2, with specific threonine residues in the switch II region being critical for this interaction (Etoh2015StructureFunction). The presence of Mg2+ enhances RAB35's affinity for GTP, promoting thermal stability (Murata2020The). The protein's dynamic structure is influenced by environmental conditions, which may affect its interactions with effector proteins (Murata2020The). The study of RAB35's structure and interactions highlights its potential as a disease biomarker and its role in cellular processes such as neurite outgrowth and cytokinesis (Etoh2015StructureFunction; Murata2020The).

## Function
Rab35 is a small GTPase involved in regulating endocytic recycling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in the terminal steps of cytokinesis, particularly in stabilizing the intercellular bridge and facilitating abscission. Rab35 is localized to the plasma membrane and endocytic compartments, where it controls a fast recycling transport step from endosomes to the plasma membrane, essential for the recycling of transferrin receptors (Kouranti2006Rab35).

Rab35 is also involved in the regulation of phosphoinositides and F-actin, which are critical for its function in endocytic recycling and other cellular processes. It recruits OCRL onto clathrin-coated endosomes, facilitating the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2, and negatively regulates ARF6 activation on recycling endosomes, which is important for correct cargo recycling (Klinkert2016Rab35).

In T cells, Rab35 is essential for receptor recycling and immunological synapse formation, where it facilitates the enrichment of T-cell receptors and other signaling molecules at the synapse through polarized secretion from recycling endosomes (PatinoLopez2008Rab35). Rab35's activity is modulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, such as the connecdenn family, which link its activation to actin cytoskeleton organization (Marat2012Connecdenn).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the RAB35 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, RAB35 is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Activating mutations such as A151T and F161L have been identified in tumors, leading to increased AKT phosphorylation and promoting cancer progression (Guadagno2019Rab; Banworth2017Consequences). RAB35 also interacts with p53-related protein kinase (PRPK), suppressing p53 expression and potentially bypassing apoptosis checkpoints, which can contribute to tumor development (Banworth2017Consequences).

In neurological disorders, RAB35 is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Down syndrome (DS). Elevated RAB35 levels in PD are associated with increased α-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of the disease, suggesting a role in its pathogenesis (Chiu2016Increased; Song2018The). In DS, RAB35 is involved in regulating exosome release, which may help manage endosomal abnormalities and protect neurons (Song2018The).

RAB35 also plays a role in myelination, with its loss leading to hypermyelination and increased mTORC1 signaling, relevant to conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Sawade2020Rab35regulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RAB35 in various diseases.

## Interactions
Rab35, a small GTPase, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with centaurin-β2 (ACAP2) through a GTP-dependent mechanism, specifically involving the ANKR domain of centaurin-β2. This interaction is crucial for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and does not exhibit Rab35-GAP activity (Etoh2015StructureFunction; Kanno2010Comprehensive). Rab35 also forms a tripartite complex with MICAL-L1 and centaurin-β2 during neurite outgrowth, with MICAL-L1 binding to the GTP-bound form of Rab35 (Kobayashi2013Rab35).

Rab35 interacts with fascin, an actin-bundling protein, which is essential for modulating actin dynamics. This interaction is significant for the formation of cell extensions and filopodia (Chua2009Rab35). Rab35 also binds to TRX2, impacting exosome secretion and cell migration in colorectal cancer cells. This interaction occurs at their N-terminal regions and is associated with mitochondrial localization (Zhang2022TRX2Rab35).

Rab35's interaction with EPI64C, a GAP molecule, is involved in T-cell receptor recycling and the formation of the immunological synapse (Chua2009Rab35). These interactions highlight Rab35's role in regulating endocytic recycling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
