# SEC61A2

## Overview
The SEC61A2 gene encodes the SEC61 translocon subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the SEC61 translocon complex, which is integral to the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of a heterotrimeric complex that includes SEC61a, SEC61b, and SEC61g subunits, with SEC61A2 specifically contributing to the SEC61a subunit (Chang2018Circadian). The SEC61 translocon is essential for the proper synthesis, folding, and secretion of proteins, as it facilitates the movement of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen or their integration into the ER membrane (Haßdenteufel2019ER). Beyond its fundamental role in protein translocation, SEC61A2 is involved in the circadian regulation of the secretory pathway, particularly influencing the rhythmic secretion of collagen, which is vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis and collagen matrix assembly (Chang2018Circadian).

## Function
The SEC61A2 gene encodes a subunit of the SEC61 translocon complex, which is essential for the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in eukaryotic cells. This complex is a heterotrimeric structure composed of SEC61a, SEC61b, and SEC61g subunits, with SEC61A2 specifically encoding one of the SEC61a subunits (Chang2018Circadian). The SEC61 translocon plays a critical role in the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen or their integration into the ER membrane, which is vital for protein synthesis, folding, and secretion (Haßdenteufel2019ER).

In the context of collagen synthesis, SEC61A2 is involved in the translocation of collagen mRNAs, such as Col1a1 and Col1a2, to the ER, facilitating the proper assembly of collagen fibers. The absence of the SEC61 translocon results in collagen being translated into the cytosol, disrupting collagen fiber formation and secretion (Chang2018Circadian). Additionally, SEC61A2 is implicated in the circadian regulation of the secretory pathway, influencing the rhythmic secretion of collagen and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Chang2018Circadian). This rhythmic expression is crucial for collagen matrix assembly and degradation, highlighting SEC61A2's role in cellular and organismal homeostasis.
