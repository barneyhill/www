# SPRR2B

## Overview
SPRR2B, or small proline-rich protein 2B, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin. The protein is categorized as a component of the cornified envelope in keratinocytes, which is part of the epidermal differentiation complex. It plays a pivotal role in forming the cornified cell envelope by cross-linking with other proteins, thereby enhancing the resilience of the skin barrier (Tong2006Expression). SPRR2B is expressed in various tissues, including the human corneal epithelium, where its expression is regulated by cell density and age (Tong2006Expression). The gene's expression is also responsive to environmental stressors, such as UVB irradiation, which can influence its role in barrier function and inflammatory responses (Tong2006Expression). Clinically, SPRR2B has been associated with conditions such as atopic eczema and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both dermatological and oncological contexts (Dębińska2022A; Zhang2015Global).

## Function
SPRR2B (small proline-rich protein 2B) is a component of the cornified envelope in keratinocytes, contributing to the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin. It is part of the epidermal differentiation complex and plays a crucial role in forming the cornified cell envelope by cross-linking with other proteins, enhancing the resilience of the skin barrier (Tong2006Expression). In the human corneal epithelium, SPRR2B is expressed and regulated in response to cell density and age, with its mRNA levels being downregulated in overconfluent or older cultured human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) compared to subconfluent cells (Tong2006Expression). This suggests that SPRR2B expression is influenced by the confluence state of cells, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the corneal epithelium (Tong2006Expression).

SPRR2B is also involved in the response to environmental stressors, such as UVB irradiation, which can downregulate its mRNA expression in HCECs (Tong2006Expression). This regulation may have implications for the protein's role in barrier function, inflammatory responses, and wound healing in the ocular surface (Tong2006Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The SPRR2B gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in skin barrier function and its expression in various tissues. Alterations in SPRR2B expression are associated with atopic eczema (AE), a common inflammatory skin condition. The rs6693927[A] allele of SPRR2B is significantly associated with an increased risk of AE, particularly in non-allergic individuals, suggesting that this variant may affect skin barrier function by altering the cornified envelope's physical properties (Dębińska2022A). This association is independent of filaggrin (FLG) mutations, although there is evidence of a compounded risk when both SPRR2B and FLG variants are present (Dębińska2022A).

In addition to its role in skin disorders, SPRR2B expression is altered in certain cancers. It is upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, indicating a potential role in the pathophysiology of this cancer subtype (Zhang2015Global). Similarly, SPRR2B is part of a group of genes upregulated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), suggesting its involvement in cancer progression through pathways like NF-κB (Yan2021Singlecell). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both dermatological and oncological contexts.
