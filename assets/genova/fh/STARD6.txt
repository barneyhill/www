# STARD6

## Overview
STARD6 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR related lipid transfer domain containing 6, which is a member of the START domain protein family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid transport and metabolism, with a significant role in intracellular cholesterol transport and homeostasis. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, facilitating the transfer of cholesterol to mitochondria, a critical step in steroidogenesis that impacts hormone synthesis and cellular signaling pathways. STARD6 is expressed mainly in the testis, particularly in germ cells, and is implicated in processes such as spermatogenesis and mitochondrial function. Additionally, in the brain, STARD6 is involved in the synthesis of neurosteroids, which are crucial for brain function and neuroprotection. The gene has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease, particularly in individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele, highlighting its potential clinical significance in lipid metabolism and neurodegenerative conditions (Yin2019Association; Clark2011The; Soffientini2016Intracellular).

## Function
STARD6 is a member of the START domain protein family, which is involved in lipid transport and metabolism. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in intracellular cholesterol transport and homeostasis. It facilitates the transfer of cholesterol to mitochondria, a critical step in steroidogenesis, impacting hormone synthesis and cellular signaling pathways (Clark2011The; Soffientini2016Intracellular).

STARD6 is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in germ cells, with the highest expression in round spermatids. Its function in spermatogenesis is not fully understood, but it is identified as a putative gene required for mitochondrial NADH-dependent dehydrogenase activity, which is associated with sperm motility and quality (Clark2011The). Recombinant purified STARD6 has been shown to stimulate cholesterol transfer to isolated mitochondria as efficiently as STARD1 and STARD3, indicating a potential mitochondrial function in male germ cells (Clark2011The).

In the brain, STARD6 is involved in the synthesis of neurosteroids, which are important for brain function. It transfers cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane, a crucial step for neurosteroid synthesis (Yin2019Association). The protein's expression in the nervous system suggests a role in neuroprotective steroid formation, particularly under neurotoxic conditions (Clark2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The STARD6 gene has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly in individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele. Research has identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10164112 within the STARD6 gene as significantly associated with an increased risk of AD. This association is particularly pronounced in carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, suggesting a genetic interaction that heightens susceptibility to the disease. The minor T allele of rs10164112 is linked to a higher risk of AD under both additive and dominant genetic models in these individuals (Yin2019Association).

The study highlights the role of lipid metabolism in AD, as STARD6 is involved in lipid transport and metabolism. The findings suggest that while the rs10164112-T allele is not an independent risk factor, it contributes to AD risk when combined with the APOE ε4 allele. This underscores the importance of understanding genetic interactions, particularly those involving lipid metabolism pathways, in the context of AD (Yin2019Association). The research did not find a significant association between AD and the SNP rs7920721 near the ECHDC3 gene, indicating that the primary focus should remain on STARD6 in this context (Yin2019Association).
