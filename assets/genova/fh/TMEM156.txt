# TMEM156

## Overview
TMEM156 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 156, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to infection and cancer. TMEM156 has been identified as interacting with viral proteins in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting a potential role in viral pathogenesis (SalgadoAlbarrán2021Comparative). Additionally, it is part of gene signatures used to predict prognosis in cancers such as breast cancer and glioma, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Guo2021Construction; Zhang2023Illustrating). The gene's expression is also noted in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its involvement in cancer heterogeneity (Ye2023The). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of TMEM156 remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to clarify its role in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM156 has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, glioma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In breast cancer, TMEM156 is part of a 5-gene signature that predicts prognosis, with its expression significantly elevated in tumor tissues, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Guo2021Construction). In glioma, TMEM156 is included in a risk score signature based on transmembrane protein-related genes, which helps predict patient outcomes and is associated with distinct expression profiles and survival outcomes (Zhang2023Illustrating). In PDAC, TMEM156 is expressed in specific cell clusters within the tumor microenvironment, indicating its role in the heterogeneity of TMEM gene expression across different cell types (Ye2023The).

TMEM156 has also been identified as an optimal target gene in multiple myeloma (MM) due to its differential expression and high targetScore values, although specific clinical implications in MM remain unclear (Xue2019Identifying). Additionally, TMEM156 is downregulated in veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency syndrome (VODI), but the clinical significance of this alteration is not well defined (Cliffe2012Clinical). Overall, while TMEM156 is associated with various diseases, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
TMEM156 has been identified as interacting with viral proteins ORF7B and ORF3 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This interaction suggests a role for TMEM156 in the infection process, as it is differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines (SalgadoAlbarrán2021Comparative). In breast cancer research, TMEM156 is part of a 5-gene signature used to predict prognosis, although specific protein interactions within this context are not detailed (Guo2021Construction). In glioma studies, TMEM156 is one of the transmembrane protein-related genes analyzed for its prognostic value, but specific interactions are not provided (Zhang2023Illustrating). Additionally, TMEM156 has been noted in a heatmap of differentially methylated genes in cancer invasiveness studies, indicating its potential involvement in cancer processes, though specific interactions are not detailed (Cheishvili2015A). These findings suggest that TMEM156 may participate in various cellular processes related to infection and cancer, but detailed interaction partners and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
