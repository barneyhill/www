# UST

## Overview
The UST gene encodes the enzyme uronyl 2-sulfotransferase, a sulfotransferase that is integral to the post-translational modification of glycosaminoglycans, particularly dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This enzyme is responsible for the sulfation of specific sugar residues, a process that is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular matrix and connective tissues (Kobayashi1999Molecular; Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological). Uronyl 2-sulfotransferase operates within the Golgi apparatus, where it influences cellular processes such as communication, growth, and repair (Kobayashi1999Molecular). The enzyme's activity is vital for cell migration and adhesion, impacting immune responses and tissue development (Nikolovska2017Melanoma; Wang2018The). Alterations in the UST gene have been linked to various connective tissue disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological; Alazami2016Expanding).

## Function
The UST gene encodes the enzyme uronyl 2-sulfotransferase, which plays a critical role in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, specifically dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the C-2 position of iduronic acid (IdoUA) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues within these polysaccharides, a modification essential for their biological function (Kobayashi1999Molecular; Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological). The sulfation process mediated by UST is crucial for the proper formation and function of dermatan sulfate chains, which are important components of the extracellular matrix and contribute to the structural integrity of connective tissues (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological).

In healthy human cells, UST is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the post-translational modification of glycosaminoglycans, influencing cellular communication, growth, and repair processes (Kobayashi1999Molecular). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in cell migration and adhesion, processes that are vital for immune and inflammatory responses, as well as tissue development and repair (Nikolovska2017Melanoma; Wang2018The). The proper functioning of UST is essential for maintaining the normal biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, which play significant roles in various physiological processes (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UST gene, which encodes the enzyme uronyl 2-sulfotransferase, have been implicated in several connective tissue disorders. A de novo deletion involving the UST gene has been associated with a severe form of cutis laxa, a condition characterized by reduced skin elasticity and joint hyperlaxity (Alazami2016Expanding). This deletion may also lead to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)-like symptoms, which include joint and skin abnormalities (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological).

Altered expression of UST has been observed in osteoarthritis (OA) and Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), where reduced levels of the enzyme may contribute to cartilage damage (Han2017Altered; Lei2019Abnormal). In KBD, a disease affecting cartilage, the abnormal expression of UST and other sulfotransferases is linked to chondrocyte necrosis and cartilage degeneration (Lei2019Abnormal). Selenium deficiency, which affects UST expression, has been suggested as a pathogenic factor for KBD, highlighting the enzyme's role in maintaining cartilage integrity (Wang2018The). These findings suggest that UST plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of various connective tissue and cartilage-related disorders.
