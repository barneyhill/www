# MOCS3

## Overview
MOCS3 is a gene that encodes the molybdenum cofactor synthesis 3 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and tRNA thiolation in human cells. The MOCS3 protein is characterized as a multifunctional enzyme with an E1-like activity, facilitating the transfer of sulfur in critical biochemical pathways. It consists of an N-terminal MoeB-like domain and a C-terminal rhodanese-like domain, which are essential for its function in sulfur transfer processes (Suganuma2022Beyond; Leimkühler2017Shared). MOCS3 is involved in the activation of MOCS2A and URM1 through adenylation, which is crucial for Moco biosynthesis and the formation of 2-thiouridine in tRNA, respectively (Chowdhury2012Dual). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing neurotoxicity, as it supports the function of Moco-dependent enzymes (Tian2021Case).

## Structure
The MOCS3 protein in humans is a two-domain protein consisting of an N-terminal MoeB-like domain and a C-terminal rhodanese-like domain (RLD). The N-terminal MoeB-like domain is homologous to ubiquitin-activating enzymes and is involved in the adenylation of MOCS2A and URM1, facilitating sulfur transfer processes (Suganuma2022Beyond; Leimkühler2017Shared). The C-terminal RLD possesses catalytic sulfur-transfer activity, acting as a sulfur donor for thiocarboxylate formation on MOCS2A (Leimkühler2017Shared). 

MOCS3 is involved in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation, highlighting its multifunctionality (Leimkühler2017Shared). The sulfur required for these processes is sourced from the l-cysteine desulfurase NFS1 in the cytosol, which transfers sulfur via a cysteine on the MOCS3-RLD to MOCS2A (Leimkühler2017Shared). 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Leimkühler2017Shared). The structure and function of MOCS3 are crucial for the sulfur relay system in Moco biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation.

## Function
The MOCS3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and tRNA thiolation in human cells. MOCS3 is an E1-like protein that facilitates the transfer of persulfide sulfur, interacting with URM1 and MOCS2A to activate them through adenylation. This activation is followed by sulfur transfer, forming a thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of these proteins, which is essential for Moco biosynthesis (Chowdhury2012Dual). Moco is necessary for the activity of several enzymes, including xanthine dehydrogenase and sulfite oxidase, which are involved in critical metabolic pathways (Tian2021Case).

MOCS3 also plays a significant role in tRNA thiolation by interacting with URM1, a ubiquitin-like modifier. This interaction is crucial for the formation of 2-thiouridine in tRNA, which is important for accurate genetic code deciphering and tRNA structure stabilization (Suganuma2022Beyond; Chowdhury2012Dual). The protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it forms a heterotetrameric complex necessary for these activation reactions (Chowdhury2012Dual). MOCS3's function is vital for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing neurotoxicity by supporting the function of Moco-dependent enzymes (Tian2021Case).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MOCS3 gene have been identified as a cause of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including neonatal seizures, hypertonia, feeding difficulties, and developmental delay, often leading to early childhood death. The deficiency results from the inactivity of molybdenum-dependent enzymes due to impaired Moco biosynthesis, leading to the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites such as sulfite, which can cause neuronal death (Tian2021Case).

The first confirmed case of Moco deficiency due to MOCS3 mutations involved compound heterozygous variants, c.1375C>T and c.325C>G, in a Chinese infant. This case highlighted the pathogenic role of MOCS3 in Moco deficiency, expanding the genetic basis of the disorder beyond the previously known MOCS1, MOCS2, and GPHN genes (Tian2021Case).

Additionally, a low-frequency non-synonymous SNP in MOCS3 has been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, suggesting that variations in this gene may also influence susceptibility to other conditions, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Jackson2016Exomewide).

## Interactions
MOCS3 is a multifunctional protein involved in various biochemical pathways, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and tRNA thiolation. MOCS3 interacts with MOCS2A, facilitating the adenylation and subsequent sulfur transfer necessary for forming thiocarboxylated MOCS2A, a key step in Moco biosynthesis (Unknownauthors2017Biochemistry; Leimkühler2017Shared). This process involves the l-cysteine desulfurase NFS1, which provides sulfur to MOCS3, highlighting a sulfur relay system essential for Moco biosynthesis (Unknownauthors2017Biochemistry).

In the context of tRNA thiolation, MOCS3 interacts with URM1, a ubiquitin-related modifier protein. MOCS3 activates URM1 in the presence of ATP, forming URM1-AMP, which is then transferred to the persulfide group on MOCS3's rhodanese-like domain (RLD). This interaction is crucial for the sulfur transfer required for the thiolation of cytosolic tRNAs, specifically those for glutamine, glutamic acid, and lysine (Unknownauthors2017Biochemistry; Leimkühler2017Shared). MOCS3's interactions with these proteins underscore its role as a shared-function protein, participating in both Moco biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation (Leimkühler2017Shared).
