# ANKRD36C

## Overview
ANKRD36C is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 36C protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 36C protein may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. Although the precise biological functions of ANKRD36C remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a rare hematological disorder. Research indicates that ANKRD36C may be involved in protein glycosylation pathways, which are crucial for the regulation of interactions between ADAMTS13 and von Willebrand factor, potentially influencing the pathogenesis of iTTP (Basu2020Exome).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD36C has been implicated in immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels, leading to a low platelet count. Exome sequencing studies have identified abnormalities in the ANKRD36C gene in patients with iTTP, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The gene is associated with protein glycosylation pathways, which are significant in iTTP, as these pathways influence the interactions between ADAMTS13 and von Willebrand factor, potentially affecting autoantibody formation (Basu2020Exome).

ANKRD36C has been identified as a hub gene with high centrality measures in epistatic network analyses, indicating its potential role in the genetic interactions underlying iTTP. The study found a statistically significant association between genetic variants in ANKRD36C and clinical features such as ADAMTS13 antibody levels, haptoglobin levels, and creatine, further supporting its contribution to the disease phenotype (Basu2020Exome).

While the exact function of ANKRD36C in iTTP remains largely unknown, its involvement in glycosylation and protein-protein interactions suggests that mutations or alterations in its expression could disrupt normal cellular processes, contributing to the development of iTTP (Basu2020Exome).
