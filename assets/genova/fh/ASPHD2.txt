# ASPHD2

## Overview
The ASPHD2 gene encodes the protein aspartate beta-hydroxylase domain containing 2, which is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily. This protein is characterized by its enzymatic activity, which involves the hydroxylation of aspartate residues, a post-translational modification that can influence protein function and stability. ASPHD2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction pathways. Its role in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway suggests a potential involvement in cellular differentiation and proliferation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise biological functions and interactions of ASPHD2 remains an active area of research, with implications for understanding its role in health and disease.
