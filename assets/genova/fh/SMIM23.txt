# SMIM23

## Overview
SMIM23 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 23, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This gene has garnered attention in both cancer research and animal genetics due to its involvement in critical biological processes. In oncology, SMIM23 is associated with cancer invasion and metastasis, and its expression levels have been utilized in prognostic models to predict patient outcomes (Li2022PanCancer). In the realm of animal genetics, SMIM23 is linked to reproductive traits in cattle, being located in quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions that influence traits such as nonreturn to estrus and scrotal circumference (Buzanskas2017Candidate). Despite these associations, the specific biological functions and disease implications of SMIM23 in humans remain to be fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research.

## Clinical Significance
The SMIM23 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer and reproductive traits. In cancer research, SMIM23 is identified as a gene involved in the processes of invasion and metastasis, which are critical hallmarks of cancer progression. A study developed a risk scoring system using gene expression levels, including SMIM23, to predict cancer patient prognostic outcomes, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis (Li2022PanCancer).

In the field of animal genetics, SMIM23 has been associated with reproductive traits in cattle. It is located within quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions linked to reproductive traits such as the rate of nonreturn to estrus in Swedish Red and Swedish Holstein cattle, and scrotal circumference in American Angus cattle. This suggests a role in reproductive biology, although specific biological processes or diseases related to SMIM23 in humans are not detailed in the literature (Buzanskas2017Candidate).

Despite these associations, there is limited direct evidence linking SMIM23 to specific diseases or conditions in humans. Further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target.
