# EIF3D

## Overview
EIF3D is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (eIF3d), a critical component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the initiation of protein synthesis by facilitating the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNA, thereby aiding in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex. eIF3d is characterized as a noncanonical 5′ cap-binding protein, particularly active under metabolic stress conditions, and is involved in eIF4E-independent translation pathways (Roiuk2024eIF4Eindependent; Hayek2022eIF3). Structurally, eIF3d interacts with various components of the ribosome and the eIF3 complex, contributing to the regulation of translation and impacting cellular growth and proliferation (Brito2020Structure; Simonetti2019Structural). The gene's expression is notably altered in several cancers, where it is often overexpressed, suggesting its potential role in oncogenesis and as a therapeutic target (Latosinska2017Proteomics; Valášek2017Embraced).

## Structure
The eIF3d subunit is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a significant role in translation initiation. Structurally, eIF3d interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit and the octameric core of eIF3. The N-terminal tail of eIF3d (eIF3d-NTT) interacts with the PCI domain of eIF3e, suggesting a role in binding to eIF4F (Brito2020Structure). The eIF3d subunit also displays secondary structure elements, including helix α12 and loops between β-strands, which interact with ribosomal proteins and mRNA (Simonetti2019Structural).

eIF3d is located on the periphery of the eIF3 complex and is attached to the octamer through eIF3e (Herrmannová2019Adapted). It interacts with small ribosomal proteins such as Rps16/uS9, contributing to the structural organization of the eIF3 complex (Herrmannová2019Adapted). The subunit is involved in mRNA recruitment, potentially interacting directly with the mRNA's 5' cap, indicating a role in alternative mRNA recruitment mechanisms (Herrmannová2019Adapted). The eIF3d subunit is also noted for its involvement in species-specific regulation due to conserved residues that interact with the mRNA 5'UTR (Simonetti2019Structural).

## Function
EIF3D is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in human cells. It is involved in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA, facilitating the assembly of the pre-initiation complex. EIF3D is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to the regulation of translation, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Hayek2022eIF3).

In healthy human cells, EIF3D functions as a noncanonical 5′ cap-binding protein, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress. It is part of the eIF3 complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. During metabolic stress, such as glucose deprivation, EIF3D is activated through a reduction in CK2-mediated phosphorylation near its cap-binding pocket. This activation allows EIF3D to control a gene program enriched in factors important for glucose homeostasis, including members of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Lamper2020A).

EIF3D also plays a role in eIF4E-independent translation, particularly under stress conditions where the canonical eIF4E1-dependent pathway is inhibited. It has cap-binding capacity and can bind to mRNAs via its cap-binding pocket, enabling their translation even when eIF4E1 is inactive (Roiuk2024eIF4Eindependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3D gene have been implicated in various cancers. EIF3D is notably overexpressed in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) compared to non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Knockdown of EIF3D in metastatic bladder cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, and to decrease tumor growth in xenograft models, suggesting its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Latosinska2017Proteomics).

EIF3D is also overexpressed in other malignancies, including ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinomas, melanomas, and gliomas. In gliomas, EIF3D overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and survival, and its inhibition can lead to decreased tumor growth and induction of apoptosis (Marina2019Relevance; Valášek2017Embraced).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, EIF3D is up-regulated due to Hepatitis delta virus replication, contributing to tumorigenesis. The overexpression of EIF3D in these various cancers suggests that it may play a significant role in oncogenesis, potentially through its involvement in protein synthesis pathways such as eIF2 and mTOR signaling (Latosinska2017Proteomics; Valášek2017Embraced).

## Interactions
EIF3D, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, plays a crucial role in translation initiation through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. EIF3D is essential for the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) in human cells, interacting specifically with the ribosomal protein Rps16/uS9, which is located on the 40S ribosomal subunit. This interaction is suggested to stabilize the codon-anticodon duplex in the P-site, facilitating translation initiation (Herrmannová2019Adapted).

EIF3D also acts as a bridge between the eIF3 octamer and the 40S subunit, anchoring eIF3 to the ribosome and playing a role in mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC. This recruitment is significantly decreased in cells where EIF3D is knocked down, indicating its importance in the assembly process (Herrmannová2019Adapted).

In addition to its role in the eIF3 complex, EIF3D can bind directly to the 5' cap of mRNAs, particularly under conditions where eIF4E is inhibited. This cap-binding activity is crucial for the translation of certain mRNAs that are resistant to eIF4E inhibition, highlighting EIF3D's role in eIF4E-independent translation (Roiuk2024eIF4Eindependent).
