# GRIN2C

## Overview
The GRIN2C gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2C, which is a component of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor. This receptor plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, memory function, and neural development by facilitating calcium ion flow across the cell membrane, thereby influencing neuronal communication and plasticity (Benke2021Clinical). The GRIN2C subunit is primarily expressed in the brain, with higher levels in the cerebellum, suggesting its involvement in cognitive processes (Enoch2014Expression). Structurally, the protein includes several domains, such as the N-terminal domain, agonist-binding domain, and transmembrane domain, which contribute to its function and interaction within the NMDA receptor complex (Hansen2021Structure). Mutations in GRIN2C have been associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Yu2018Rare).

## Structure
The GRIN2C gene encodes a subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor. The protein structure includes several key domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the agonist-binding domain (ABD), and the transmembrane domain (TMD) (Hansen2021Structure). The NTD forms a bilobate structure that assembles into dimers, with the R1 lobe being highly conserved and the R2 lobe contributing to dimer stability and allosteric modulation (Hansen2021Structure). The TMD consists of three transmembrane helices (M1, M3, and M4) and a reentrant M2 pore loop, which is crucial for ion selectivity and permeability (Hansen2021Structure).

The quaternary structure of NMDA receptors involves the assembly of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits, forming a heterotetrameric complex. In the case of GRIN2C, the subunit can form di-heterotetramers with GluN1 or tri-heterotetramers with other GluN2 subunits, such as GluN2A (Zhang2022Distinct). The N1-N2C di-receptor exhibits a dimer-of-dimer structure with domain swapping features, highlighting its asymmetric nature (Zhang2022Distinct). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions.

## Function
GRIN2C encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor. These receptors are crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory function, as they facilitate calcium ion flow across the cell membrane, influencing neuronal communication and plasticity (Benke2021Clinical). In healthy human cells, GRIN2C is primarily expressed in the brain, with notably higher expression levels in the cerebellum compared to other brain regions (Enoch2014Expression). This expression pattern suggests a role in cognitive processes and neural development.

NMDA receptors, including those containing the GRIN2C subunit, are involved in the regulation of synaptic connectivity and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory (Benke2021Clinical). The GRIN2C subunit contributes to the receptor's electrophysiological properties, affecting how neurons respond to neurotransmitters and modulate synaptic strength. Although the specific function of GRIN2C in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in these fundamental neural processes indicates its importance in maintaining normal brain function and development (Benke2021Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRIN2C gene, which encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. A study by Yu et al. identified a rare frameshift mutation (P132Fs) in GRIN2C in a patient with schizophrenia, suggesting that such loss-of-function mutations may increase susceptibility to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (Yu2018Rare). Although the study did not find statistical significance in their genotyping analysis, possibly due to a limited sample size, it highlights the potential genetic influence of ultra-rare variants on schizophrenia risk (Yu2018Rare).

The GRIN2C gene is located on chromosome 17q25.1 and is part of the GRIN gene family, which encodes various subunits of the NMDA receptor. Dysfunction in these receptors, often due to genetic mutations or alterations in subunit expression, is implicated in several diseases, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (Omer2020NMDA). However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with GRIN2C mutations or expression alterations are not extensively documented, indicating a need for further research to clarify its clinical significance (Benke2021Clinical).
