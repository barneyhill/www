# PEAR1

## Overview
PEAR1, or platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in critical physiological processes such as platelet aggregation and endothelial cell function. The PEAR1 protein plays a pivotal role in the stabilization of platelet aggregates through its interaction with the αIIbβ3 integrin, which is essential for effective blood clotting. It is also involved in the activation of key signaling pathways, including PI3K and Akt, which are crucial for maintaining platelet function and stability. In endothelial cells, PEAR1 influences processes such as cell migration, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis, contributing to vascular homeostasis and cardiovascular health. The gene's expression is linked to megakaryopoiesis, acting as a negative regulator of megakaryocyte progenitor cell proliferation, thereby influencing platelet production. Variations in the PEAR1 gene have been associated with cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Izzi2019Variation; Sun2015A; Fisch2015Genetic; Kauskot2012A).

## Structure


## Function
The PEAR1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in platelet aggregation and endothelial cell function. In platelets, PEAR1 is involved in cell activation and aggregation processes, primarily through its interaction with the αIIbβ3 integrin. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing platelet aggregates, which are essential for blood clotting (Sun2015A; Kauskot2012A). PEAR1 is phosphorylated during platelet aggregation, leading to the activation of the PI3K and Akt signaling pathways, which are important for maintaining platelet function and stability (Kauskot2012A).

In endothelial cells, PEAR1 influences endothelial function by affecting processes such as cell migration, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis. It is involved in the AKT signaling pathway, which is important for nitric oxide production and endothelial function, as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) (Fisch2015Genetic). The gene's expression is also linked to megakaryopoiesis, where it acts as a negative regulator of megakaryocyte progenitor cell proliferation, influencing platelet production (Kauskot2013PEAR1).

Overall, PEAR1's activity in platelets and endothelial cells is crucial for cardiovascular health, impacting processes like blood clotting and vascular homeostasis (Izzi2019Variation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PEAR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. The rs12041331 variant of PEAR1 is associated with endothelial dysfunction and altered platelet function, impacting cardiovascular outcomes. Individuals with the A-allele of this variant exhibit better endothelial function, as indicated by higher flow-mediated dilation, but may also experience increased adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, especially when treated with aspirin (Fisch2015Genetic; Stimpfle2018Variants). 

PEAR1 expression levels, influenced by DNA methylation, also play a role in platelet and leukocyte function. Variations in methylation patterns can affect platelet aggregation and inflammation, potentially contributing to thrombo-inflammatory conditions (Izzi2019Variation). 

The rs2768759 variant is linked to increased platelet aggregation and reduced responsiveness to aspirin, suggesting a role in antiplatelet therapy resistance (HerreraGaleano2008A). Additionally, PEAR1's interaction with SVEP1, an endogenous ligand, influences the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is associated with cardiovascular diseases, highlighting the potential for therapeutic targeting of this interaction (Elenbaas2023SVEP1). 

Overall, PEAR1 genetic variations and expression alterations are critical determinants of cardiovascular risk and therapeutic outcomes.

## Interactions
PEAR1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in platelet activation and aggregation. It interacts with Src family kinases (SFKs), specifically c-Src and Fyn, which are essential for its phosphorylation and subsequent signaling pathways. These interactions facilitate the recruitment of p85 PI3K, leading to Akt activation, which is critical for platelet aggregation (Kauskot2012A).

PEAR1 also interacts with the high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor subunit α (FcεR1α), identified as a ligand through a protein microarray and validated by surface plasmon resonance. This interaction is mediated by the membrane-proximal domains of both proteins and is involved in platelet aggregation and PEAR1 phosphorylation (Sun2015A).

Additionally, SVEP1 has been identified as a physiological ligand for PEAR1, with their interaction activating canonical PEAR1 signaling and mTOR pathways, which are significant for platelet biology and cardiovascular disease (Elenbaas2023SVEP1). These interactions highlight PEAR1's role in complex signaling networks that regulate platelet function and aggregation.
