# ITPR1

## Overview
The ITPR1 gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), a critical receptor in the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling. This receptor is a tetrameric calcium channel protein predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm upon binding with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (Gambardella2020Inositol; Fan2018CryoEM). As a receptor, IP3R1 plays a vital role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, secretion, and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the brain's cerebellum (Hisatsune2017IP3). The receptor's function is modulated by interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its sensitivity and activity (Foskett2007Inositol; Mangla2020Type). Mutations in the ITPR1 gene are linked to several neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like spinocerebellar ataxias and Gillespie syndrome (Paganini2018A; van2007Deletion).

## Structure
The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1) is a tetrameric calcium channel protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The receptor is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal channel domain (CTD) (Lemos2020Inositol; Fan2018CryoEM). The LBD is crucial for binding inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and is formed by two contiguous β-trefoil domains (β-TF1 and β-TF2) (Azumaya2020CryoEM). The CTD is involved in forming the ion-conducting pore, which is lined by transmembrane helices (Fan2018CryoEM).

The receptor's quaternary structure is a tetramer, with each subunit contributing to the overall assembly (Prole2019Structure). The transmembrane domain (TMD) consists of six helices per subunit, forming a right-handed bundle that shapes the ion conduction pathway (Fan2018CryoEM). The cytosolic region includes a Zn2+ finger motif, although its regulatory role is not fully confirmed (Fan2018CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating ITPR1 activity (Mangla2020Type). The receptor's large size and complex structure allow it to interact with various regulatory proteins, influencing its function and distribution within the cell (Prole2019Structure).

## Function
The ITPR1 gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), a crucial component in intracellular calcium signaling. This receptor is predominantly located on the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a calcium release channel. Upon binding with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), IP3R1 facilitates the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the cytoplasm, a process essential for various cellular functions such as muscle contraction, secretion, metabolism, and cell growth (Gambardella2020Inositol; Hisatsune2017IP3).

IP3R1 is particularly abundant in the brain, especially in the cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in regulating calcium release in response to neurotransmitters. This regulation is vital for maintaining proper intracellular calcium concentration patterns, which are critical for physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and muscle contraction (Hisatsune2017IP3). The receptor's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and interaction with various proteins, which can influence its sensitivity to IP3 and calcium release (Foskett2007Inositol).

In healthy cells, IP3R1 helps propagate calcium signals necessary for numerous cellular processes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Gambardella2020Inositol). Dysregulation of ITPR1 can lead to altered calcium homeostasis, impacting various physiological outcomes (Gambardella2020Inositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITPR1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) and Gillespie syndrome. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 15 (SCA15) is linked to deletions in the ITPR1 gene, leading to haploinsufficiency and resulting in adult-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia (van2007Deletion). SCA29, another form of spinocerebellar ataxia, is associated with monoallelic missense mutations in ITPR1, such as P1059L and R36C, which can cause congenital or infantile onset ataxia with motor delay and hypotonia (Gambardella2020Inositol; Romaniello2022Superior).

Gillespie syndrome, characterized by non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, aniridia, and intellectual disability, is linked to loss-of-function mutations in ITPR1, including a novel splice site variant that leads to exon skipping and a truncated protein (Paganini2018A; Romaniello2022Superior). Although ITPR1 mutations are not directly linked to Huntington's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease, the gene is implicated in calcium dysregulation, which contributes to neuronal apoptosis in these conditions (Gambardella2020Inositol). The phenotypic diversity of ITPR1 mutations underscores their clinical significance in diagnosing inherited cerebellar ataxias (Hsiao2017Mutational).

## Interactions
ITPR1, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate calcium signaling. It interacts with ORP4L, a scaffold protein that assembles a complex at the plasma membrane, including CD3ε, Gαq/11, and PLCβ3, to mediate IP3-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release. This interaction enhances Ca2+ release from the ER and is crucial for mitochondrial energetics and cell survival in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Cao2019ORP4L). ORP4L specifically interacts with the C-terminal region of ITPR1, facilitating IP3 binding and subsequent calcium release (Cao2019ORP4L).

ITPR1 also interacts with proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders. In Huntington's disease, mutant huntingtin (Htt) forms a complex with ITPR1, sensitizing it to IP3 and leading to deregulated calcium signaling, which contributes to neuronal apoptosis (Egorova2018Inositol). Additionally, Bcl-xL, a Bcl-2 family member, binds to ITPR1, modulating its gating activity and affecting calcium release from the ER, which is crucial for various neuronal functions (Egorova2018Inositol). These interactions highlight the role of ITPR1 in both cancer cell survival and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.
