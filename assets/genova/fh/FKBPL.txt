# FKBPL

## Overview
FKBPL (FK506 binding protein like) is a gene that encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase like, which is involved in various cellular processes, including steroid receptor signaling and cellular stress responses. The protein is categorized as a peptidylprolyl isomerase and is known for its role as a cochaperone in the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-steroid receptor complexes, facilitating the transport and regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor to the nucleus (McKeen2008A). FKBPL also plays a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity, regulating inflammation, and exhibiting anti-angiogenic properties through its interactions with other proteins, such as CKAP4 and members of the LC3/GABARAP family (Li2024Cytosolic; Annett2021The). Clinically, alterations in the FKBPL gene have been associated with various conditions, including cancer and male infertility, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Sunnotel2010Alterations; McKeen2010FKBPL).

## Function
The FKBPL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of steroid receptor signaling and cellular stress responses. FKBPL is involved in the transportation and regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the nucleus upon hormone binding, acting as a cochaperone in the hsp90-steroid receptor complexes. This process is crucial for efficient GR movement into the nucleus and is disrupted when FKBPL is knocked down (McKeen2008A). FKBPL modulates GR transcriptional activity, with its effects varying depending on the cell type, suggesting a role in stabilizing GR protein levels and preventing degradation (McKeen2008A).

In addition to its role in steroid receptor signaling, FKBPL is involved in maintaining vascular integrity and regulating inflammation through NF-κB signaling. It influences the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and helps maintain vascular integrity in endothelial cells (Annett2021The). FKBPL also exhibits anti-angiogenic properties, inhibiting cell migration and tubule formation, and is involved in regulating endothelial and tumor cell migration through a CD44-dependent mechanism (Valentine2011FKBPL). These functions highlight FKBPL's importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FKBPL gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and male infertility. In breast cancer, high expression of FKBPL is associated with improved survival outcomes and increased sensitivity to endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant. FKBPL overexpression decreases estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) levels, inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing sensitivity to estrogen deprivation, which suggests its potential as a prognostic marker and a determinant of response to endocrine therapy (McKeen2010FKBPL).

In male infertility, particularly azoospermia, mutations in the FKBPL gene have been identified, including splice site mutations and amino acid changes. These mutations may lead to loss of function or altered protein interactions, impacting androgen receptor signaling in the testis. The frequency of these mutations in azoospermic populations suggests a significant role in male reproductive health (Sunnotel2010Alterations).

In lung adenocarcinoma, FKBPL expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High FKBPL expression correlates with prolonged overall survival, although it is not an independent prognostic factor. FKBPL appears to suppress tumor proliferation by delaying the G1/S phase transition, indicating its role in tumor suppression (She2024Expression).

## Interactions
FKBPL interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in steroid receptor signaling and other cellular processes. It is known to interact with components of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complex, including Hsp90 and dynamitin. These interactions are facilitated by FKBPL's peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for binding to Hsp90 and dynamitin (McKeen2008A). FKBPL also interacts with the dynein motor protein, dynamitin, suggesting a role in the transport of steroid receptors to the nucleus (McKeen2008A).

In the context of ER-phagy, FKBPL interacts with CKAP4, a multimeric type II transmembrane protein, to mediate ER turnover. This interaction is essential for stress-induced ER-phagy and involves FKBPL oligomerization (Li2024Cytosolic). FKBPL also binds to members of the LC3/GABARAP family through its LIR motifs, which are important for its role in ER-phagy (Li2024Cytosolic).

Additionally, FKBPL interacts with the Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), inhibiting its kinase activity through the PPI domain, and regulates DLK stability via a ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway (Lee2021FKBPL).
