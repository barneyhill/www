# GALR3

## Overview
The GALR3 gene encodes the galanin receptor 3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a significant role in various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily associated with the Gi/o class of G proteins, leading to the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways that influence neurotransmitter and hormone release (Lang2014Physiology; ŠÍPKOVÁ2017The). Galanin receptor 3 is expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it is involved in regulating functions such as mood, stress response, feeding behavior, and pain perception (Smith1998Cloned; ŠÍPKOVÁ2017The). Additionally, GALR3 has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Freimann2015Galanin). The receptor's interaction with specific ligands and its distinct binding affinity profile further underscore its unique role in physiological and pathological processes (Smith1998Cloned).

## Function
GALR3 (galanin receptor 3) is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily couples with Gi/o-type G proteins, leading to the activation of G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channels and a decrease in adenylate cyclase activity, which reduces cytosolic cAMP levels (Lang2014Physiology; ŠÍPKOVÁ2017The). This receptor is involved in inhibiting neurotransmitter and hormone release, particularly in tissues such as the hypothalamus, pituitary, spinal cord, and pancreas, through the inhibition of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (Smith1998Cloned).

GALR3 is expressed in various regions of the central nervous system, including the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, where it plays a role in regulating neurotransmitter release and potentially influencing feeding behavior, mood, and stress responses (Lang2014Physiology; Smith1998Cloned). It is also implicated in the modulation of GABA transmission in the central amygdala, which is associated with anxiety and alcohol consumption behaviors (Lang2014Physiology). In the peripheral nervous system, GALR3 is involved in processes such as nerve regeneration and nociception, affecting pain perception (ŠÍPKOVÁ2017The). The receptor's activity in the skin includes roles in immune responses and hair growth inhibition (Lang2014Physiology).

## Clinical Significance
The GALR3 gene, encoding the galanin receptor 3, is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Alterations in GALR3 expression or function have been associated with mood disorders, particularly depression. GALR3 is linked to prodepressive effects, suggesting its clinical significance in mood regulation (Freimann2015Galanin). Although specific mutations in the GALR3 gene have not been extensively documented, its role in depression highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

In the context of cancer, GALR3 promoter methylation has been studied as a potential epigenetic biomarker. However, unlike GALR1 and GALR2, GALR3 did not show significant differences in methylation levels between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples and normal tissues, indicating a lesser role in this type of cancer (Kanazawa2019Promoter).

The GALR3 receptor is also involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter systems, including noradrenaline and serotonin, which are crucial in mood disorders (Freimann2015Galanin). Despite the limited information on GALR3's specific mutations or expression alterations, its involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
GALR3 (galanin receptor 3) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins to mediate its physiological effects. It is known to couple with the G_i/G_o class of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are involved in inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, thereby reducing cAMP levels within the cell (Smith1998Cloned; Gopalakrishnan2020An). This interaction is crucial for the receptor's role in modulating neurotransmitter release and other cellular responses.

GALR3 can also activate inward potassium currents when co-expressed with GIRK1 and GIRK4 potassium channel subunits in Xenopus oocytes, indicating a functional coupling that leads to hyperpolarization and inhibition of neurotransmitter release (Smith1998Cloned). This suggests that GALR3's interaction with these potassium channels is significant for its inhibitory signaling pathways.

The receptor's interaction with specific ligands, such as galanin and related peptides, is characterized by a distinct binding affinity profile, which differs from other galanin receptor subtypes (Smith1998Cloned). These interactions are essential for understanding the receptor's role in various physiological processes, including its potential involvement in regulating feeding, neurotransmitter release, and other functions (Smith1998Cloned).
