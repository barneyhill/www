# EBLN2

## Overview
EBLN2, or endogenous Bornavirus-like nucleoprotein 2, is a human gene that encodes a protein derived from ancient viral sequences, specifically from Bornavirus. This gene is part of the EBLN family, which is characterized by its integration into host genomes as a result of viral infections. The EBLN2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with mitochondrial proteins associated with apoptosis, suggesting a regulatory role in cell death pathways. Additionally, EBLN2 is implicated in antiviral defense mechanisms, potentially providing resistance to Bornavirus infections by inhibiting viral replication. The protein's presence across different tissues indicates its involvement in diverse cellular functions, although its precise molecular activities and locations within cells are not yet fully understood (Horie2019Interactions; ogawa2022viral; Blinov2017Viral).

## Function
The human gene EBLN2, or endogenous Bornavirus-like nucleoprotein 2, is derived from ancient viral sequences and is part of the EBLN family. In healthy human cells, the EBLN2 protein is involved in interactions with apoptosis-associated mitochondrial proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 1 (AIFM). These interactions suggest a role in regulating apoptosis, potentially influencing cell viability by modulating the apoptotic pathways (ogawa2022viral).

EBLN2 is also implicated in antiviral defense mechanisms. The integration of Bornavirus genes into host genomes, such as EBLN2, has been associated with the evolution of homologous genes that provide a selective advantage by conferring resistance to Bornavirus infections. This resistance is thought to involve the synthesis of a protein N analog that inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby reducing virus replication (Blinov2017Viral).

The presence of EBLN2 in various tissues indicates its potential involvement in diverse cellular functions, although the specific molecular activities and cellular locations of the EBLN2 protein in healthy human cells require further investigation to be fully understood (Horie2019Interactions).

## Clinical Significance
EBLN2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, EBLN2 is associated with vinblastine resistance. The gene was identified as one of the hub genes correlating with this resistance in LNCaP prostate cancer cell samples, although it did not significantly affect prostate cancer occurrence in some analyses (Chen2022CCNB1). In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma, EBLN2 was identified among the top mutated genes in a Chinese cohort, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Liu2023Insight).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), EBLN2 has been identified as a prognostic factor. Its expression level is significantly associated with patient survival, with a hazard ratio indicating a protective effect (Kuang2021New). Additionally, EBLN2 is involved in chromatin remodeling processes, as it is a binding site for the chromatin remodeler CHD3 in prostate cancer cells, indicating its role in gene regulation (Giles2019Integrated). These findings suggest that EBLN2 may play a role in cancer progression and treatment resistance, although its exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
