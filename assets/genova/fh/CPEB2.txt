# CPEB2

## Overview
CPEB2, or cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation. The CPEB2 protein is characterized as an RNA-binding protein, featuring RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and zinc finger domains that facilitate its interaction with specific mRNA sequences. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the elongation phase of protein synthesis by interacting with the elongation factor eEF2, thereby influencing the translation of key mRNAs such as HIF-1α. CPEB2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression and hormonal signaling, particularly in the context of breast cancer and other malignancies. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its diverse functional roles in different cellular environments (Turimella2014Characterization; Tordjman2019Tumor; Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2).

## Structure
CPEB2 is a protein characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function in mRNA translation regulation (Turimella2014Characterization). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including CPEB2a, CPEB2b, CPEB2c, and others, which may influence its function and localization (Turimella2014Characterization; Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2). These isoforms arise from the alternative splicing of specific exons, such as exon 7, and include regions that encode potential phosphorylation sites, which are indicative of post-translational modifications that can modulate CPEB2 activity (Turimella2014Characterization).

CPEB2's interaction with eEF2, a key factor in translation elongation, highlights its role in translational repression, particularly for HIF-1α RNA (Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2). The protein's structure includes a repression motif located within amino acids 188-364, essential for its interaction with eEF2 (Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2). The presence of splice variants like CPEB2A and CPEB2B, which have distinct roles in cancer metastasis, further underscores the functional diversity imparted by its structural variations (DeLigio2017Splice).

## Function
CPEB2 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2) is a crucial regulator of mRNA translation in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by binding to cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements in mRNA, influencing the elongation phase of protein synthesis. CPEB2 interacts with the elongation factor eEF2, reducing eEF2/ribosome-triggered GTP hydrolysis, which slows down peptide elongation of CPEB2-bound RNA (Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2). This regulation is particularly significant for the translation of HIF-1α RNA, where CPEB2 binding impedes its translation under normoxic conditions, maintaining low levels of HIF-1α protein (Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2).

In human mammary epithelial cells, CPEB2 acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing the translation of oncogenic transcription factors such as TWIST1 and HIF1α, which are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and other cancer-related processes (Tordjman2019Tumor). CPEB2 also regulates the translation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, maintaining its protein levels and ensuring normal cellular functions like cell adhesion and proliferation control (Tordjman2019Tumor).

CPEB2 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in integrating hormonal signaling, particularly in mammary gland development and luminal breast cancer, by regulating mRNAs downstream of steroid hormone signaling (Pascual2020The).

## Clinical Significance
CPEB2 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In glioma, CPEB2 is significantly downregulated, particularly in lower-grade gliomas, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing p21 mRNA, leading to cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis (Zhao2023CPEB2). In contrast, in renal cancer, CPEB2 is upregulated and promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration by forming a negative feedback loop with p53, reducing p53 mRNA stability and translation (Di2021A).

In breast cancer, CPEB2 plays a complex role. In luminal breast cancer, it is critical for tumorigenesis, with high expression linked to worse survival in luminal A tumors (Pascual2020The). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), alternative splicing of CPEB2 results in two isoforms, CPEB2A and CPEB2B, with CPEB2B promoting metastasis and anoikis resistance, while CPEB2A has a suppressive effect (DeLigio2019Serine/Arginine–Rich; DeLigio2017Splice).

In multiple myeloma, CPEB2 is overexpressed, enhancing cell growth and angiogenesis, suggesting its role in disease progression (Zeng2023CPEB2). These findings highlight CPEB2 as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
CPEB2 interacts with p53 mRNA by binding to cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), which decreases the stability and translation of p53 mRNA. This interaction is facilitated by RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a zinc finger (ZF) domain within CPEB2, and has been confirmed through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and in vitro RNA pull-down assays (Di2021A). CPEB2 also interacts with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which is involved in maintaining short poly(A) tails in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in mRNA repression (DuranArqué2022Comparative).

CPEB2 forms part of a complex network of interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It shares components of the CCR4-NOT complex with other CPEB family members and interacts with proteins such as G3BP1, PRKRA, DDX3X, ESRP1, and CAPRIN2, which are implicated in mRNA stability, localization, and translation (DuranArqué2022Comparative). CPEB2 also binds to the mRNA of HIF1α and TWIST1, suppressing their translation under certain conditions, and interacts with the elongation factor eEF2 (Tordjman2019Tumor).
