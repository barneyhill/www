# CHST5

## Overview
CHST5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 5, which is a member of the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, specifically targeting keratan sulfate in the Golgi apparatus. The sulfation process facilitated by carbohydrate sulfotransferase 5 is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of various tissues, particularly in the small intestine and colon, where it modifies mucin-type glycoproteins. The enzyme's activity is essential for the biosynthesis of sulfated glycans, which play significant roles in cell signaling, adhesion, and the organization of the extracellular matrix. The expression and function of CHST5 are conserved across species, and its dysregulation has been linked to pathological conditions, including colonic carcinogenesis (Ocampo2019Reconstruction; Akama2001Human; Yu2018Distinct).

## Function
CHST5, also known as GlcNAc6ST-3, is an enzyme involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically keratan sulfate (KS). This process occurs in the Golgi apparatus, where CHST5 catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the C-6 position of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in glycan structures (Ocampo2019Reconstruction; Yu2018Distinct). The enzyme is primarily expressed in the small intestine and colon, where it plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by modifying mucin-type glycoproteins (Yu2018Distinct).

In healthy human cells, CHST5's activity is crucial for the biosynthesis of sulfated glycans, which are important for cell signaling, adhesion, and the organization of the extracellular matrix. The sulfation of keratan sulfate by CHST5 contributes to the biochemical properties of these molecules, such as water solubility and electrical charge, which are essential for their function in various tissues (Akama2001Human). The enzyme's activity is similar to that of CHST6, suggesting a conserved function across species, particularly in maintaining corneal structure (Ocampo2019Reconstruction). Changes in the expression of CHST5 have been observed in pathological conditions, such as colonic carcinogenesis, indicating its role in normal cellular processes (Yu2018Distinct).
