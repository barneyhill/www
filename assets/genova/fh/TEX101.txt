# TEX101

## Overview
TEX101 is a gene that encodes the testis-expressed 101 protein, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein primarily expressed in testicular germ cells. This protein is a member of the LU protein superfamily and plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the maturation of sperm cells, which is essential for male fertility (Shen2014Human; Yoshitake2020Role). TEX101 is involved in key reproductive processes such as the acrosome reaction, sperm migration, and sperm-oocyte fusion, making it vital for successful fertilization (Schiza2019Identification). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as LY6K, underscore its function as a cell-surface chaperone, facilitating the proper trafficking and processing of proteins necessary for sperm function (Endo2016TEX101; Schiza2019Identification). Additionally, TEX101 has clinical significance as a potential biomarker for male infertility and testicular germ cell tumors, with certain genetic variants affecting its expression and function (Burton2022A; Schiza2019Identification).

## Structure
The TEX101 protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) involved in spermatogenesis, primarily expressed in testicular germ cells. It consists of a signal peptide region of 25 amino acids and a mature protein region of 225 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of 24,093 in mice (Yoshitake2020Role). TEX101 is classified as a member of the LU protein superfamily, characterized by the conserved position of cysteine residues, which suggests a similar steric structure due to disulfide bonds (Yoshitake2020Role). The protein contains four potential N-glycosylation sites and numerous serine/threonine residues that could serve as O-glycosylation sites, indicating significant post-translational modifications that are crucial for its biological functions (Yoshitake2020Role).

TEX101 has two LU domains, each containing a three-fingered protein domain (TFPD), which may facilitate interactions with molecules associated with ion channels, important for sperm functions such as the acrosomal reaction and motility hyperactivation (Yoshitake2020Role). The protein exists in at least two forms: a GPI-AP form on the testicular germ cell membrane and a non-membrane-bound soluble form (Yoshitake2020Role).

## Function
TEX101 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein primarily expressed in the testis, specifically in germ cells such as spermatocytes and spermatids. It plays a crucial role in the maturation of sperm cells, which is essential for male fertility (Shen2014Human; Bellil2021Human). TEX101 is involved in the acrosome reaction, a critical process in mammalian fertilization, and is associated with the maturation of male germ cells (Shen2014Human). 

In humans, TEX101 is localized in secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, and testicular spermatozoa, and is stable in seminal plasma, making it a potential biomarker for male infertility (Burton2022A). The protein is involved in sperm migration, zona pellucida binding and penetration, and sperm-oocyte fusion, indicating its role in facilitating successful fertilization (Schiza2019Identification). TEX101 interacts with other proteins, such as LY6K, which is crucial for its proper trafficking and processing, highlighting its role as a cell surface chaperone (Schiza2018Identification; Schiza2019Identification). The presence of TEX101 on the sperm surface and its interactions with other proteins are vital for maintaining the stability and function of spermatozoa (Schiza2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TEX101 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly concerning male fertility. The missense variant rs35033974, which results in a glycine to valine substitution at position 99, is associated with reduced TEX101 protein levels in spermatozoa. This variant is linked to lower TEX101 concentrations in seminal plasma, potentially affecting sperm function and contributing to male infertility (Schiza2018Identification; Schiza2019Identification). Despite its high frequency in certain populations, such as European non-Finnish, the rs35033974 variant is not considered a monogenic cause of infertility, as some homozygous individuals have biological children (Schiza2018Identification; Schiza2019Identification).

Alterations in TEX101 expression are also associated with testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). Decreased TEX101 levels have been observed in patients who later developed TGCT, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Burton2022A). The TEX101 interactome, including proteins like LY6K, is crucial for sperm function, and disruptions in these interactions may contribute to subfertility and TGCT (Burton2022A; Schiza2019Identification). These findings highlight the importance of TEX101 in both fertility and cancer, with potential implications for diagnostics and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
TEX101, a glycoprotein primarily expressed in the testes, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for sperm development and fertility. It forms complexes with LY6K, a GPI-anchored cell-surface protein, which is essential for the proper trafficking and processing of the ADAM3 protein. The interaction between TEX101 and LY6K is mutually dependent, as both proteins contribute to each other's stability and expression on testicular germ cells (Endo2016TEX101; Schiza2019Identification). In the absence of TEX101, LY6K levels are significantly reduced, indicating that TEX101 is crucial for LY6K's post-translational expression (Endo2016TEX101).

TEX101 also interacts with other proteins such as cellubrevin, annexin A2, and DPEP3. Cellubrevin, part of the SNARE family, regulates membrane trafficking of TEX101, while annexin A2 is involved in membrane organization and maintenance of the blood-testis barrier (Yoshitake2020Role). DPEP3, which interacts strongly with TEX101, is not degraded in its absence, suggesting a stable interaction (Schiza2019Identification). These interactions highlight TEX101's role as a cell-surface chaperone, facilitating the maturation of proteins necessary for sperm migration and fertilization (Schiza2019Identification).
