# OR10AC1

## Overview
The OR10AC1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily AC member 1, which is part of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) responsible for detecting odorants. These olfactory receptors are integral membrane proteins that traverse the cell membrane seven times, a characteristic feature of GPCRs, allowing them to interact with odorant molecules in the nasal epithelium and initiate a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The OR10AC1 gene is located on chromosome 11 and is one of many olfactory receptor genes that contribute to the diversity of olfactory perception in humans. Variations in these genes can influence olfactory sensitivity and are of interest in the study of sensory biology and genetic diversity (Qiu2020aarFDC).
