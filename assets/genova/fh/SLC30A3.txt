# SLC30A3

## Overview
The SLC30A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 3, commonly known as ZnT3, which is a zinc transporter protein primarily involved in the regulation of zinc homeostasis within the central nervous system. ZnT3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its six transmembrane domains that facilitate the transport of zinc ions into synaptic vesicles, particularly in glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus and neocortex (Palmiter1996ZnT3; McAllister2017Zinc). This transport is crucial for modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity, impacting various neuronal processes and cognitive functions (Kambe2015The). The protein's function is regulated through oligomerization, which is influenced by oxidative stress and involves the formation of dityrosine bonds, affecting its subcellular localization and transport capacity (Salazar2009SLC30A3). Beyond its neurological roles, ZnT3 is also expressed in pancreatic β cells, where it plays a role in insulin production and glucose metabolism (Smidt2009SLC30A3). Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC30A3 gene have been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Lye2019Zinc; PerezBecerril2014Allelic).

## Structure
The SLC30A3 gene encodes the ZnT3 protein, a zinc transporter involved in the sequestration of zinc into synaptic vesicles. ZnT3 is predicted to have six transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-terminal domains located intracellularly (Palmiter1996ZnT3; McAllister2017Zinc). The transmembrane domains I, II, IV, and V form a channel that includes zinc-binding sites composed of histidine and aspartate residues (McAllister2017Zinc).

ZnT3 functions as a Zn2+/H+ antiporter, exchanging zinc ions for protons in acidified intracellular compartments. It forms homodimers through covalent bonds between tyrosine residues on the C-terminal domain, specifically involving tyrosine residues Y357 and Y372. This dimerization is crucial for its intracellular targeting and transport capacity (Salazar2009SLC30A3; McAllister2017Zinc). The dimerization process is enhanced by oxidative stress and involves the formation of dityrosine bonds, which regulate the protein's subcellular localization and metal transport capacity (Salazar2009SLC30A3).

The ZnT3 protein can also form heterodimers with other zinc transporters, which may alter its localization and function (McAllister2017Zinc). These structural features and interactions are essential for ZnT3's role in zinc homeostasis within the central nervous system.

## Function
The SLC30A3 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZnT3, which plays a critical role in maintaining zinc homeostasis in healthy human cells. ZnT3 is primarily active in the brain, where it facilitates the transport of zinc into synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and neocortex. This synaptic zinc release is crucial for modulating neuronal transmission and plasticity by interacting with various neuronal ion channels, transporters, and neurotransmitter receptors (Kambe2015The). 

ZnT3's function is regulated by oligomerization through dityrosine bonds, which affects its subcellular localization and zinc transport capacity. This oligomerization is essential for efficient zinc accumulation in synaptic-like microvesicles, with specific tyrosine residues playing a key role in this process (Salazar2009SLC30A3). 

Beyond the brain, ZnT3 is expressed in pancreatic β cells, where it influences insulin production and glucose metabolism, particularly under stress conditions (Smidt2009SLC30A3). ZnT3's proper function is vital for preventing age-related cognitive decline and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Kambe2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC30A3 gene, which encodes the zinc transporter ZnT3, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In schizophrenia, significant associations have been found between SLC30A3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the disease, particularly in female subjects. This gender-specific association suggests that estrogen levels might influence the severity of schizophrenia, potentially due to estrogen's role in decreasing ZnT3 expression (McAllister2017Zinc; PerezBecerril2014Allelic). The gene's involvement in synaptic zinc regulation is crucial, as disruptions can affect synaptic transmission and NMDA receptor regulation, both of which are implicated in schizophrenia (PerezBecerril2014Allelic).

SLC30A3 polymorphisms have also been linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). The rs11126936 SNP in SLC30A3 is associated with an increased risk of MDD, with certain genotypes showing higher odds of developing the disorder (Lye2019Zinc). Additionally, a specific mutation, R298C, in the SLC30A3 gene has been associated with febrile seizures, indicating a significant loss-of-function due to impaired zinc transporter activity (Hildebrand2015Loss). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SLC30A3 in various neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
The SLC30A3 gene encodes the zinc transporter protein ZnT3, which is involved in zinc homeostasis and transport within cells. ZnT3 participates in oligomerization through covalent dityrosine bonds, particularly involving tyrosine residues Y357 and Y372. This oligomerization affects its subcellular localization and zinc transport capacity. The Y357F mutation enhances oligomerization, while the Y372F mutation reduces it, indicating that these interactions are crucial for ZnT3's function (Salazar2009SLC30A3).

ZnT3 forms homodimers through covalent bonds between tyrosine residues on its C-terminal domain. These interactions are influenced by oxidative stress, which enhances dimer formation and affects ZnT3's targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) (Salazar2009SLC30A3; McAllister2017Zinc). ZnT3 can also form heterodimers with other zinc transporter proteins, altering its localization and function (McAllister2017Zinc).

The oligomerization of ZnT3 is a regulatory mechanism that may be common among other members of the SLC30A family, suggesting that similar interactions could influence the function of related proteins (Salazar2009SLC30A3).
