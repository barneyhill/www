# KIF11

## Overview
KIF11 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 11, a motor protein that plays a pivotal role in cell division. As a member of the kinesin superfamily, KIF11 is primarily involved in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis. The protein is characterized by its ability to form a bipolar homotetramer, which facilitates the crosslinking and sliding of microtubules, ensuring proper spindle assembly and function (Verhey2015The; Gao2024Mitotic). KIF11's activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation through mitotic kinases, which modulate its function during cell division (Gao2024Mitotic). Mutations in the KIF11 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including microcephaly and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Ostergaard2012Mutations; Wang2022Update). Additionally, KIF11 has been implicated in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2021Upregulation).

## Structure
KIF11, also known as kinesin family member 11, is a motor protein essential for mitotic spindle formation. The primary structure of KIF11 consists of 1057 amino acids, encoded by the KIF11 gene located on chromosome 10 (Gao2024Mitotic). The protein is organized into three main domains: the N-terminal motor domain, the stalk domain, and the C-terminal tail domain (Song2015Specific). The motor domain, comprising residues 1-360, is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, featuring a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Gao2024Mitotic). 

The secondary structure includes extensive coiled-coil regions, particularly in the stalk domain, which facilitate dimerization (Verhey2015The). The tertiary structure of KIF11 is crucial for its function, allowing it to form a homotetramer in its quaternary structure, enabling the crosslinking and sliding of anti-parallel microtubules (Verhey2015The). 

The tail domain, spanning residues 762-1056, is essential for protein-protein interactions, such as binding with ZBP1, which is crucial for β-actin mRNA transport and cell motility (Song2015Specific). KIF11 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by mitotic kinases like CDK1, PLK1, and AURKA, which regulate its activity during cell division (Gao2024Mitotic).

## Function
KIF11, also known as kinesin family member 11, is a motor protein that plays a critical role in mitosis, particularly in the formation and maintenance of the mitotic spindle. It functions as a bipolar homotetramer with three domains: the N-terminal motor domain, the stalk domain, and the tail domain. The motor domain binds to microtubules and hydrolyzes ATP, facilitating movement and cooperation between motor domains (Gao2024Mitotic). KIF11 is essential for the formation of bipolar spindles, which are crucial for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. It achieves this by crosslinking and sliding anti-parallel microtubules apart through plus-end-directed motility (Gao2024Mitotic).

In healthy human cells, KIF11 ensures proper separation of chromosomes, preventing errors that could lead to aneuploidy or other mitotic defects (Gao2024Mitotic). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm during mitosis, where it is involved in centrosome separation and spindle assembly (Venuto2020TRIM8). KIF11's activity is regulated by several mitotic kinases, including CDK1, PLK1, and AURKA, which phosphorylate KIF11 to control its positioning and function during mitosis (Gao2024Mitotic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF11 gene are associated with several autosomal dominant disorders, including microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, and intellectual disability (MCLMR). These mutations can lead to conditions such as microcephaly, congenital lymphedema, and chorioretinopathy, collectively known as MLCRD syndrome (Ostergaard2012Mutations; Wang2020A). KIF11 mutations are also implicated in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a retinal vascular disorder characterized by arrested retinal angiogenesis and complications like retinal detachment (Chen2020Novel; Wang2022Update).

The phenotypic spectrum of KIF11-related disorders is broad, with some patients exhibiting severe ocular symptoms, such as retinal folds and detachment, alongside neurological features like microcephaly and developmental delays (Mirzaa2014Congenital; Robitaille2014Phenotypic). In cancer, particularly glioma and colorectal cancer, altered KIF11 expression is linked to increased tumor proliferation and drug resistance, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target (Liu2021Upregulation; NeskaDługosz2021Prognostic). These findings underscore the critical role of KIF11 in both developmental disorders and cancer pathogenesis.

## Interactions
KIF11, also known as Eg5, is a motor protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In ovarian cancer cells, KIF11 interacts with Death Receptor 6 (DR6), and this interaction is significant for promoting cancer cell migration. The interaction between KIF11 and DR6 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, and it is suggested that KIF11, along with TRAF4, forms a complex with DR6 that enhances cell migration via the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (Shi2018Death).

KIF11 also interacts with ZBP1, an RNA-binding protein, which is essential for the transport and localization of β-actin mRNA in fibroblasts. This interaction is mediated by the tail domain of KIF11 and the RRM12 domain of ZBP1. The KIF11-ZBP1 interaction is crucial for cell motility and the proper localization of β-actin mRNA at the cell leading edge (Song2015Specific).

In mitotic processes, KIF11 interacts with TRIM8, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is important for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosomal stability. This interaction is crucial for centrosome separation and proper mitotic progression (Venuto2020TRIM8).
