# P2RY4

## Overview
The P2RY4 gene encodes the pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y4, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily activated by uridine triphosphate (UTP) in humans. This receptor is part of the larger family of purinergic receptors, which are involved in a variety of physiological processes through their role in signal transduction. The P2Y4 receptor is expressed in several tissues, including the intestine, lung, heart, pancreas, and placenta, where it contributes to the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion. Variants of the P2RY4 gene, such as the N178T loss-of-function mutation, have been linked to protective effects against coronary artery disease and improved glucose regulation, highlighting the gene's potential clinical significance in cardiometabolic health (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction).

## Function
The P2RY4 gene encodes the P2Y4 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily responsive to uridine triphosphate (UTP) in humans. This receptor is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of ion channels and intracellular calcium signaling. It is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the intestine, lung, heart, pancreas, and placenta, where it plays a role in fluid and electrolyte balance, contributing to physiological functions like digestion and absorption (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction).

The P2Y4 receptor can couple with Gq/11 and Gi proteins, which are involved in signal transduction pathways that have an antilipolytic effect, influencing lipid metabolism. This receptor's activity affects the regulation of chloride and potassium channels, as well as intracellular calcium levels, particularly in pancreatic ducts, suggesting a role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction). The receptor's involvement in these processes indicates its potential impact on glucose homeostasis and metabolic regulation, as evidenced by studies showing improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in P2Y4 knockout mice (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction). Overall, the P2Y4 receptor is implicated in both cardiac protection and metabolic regulation, with specific variants showing protective effects against coronary artery disease and metabolic disorders (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the P2RY4 gene, particularly the N178T variant, have been associated with decreased severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and improved glucose homeostasis. This variant is a loss-of-function mutation located in the second extracellular loop of the P2Y4 receptor. It is found less frequently in CAD patients compared to controls, suggesting a protective role against the disease. Carriers of the N178T variant exhibit lower jeopardy and Gensini cardiac severity scores, reduced resting heart rates, and decreased plasma levels of NT-proBNP and fasting glucose, indicating less severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and better glucose regulation (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction).

In P2Y4 knockout mice, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were observed, which were dependent on adiponectin, highlighting the receptor's role in glucose metabolism (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction). The N178T variant also results in a reduced calcium response to UTP and ATP in transfected cells, further supporting its loss-of-function nature (Horckmans2022Lossoffunction). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of P2RY4 gene mutations in cardiometabolic health, suggesting that alterations in P2RY4 expression or function could impact cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.
