# TDRD15

## Overview
TDRD15 is a gene that encodes the protein tudor domain containing 15, which is part of the tudor domain protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of tudor domains, which are known for their role in recognizing and binding methylated arginine and lysine residues on histones and other proteins. The TDRD15 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing. It plays a significant role in the development and function of germ cells, and its dysregulation has been implicated in certain pathological conditions. The protein's interactions and functions are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cellular responses to environmental cues (Qiu2020aarFDC).
