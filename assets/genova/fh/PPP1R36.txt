# PPP1R36

## Overview
The PPP1R36 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 36, a regulatory component of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in a wide array of cellular processes such as metabolism, immune response, and cell division. This protein is particularly significant in the context of spermatogenesis, where it is highly expressed in the testes and plays a crucial role in promoting autophagy, a process vital for cellular homeostasis and germ cell development (Bonnemaijer2019Multitrait; Zhang2016The). PPP1R36 interacts with Atg16L1, enhancing autophagosome formation, especially under nutrient-deprived conditions, and is present in the acrosome of mature spermatozoa, indicating its potential role in sperm activity (Zhang2016The). Additionally, PPP1R36 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including male infertility and tumor progression, highlighting its importance in both reproductive health and disease mechanisms (Di2021Wholegenome; Vargas2021Genome).

## Function
PPP1R36 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, immune response, apoptosis, meiosis, and mitosis (Bonnemaijer2019Multitrait). In the context of spermatogenesis, PPP1R36 is highly expressed in the testes and is involved in promoting autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and germ cell development (Zhang2016The). The protein is particularly active during the first wave of spermatogenesis, where it enhances autophagosome formation, especially under nutrient-deprived conditions (Zhang2016The).

PPP1R36 interacts with Atg16L1, a protein involved in autophagy, suggesting its role in regulating this process during spermatogenesis (Zhang2016The). It is also present in the acrosome of mature spermatozoa, indicating a potential role in sperm activity (Zhang2016The). In human testis, PPP1R36 is identified as a candidate early marker for spermatogonial stem cells, suggesting its involvement in early stages of spermatogonial development (Guo2018The). The gene's expression in these cells highlights its potential role in maintaining the niche environment necessary for stem cell function (Guo2018The).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R36 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions through alterations in its methylation and expression levels. In cryptozoospermic men, the promoter region of PPP1R36 is hypermethylated, which correlates with lower expression levels. This dysregulation is associated with spermatogenic failure, potentially contributing to premature abortion of spermatogenesis (Di2021Wholegenome). In the context of soft tissue sarcomas, increased methylation levels of PPP1R36 have been observed in metastatic leiomyosarcomas compared to primary tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Vargas2021Genome).

PPP1R36 is also identified as a potential biomarker for male infertility conditions such as teratozoospermia and azoospermia. It is listed among genes that may serve as diagnostic markers for these conditions, indicating its involvement in abnormal sperm morphology and absence of sperm in semen (Das2022A). Additionally, PPP1R36 has the highest betweenness centrality in a protein-protein interaction network related to these infertility conditions, highlighting its potential importance in the network's information flow and its implications in disease mechanisms (Das2022A).

## Interactions
PPP1R36, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One notable interaction is with Atg16L1, a protein crucial for autophagosome formation. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence analysis, suggesting that PPP1R36 enhances autophagy during spermatogenesis by promoting autophagosome formation (Zhang2016The). The interaction between PPP1R36 and Atg16L1 is significant as Atg16L1 is known to interact with the Atg12-Atg5 complex, which acts as an E3-like ubiquitin ligase to promote LC3 lipidation, a key step in autophagy (Zhang2016The).

In addition to its role in autophagy, PPP1R36 has been implicated in the regulation of optic disc parameters through its genetic association with the PLEKHG3 locus. Although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed, the gene's involvement in cellular processes such as metabolism, immune response, and cytoskeletal reorganization suggests potential interactions with various cellular pathways (Bonnemaijer2019Multitrait). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PPP1R36 in cellular regulation and its potential impact on both reproductive and ocular health.
