# KCNA4

## Overview
The KCNA4 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 4, commonly referred to as Kv1.4, which is a crucial component of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane-spanning domains and is primarily involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. Kv1.4 channels are integral to the fast repolarization of action potentials in both neuronal and cardiac tissues, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining the electrical activity necessary for proper cellular function (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency; FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4). The channel is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, including regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and is also present in cardiac cells where it influences the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency; FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4). Kv1.4's function is modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as PSD-95 and Kvβ subunits, which affect its localization and gating properties, highlighting its involvement in complex cellular processes and potential implications in neurological disorders (Bett2011A).

## Structure
The KCNA4 gene encodes the Kv1.4 protein, a voltage-gated potassium channel characterized by its structure and function. The protein consists of six transmembrane-spanning domains (S1-S6), with the S4 domain acting as the voltage sensor due to its positively charged amino acids at every third position, creating a regularly spaced array of 5-7 positive charges (FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4). The ion conduction pathway is formed by a sequence of approximately 20 amino acids in the P-region between the S4-S5 linker, with the S5-P-S6 sections facing each other to create a central pore (FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4).

The Kv1.4 channel is involved in fast repolarizing action potentials and is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the striatal neurons, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency). It is part of the A-type current subclass of potassium channels, which are crucial for neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency). The channel displays two types of inactivations, N-type and C-type, associated with distinct molecular domains (FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4).

The KCNA4 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function. The quaternary structure involves forming tetrameric complexes, essential for the channel's proper function (Bett2011A). The protein's structure includes transmembrane helices typical of ion channels, but specific details on primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not fully detailed in the available context (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency).

## Function
The KCNA4 gene encodes the Kv1.4 protein, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the A-type current subclass. These channels are crucial for producing fast repolarizing action potentials, which are essential for maintaining the electrical activity of neurons and muscle cells (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency; FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4). Kv1.4 channels are tetrameric and consist of six membrane-spanning domains, with the S4 domain acting as the voltage sensor due to its positively charged amino acids (FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4). 

In neurons, Kv1.4 channels influence excitability and neurotransmitter release, playing a significant role in modulating cell excitability by controlling potassium ion permeability across the cell membrane (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency). They are highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in axonal membranes near terminals, and are involved in various brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency). 

In cardiac cells, the KCNA4 channel is integral to the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential, influencing cardiac muscle contraction and the heart's response to stimuli such as exercise (FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4). The channel's function is essential for maintaining the timing and rhythm of cardiac muscle contractions, which are necessary for effective cardiac output and oxygen delivery to muscles (FlechaVelazquez2019KCNA4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNA4 gene have been linked to a novel autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A specific missense variant, p.Arg89Gln, was identified in affected individuals from a consanguineous family, leading to clinical features such as growth retardation, microcephaly, bilateral cataracts, ADHD, cognitive impairment, and dystonia. Neurological examinations revealed brisk deep tendon reflexes, cogwheel rigidity, dystonic posturing, and spastic gait, with MRI scans showing bilateral thinning of the lentiform nucleus and swelling of the caudate heads (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency).

Electrophysiological studies have shown that the p.Arg89Gln variant results in a loss-of-function defect, reducing the whole-cell current amplitude in Kv1.4 Arg89Gln channels (Kaya2016KCNA4deficiency). This loss-of-function mechanism is responsible for the disorder, although the exact pathway through which KCNA4 mutations lead to intellectual disability remains unclear (Kessi2020Intellectual).

Alterations in KCNA4 expression have also been associated with changes in pain perception, particularly in inflammatory conditions, due to its role in modulating nociceptor excitability (Langeslag2014Reduced).

## Interactions
KCNA4 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel protein that is integral to regulating membrane potential and neuronal excitability. This protein interacts with several other proteins that influence its localization and function. One significant interaction is with PSD-95, a synaptic scaffolding protein. PSD-95 anchors KCNA4 to synaptic membranes, which is crucial for its proper localization and function within neuronal cells. 

KCNA4 also interacts with Kvβ subunits, which are auxiliary proteins that modulate the activity of the potassium channel. These interactions with Kvβ subunits can affect the channel's gating properties and, consequently, its role in cellular signaling pathways. 

These interactions are essential for the physiological roles of KCNA4, as they influence the channel's localization at the synapse and its functional properties, thereby impacting neuronal excitability and signaling. The modulation of KCNA4 by these protein interactions highlights its role in complex cellular processes and its potential involvement in various neurological functions and disorders.
