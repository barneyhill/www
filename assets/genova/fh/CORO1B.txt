# CORO1B

## Overview
CORO1B is a gene that encodes the protein coronin 1B, which is a member of the coronin family of actin-binding proteins. Coronin 1B plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell motility, structure, and signaling. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and is particularly concentrated at the leading edge of migrating cells, where it interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to modulate actin filament nucleation and branching. The activity of coronin 1B is regulated by phosphorylation, notably by protein kinase C (PKC), which influences its interaction with other proteins and its role in cellular dynamics (Cai2005Phosphorylation). Coronin 1B is also involved in maintaining endothelial cell junction integrity and modulating vascular smooth muscle cell migration, highlighting its significance in vascular biology and potential implications in disease states such as atherosclerosis and cancer metastasis (Williams2012Role; Werner2020Coronin).

## Function
Coronin 1B (CORO1B) is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for cell motility and structure. In mammalian cells, CORO1B is ubiquitously expressed and localizes at the leading edge of fibroblasts, where it interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, a key player in actin filament nucleation (Cai2005Phosphorylation). This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation through protein kinase C (PKC), specifically at the serine 2 (Ser-2) residue, which affects cell motility and leading edge dynamics (Cai2005Phosphorylation).

CORO1B is also involved in endothelial cell function, where it controls actin dynamics at cell-cell junctions and is essential for endothelial network assembly. It colocalizes with VE-cadherin at these junctions, contributing to the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity and cell junction organization (Werner2020Coronin). In vascular smooth muscle cells, CORO1B modulates lamellipodia dynamics and cell migration in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation, highlighting its role in actin polymerization and cellular movement (Williams2012Role). These functions underscore CORO1B's critical role in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating dynamic cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CORO1B gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly those involving cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), CORO1B plays a critical role in regulating migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Downregulation of CORO1B enhances lamellipodia protrusion, increasing cell migration, which is significant in the context of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. These conditions involve the accumulation of VSMCs in the intimal layer of blood vessels, leading to vessel narrowing and potential thrombosis (Williams2012Role).

CORO1B phosphorylation, mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), modulates its interaction with the ARP2/3 complex, affecting actin dynamics and cell migration. This phosphorylation is crucial for PDGF-induced migration, and its dysregulation may contribute to pathological vascular remodeling (Williams2012Role).

In cancer, alterations in CORO1B expression or function could influence metastasis due to its role in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell motility. While specific diseases directly linked to CORO1B mutations are not detailed, its involvement in cytoskeletal regulation suggests potential implications in conditions involving cytoskeletal dysfunction (Ojeda2014Coronin1).

## Interactions
Coronin 1B (CORO1B) is involved in several key protein interactions that regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell motility. It interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, a critical player in actin filament branching. This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation state of Coronin 1B, specifically at serine 2 (Ser-2). Phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) reduces Coronin 1B's affinity for the Arp2/3 complex, affecting cell motility and actin dynamics (Cai2005Phosphorylation; Howell2015WISp39).

Coronin 1B also interacts with WISp39, which binds to its phosphorylated form. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cell motility, as WISp39 facilitates the dephosphorylation of Coronin 1B by Slingshot phosphatase (SSH), allowing it to bind the Arp2/3 complex and influence actin dynamics (Howell2015WISp39).

In endothelial cells, Coronin 1B is involved in actin remodeling at cell-cell junctions and interacts with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and α-parvin (α-pv), playing a role in integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions (Werner2020Coronin). These interactions highlight Coronin 1B's role in cellular processes such as migration and network assembly.
