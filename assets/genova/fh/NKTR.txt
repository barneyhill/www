# NKTR

## Overview
The NKTR gene encodes the natural killer cell triggering receptor, a type of transmembrane receptor involved in the immune response. This receptor plays a crucial role in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which are essential components of the innate immune system. NK cells are responsible for identifying and destroying virally infected cells and tumor cells, and the NKTR-encoded receptor facilitates this process by recognizing specific ligands on target cells. The interaction between the receptor and its ligands triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling events that lead to the activation of NK cell cytotoxic functions. Understanding the structure and function of the NKTR gene and its encoded receptor is vital for elucidating the mechanisms of immune surveillance and developing therapeutic strategies for diseases involving immune dysfunction.
