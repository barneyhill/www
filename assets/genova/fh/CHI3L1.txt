# CHI3L1

## Overview
The CHI3L1 gene encodes the protein chitinase 3-like 1, also known as YKL-40, which is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 18. Despite its classification, the protein lacks enzymatic chitinase activity but retains the ability to bind chitin and other molecules, playing a significant role in various biological processes. CHI3L1 is involved in cell proliferation, survival, and adhesion, acting as a mitogen and chemotactic factor for several cell types. It is implicated in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immune responses, and is characterized as a myokine in skeletal muscle. The protein interacts with multiple receptors and proteins, influencing signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis, cell growth, and metastasis. Clinically, CHI3L1 is associated with various diseases, including cancers, neurological disorders, and inflammatory conditions, where its altered expression correlates with disease progression and prognosis (Zhao2020Chitinase-3; Coffman2008Chitinase; Yu2024Significance).

## Structure
The CHI3L1 protein, also known as YKL-40, is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 18 and is characterized by a distinctive molecular structure. It features a (β/α)8-barrel fold, which is a common motif in enzymes, and includes a β+α domain insertion (Zhao2020Chitinase-3). The three-dimensional structure of CHI3L1 consists of an (β/α)8-barrel domain and a second domain composed of six antiparallel β-strands, with an α-helix inserted after strand β7 (Zhao2020Chitinase-3). 

The protein contains a carbohydrate-binding motif (CBM) at the C-terminal region, which is crucial for binding chitin and chito-oligosaccharides despite the absence of enzymatic chitinase activity (Chen2011Carbohydratebinding). This CBM is involved in significant conformational changes upon binding and is essential for activating the Akt signaling pathway in colonic epithelial cells (Chen2011Carbohydratebinding). 

CHI3L1 also includes a KR-rich domain responsible for heparin binding, which plays a significant role in its biological activity (Zhao2020Chitinase-3). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its interactions and functions (He2020NGlycosylation). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CHI3L1, also known as chitinase 3-like 1, is a glycoprotein involved in various biological processes in healthy human cells. Despite lacking enzymatic activity, CHI3L1 binds to chitin and other molecules, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and adhesion (Zhao2020Chitinase-3; Coffman2008Chitinase). It acts as a mitogen and chemotactic factor for several cell types, including fibroblasts, eosinophils, and vascular smooth muscle cells, through AKT-dependent and ERK-mediated mechanisms (Coffman2008Chitinase). CHI3L1 is involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis, promoting the growth of synovial cells and fibroblasts, and acting as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells (Coffman2008Chitinase).

In skeletal muscle, CHI3L1 is characterized as a myokine that promotes myoblast proliferation, crucial for muscle adaptation and repair, mediated through PAR-2 signaling (Görgens2015The). It also plays a protective role against TNFα-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in muscle cells by inhibiting NF-κB activation (Görgens2014Chitinase3like). CHI3L1 regulates extracellular matrix activities, inhibiting the degradation of type I collagen and hyaluronic acid, and modulating matrix metalloproteinase activity, which impacts cell adhesion and tissue remodeling (Zhao2020Chitinase-3).

## Clinical Significance
The CHI3L1 gene is implicated in a variety of diseases due to its role in inflammation and tissue remodeling. Altered expression of CHI3L1 is associated with several cancers, including lung, liver, colorectal, breast, ovarian, and glioblastoma multiforme. In these cancers, elevated CHI3L1 levels correlate with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis (Yu2024Significance; Zhao2020Chitinase-3). In lung cancer, CHI3L1 inhibits apoptosis and promotes tumor growth by interacting with the TRAIL signaling pathway and TMEM219 (Yu2024Significance). In liver cancer, it activates inflammatory pathways and modulates TGFβ signaling, contributing to tumor growth and poor prognosis (Yu2024Significance).

CHI3L1 is also linked to neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In schizophrenia, CHI3L1 is upregulated in the hippocampus and associated with prefrontal dysfunction and neuroinflammation (Yu2024Significance). In Alzheimer's disease, it contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal death by regulating IL-6 and activating astrocytes (Yu2024Significance).

In inflammatory diseases, CHI3L1 is involved in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, where it acts as a candidate autoantigen and correlates with proinflammatory mediators (Yeo2019Roles). Elevated CHI3L1 levels are also linked to chronic liver inflammation and fibrosis (Yeo2019Roles).

## Interactions
CHI3L1, also known as chitinase 3-like 1, interacts with several proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in various cellular processes and disease mechanisms. It forms a multimeric complex with IL-13Rα2 and IL-13, activating signaling pathways such as MAPK/Erk, Akt, and Wnt/β-catenin, which are involved in regulating apoptosis, cell death, and metastasis (Zhao2020Chitinase-3). N-glycosylation is essential for the binding of CHI3L1 and IL-13 to IL-13Rα2. TMEM219 is another protein that binds in the CHI3L1-IL-13Rα2-TMEM219 complex, enhancing HB-EGF expression through MAPK/Erk and PKB/Akt pathways (Zhao2020Chitinase-3).

CHI3L1 also interacts with CD44, a cell surface adhesion receptor, to activate signaling pathways that promote cell growth and metastasis in gastric cancer. This interaction is crucial for gastric cancer cell colony formation, migration, and invasion, and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analyses (Geng2018Chitinase). The CHI3L1/CD44 axis enhances gastric cancer metastasis by activating the MAPK/Erk, Akt/PKB, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which are blocked by a CD44 neutralizing antibody (Geng2018Chitinase). CHI3L1 also interacts with CRTH2 to promote fibrotic responses in lung tissue (Zhao2020Chitinase-3).
