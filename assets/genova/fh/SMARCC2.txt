# SMARCC2

## Overview
SMARCC2 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily c member 2, which is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This protein is integral to the regulation of chromatin architecture and gene expression, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair. As a chromatin remodeler, SMARCC2 is involved in modulating DNA accessibility, thereby influencing cell differentiation, proliferation, and development (Li2021SMARCC2; Mashtalir2018Modular). The protein contains functional domains, including the SWIRM and SANT domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and DNA, contributing to its role in chromatin remodeling and tumor suppression (Li2022SMARCC2). Alterations in the SMARCC2 gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Magarifuchi2024Gene; Li2022SMARCC2).

## Structure
The SMARCC2 protein is a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function. It contains two functional domains: the SWIRM domain (Ile424-Thr521) and the SANT domain (Ser596-Pro647). The SWIRM domain is positioned closer to the nucleosome and is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with histone octamers, through hydrogen bond interactions with specific amino acid residues (Li2022SMARCC2). This domain is critical for chromatin remodeling and tumor suppression, as it forms a stabilizer complex with a region of SMARCB1 (Li2022SMARCC2).

The SANT domain is located at the distal end of the complex and is associated with DNA binding, although it is considered less critical for chromatin remodeling compared to the SWIRM domain (Li2022SMARCC2). SMARCC2 is part of the core module of the BAF complex, forming a helical bundle with other subunits, and is involved in forming a V-shaped structure that interacts with the nucleosome core particle (Mashtalir2020A). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and its activity may be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation.

## Function
SMARCC2 is a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating chromatin architecture and gene expression by altering DNA accessibility. This complex is essential for various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, and repair, by modulating chromatin dynamics (Mashtalir2018Modular). SMARCC2, along with SMARCB1, forms a stable subcomplex that is vital for the assembly and tumor suppression function of the BAF complex, a subtype of the SWI/SNF complex. This subcomplex is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the BAF complex, which is important for chromatin remodeling (Chen2020A).

In healthy human cells, SMARCC2 is involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and development. It is active in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin dynamics to regulate gene expression (Li2021SMARCC2). The protein's role in chromatin remodeling is fundamental to its function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. SMARCC2's interaction with other subunits, such as SMARCD, is crucial for the stability and assembly of the mSWI/SNF complex, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Mashtalir2018Modular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SMARCC2 gene, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (OHGSC), SMARCC2 gene amplification is associated with significantly decreased overall survival. This amplification occurs in approximately 3.1% of OHGSC cases and is considered an unfavorable prognostic factor (Magarifuchi2024Gene). 

In glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, SMARCC2 functions as a tumor suppressor. Low expression of SMARCC2 is linked to poor prognosis, while its overexpression reduces cell proliferation and tumor size. SMARCC2 inhibits the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and regulates the expression of the DKK1 gene, which is associated with tumor growth (Li2022SMARCC2). 

In pancreatic cancer, SMARCC2 is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitination ligase FBXO28, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The downregulation of SMARCC2 by FBXO28 is linked to advanced disease stages and poor outcomes (Liu2023FBXO28). These findings suggest that SMARCC2 plays a critical role in tumor suppression across different cancer types, and its dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression.

## Interactions
SMARCC2, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, participates in several critical protein interactions. It forms a stable subcomplex with SMARCB1, where the Rpt1 and Rpt2 motifs of SMARCB1 bind to the SWIRM domains of SMARCC2, creating a heterotrimeric assembly essential for the BAF complex's tumor suppression function (Chen2020A). SMARCC2 also interacts with c-Myc, a well-known oncogene, and TPD52L2 in glioma cells. This interaction is significant as SMARCC2 downregulates c-Myc expression, potentially inhibiting its oncogenic functions (Li2021SMARCC2).

In pancreatic cancer cells, SMARCC2 is targeted by FBXO28, an E3 ligase, which promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in pancreatic cancer (Liu2023FBXO28). SMARCC2's stability is also influenced by lysine methylation, where SET7 methyltransferase and LSD1 demethylase play roles in its proteolysis and interaction with L3MBTL3, which recruits the CRL4 DCAF5 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex for degradation (Guo2022The). These interactions highlight SMARCC2's role in chromatin remodeling and its potential impact on cancer progression.
