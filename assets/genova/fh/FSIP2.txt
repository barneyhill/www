# FSIP2

## Overview
FSIP2, or fibrous sheath interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural organization and function of the sperm flagellum. The FSIP2 protein is categorized as a structural protein, primarily involved in the formation and stabilization of the fibrous sheath and mitochondrial sheath within the sperm flagellum. It plays a crucial role in sperm motility and morphology by interacting with key proteins such as A-kinase anchoring protein 4 (AKAP4), which is essential for the proper assembly of the fibrous sheath. FSIP2 is specifically expressed in the testis and is critical for the processes of spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. Mutations in the FSIP2 gene are linked to male infertility conditions, such as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) and asthenoteratozoospermia, due to their impact on the structural integrity and function of the sperm flagellum (Lv2023Novel; Martinez2018Wholeexome).

## Function
The FSIP2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the structural organization and function of the sperm flagellum, particularly within the fibrous sheath (FS) and mitochondrial sheath (MS) (Lv2023Novel; Martinez2018Wholeexome). In healthy human cells, FSIP2 is involved in maintaining the integrity of the sperm flagellum by interacting with AKAP4, a major component of the FS, which is essential for proper sperm motility and morphology (Lv2023Novel; Martinez2018Wholeexome). FSIP2 is believed to participate in intra-flagellar transport, potentially binding to IFT20, a component of IFT-B complexes crucial for flagellar assembly (Lv2023Novel).

FSIP2 is transcribed during late spermatocyte development and is involved in the process of mitochondria multiplication during meiosis and early spermatogenesis. It also plays a role in the retention of mitochondria during the differentiation of round spermatids into elongated spermatids (Lv2023Novel). The protein is specifically expressed in the testis and is not detected in other ciliated tissues, highlighting its specialized function in sperm development (Martinez2018Wholeexome). FSIP2's role in mitochondrial organization and the termination of MS extension during spermatogenesis is crucial for normal sperm function and fertility (Lv2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FSIP2 gene are associated with several conditions affecting male fertility, primarily due to their impact on sperm structure and function. FSIP2 mutations are a recurrent cause of multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition characterized by severe disorganization of the fibrous sheath and axonemal structures, leading to impaired sperm motility and morphology (Liu2021Novel; Martinez2018Wholeexome). These mutations often result in the absence of the AKAP4 protein, which is crucial for the proper assembly and stability of the sperm flagellum (Martinez2018Wholeexome).

FSIP2 variants have also been linked to asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology. This is due to severe disassembly of the fibrous sheath and axonemal defects, resulting in spermatozoa with elongated mitochondrial sheaths and altered mitochondrial function (Lv2023Novel). The deficiency in FSIP2 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to the asthenoteratozoospermia phenotype (Lv2023Novel).

Despite these challenges, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been shown to be an effective treatment for individuals with FSIP2-associated infertility, leading to successful pregnancies in some cases (Lv2023Novel).

## Interactions
FSIP2 (fibrous sheath interacting protein 2) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the structural organization and function of sperm flagella. One of the primary interactions of FSIP2 is with A-kinase anchoring protein 4 (AKAP4), a key scaffold protein in the fibrous sheath. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and stability of the fibrous sheath, as well as for anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to AKAP4, which is crucial for sperm motility (Martinez2018Wholeexome).

In FSIP2-deficient patients, the absence of AKAP4 from the sperm flagellum correlates with severe flagellar abnormalities, indicating the importance of this interaction in maintaining flagellar structure (Martinez2018Wholeexome). Additionally, FSIP2 mutations result in the absence of AKAP4 protein in spermatozoa, highlighting the critical role of FSIP2 in the assembly of the axoneme and the fibrous sheath (Martinez2018Wholeexome).

FSIP2 also interacts with mRNA, as evidenced by its recruitment into phase-separated droplets by CEP112, a protein involved in the translational regulation of fertility genes. This interaction suggests a role for FSIP2 in the localized regulation of essential fertility mRNAs during spermiogenesis (Zhang2024CEP112).
