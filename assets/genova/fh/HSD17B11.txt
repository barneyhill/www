# HSD17B11

## Overview
HSD17B11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 11, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in steroid metabolism, particularly in the conversion of 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol into androsterone, playing a crucial role in androgen metabolism (Rotinen2011Transcriptional). Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 11 is expressed in a variety of human tissues, including the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, testis, ovary, and sebaceous gland, and is active in the endoplasmic reticulum (Mindnich2004The; Rotinen2011Transcriptional). The enzyme's activity is dependent on NAD(P(H)) and is involved in the reduction or oxidation of sex hormones, fatty acids, and bile acids, contributing to the regulation of androgen and estrogen levels (Rotinen2011Transcriptional). HSD17B11 has been implicated in the pathology of prostate cancer, where it is abundantly expressed, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Rotinen2011Transcriptional; Rotinen2012Regulation).

## Structure


## Function
HSD17B11 encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 11, which plays a significant role in steroid metabolism. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol into androsterone, indicating its function in androgen metabolism (Rotinen2011Transcriptional). It is part of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) family and is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, testis, ovary, and sebaceous gland (Rotinen2011Transcriptional). The enzyme's activity requires NAD(P(H)) and is involved in the reduction or oxidation of sex hormones, fatty acids, and bile acids (Rotinen2011Transcriptional).

HSD17B11 is widely distributed in human tissues, including the pancreas, kidney, liver, lung, adrenal, ovary, endometrial epithelium, syncytiotrophoblasts, sebaceous glands, Leydig cells, and brain (Mindnich2004The). It plays a role in the local and peripheral synthesis and inactivation of steroid hormones, contributing to the regulation of androgen and estrogen levels in various tissues (Mindnich2004The). The enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, influencing processes such as lipid metabolism and cellular differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
HSD17B11 is significantly involved in the pathology of prostate cancer. It is abundantly expressed in prostate cancer tissues but not in normal prostate tissues, suggesting a potential link to advanced prostate cancer (Rotinen2011Transcriptional; Rotinen2012Regulation). The transcriptional regulation of HSD17B11 in prostate cancer cells is mediated by transcription factors such as Sp1 and C/EBPα, which bind to specific sites in the gene's promoter region, influencing its expression levels (Rotinen2011Transcriptional). Mutations in transcription factor binding sites, such as NF-κB and GATA motifs, can alter promoter activity, affecting HSD17B11 expression in different prostate cancer cell lines (Rotinen2011Transcriptional).

In addition to its role in prostate cancer, HSD17B11 has been implicated in androgen metabolism, converting 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol into androsterone, which may influence cancer progression (Rotinen2012Regulation). While the specific role of HSD17B11 in other diseases is not detailed, its involvement in androgen metabolism suggests potential implications in other hormone-related conditions. Further studies are needed to fully understand the clinical significance of HSD17B11 in various diseases (Rotinen2012Regulation).
