# AASS

## Overview
The AASS gene encodes the enzyme α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, a bifunctional enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the lysine degradation pathway in humans. This enzyme is categorized as a metabolic enzyme due to its involvement in amino acid metabolism. It combines the activities of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), facilitating the conversion of lysine to saccharopine and subsequently to α-aminoadipic semialdehyde. The AASS protein is predominantly active in the liver, where it contributes to cellular energy production and nitrogen balance. Its bifunctional nature allows for substrate channeling, enhancing the efficiency of lysine degradation (Houten2013Genetic; Sacksteder2000Identification). Mutations in the AASS gene are linked to hyperlysinemia, a condition characterized by elevated lysine levels, which can lead to various neurological symptoms (Houten2013Genetic). The enzyme's structure includes distinct domains that facilitate its enzymatic functions, and it is known to form dimers and potentially tetramers in its active state (Agostinho2024Aminoadipatesemialdehyde).

## Structure
The AASS protein, encoded by the human AASS gene, is a bifunctional enzyme involved in lysine degradation. It consists of two main domains: the lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) domain and the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain. The full-length protein is composed of 926 amino acids, with the N-terminal 374 amino acids showing similarity to the yeast LYS1 protein and the C-terminal 552 amino acids resembling the yeast LYS9 protein (Sacksteder2000Identification).

The secondary structure of the AASS protein includes elements such as α-helices and β-strands, which are integral to its function. Specifically, the SDH domain features a Rossmann-fold domain that binds NAD+, an α/β structure responsible for substrate binding and dimer interface formation, and an all-helical fold that likely undergoes significant movements upon ligand binding (Agostinho2024Aminoadipatesemialdehyde).

In terms of quaternary structure, the AASS enzyme is known to form a dimer in solution, and it is proposed to oligomerize as a tetramer in its mammalian form (Agostinho2024Aminoadipatesemialdehyde). The dimeric state is crucial for its enzymatic activity, facilitating interactions with cofactors and substrates. The SDH domain, in particular, is a homodimer bound to NAD+, with specific residues playing a role in these interactions (Agostinho2024Aminoadipatesemialdehyde).

## Function
The AASS gene encodes the bifunctional enzyme α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, which plays a critical role in the lysine degradation pathway in humans. This enzyme combines the activities of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), catalyzing the first two steps of lysine degradation. The process begins with the conversion of lysine to saccharopine by LKR, followed by the conversion of saccharopine to α-aminoadipic semialdehyde by SDH (Houten2013Genetic; Sacksteder2000Identification).

The AASS protein is primarily active in the liver, the major site of amino acid metabolism, and is expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression in the liver (Sacksteder2000Identification). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper metabolism of lysine, an essential amino acid, and contributes to cellular energy production and nitrogen balance (Leandro2020Deletion).

In humans, the lysine degradation pathway is suggested to be peroxisomal, with the AASS protein potentially playing a role in peroxisomal lysine degradation pathways (Sacksteder2000Identification). The enzyme's bifunctional nature may provide kinetic advantages, such as substrate channeling, enhancing the efficiency of lysine degradation (Sacksteder2000Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AASS gene, which encodes the enzyme α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, are associated with hyperlysinemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of lysine in the blood and urine (Houten2013Genetic; Sacksteder2000Identification). This condition can lead to neurological symptoms such as hypotonia, microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and seizures (Houten2013Genetic). Hyperlysinemia is caused by deficiencies in the enzyme activities of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), which are both encoded by the AASS gene (Markovitz1984Familial; Sacksteder2000Identification).

In some cases, hyperlysinemia is linked to a contiguous gene deletion syndrome affecting both AASS and PTPRZ1, potentially leading to more severe neurological symptoms (Houten2013Genetic). Although initially thought to cause neurological damage, some studies suggest hyperlysinemia might be a benign metabolic variant, as no adverse effects were observed in certain cases identified through newborn screening (Houten2013Genetic). The relationship between hyperlysinemia and neurological symptoms remains unclear, and the benefits of dietary lysine restriction are uncertain (Houten2013Genetic).
