# ARHGEF18

## Overview
ARHGEF18 is a gene that encodes the Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 18, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving the RhoA and Rac1 GTPases. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is essential for the activation of small GTPases by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. ARHGEF18 is integral to the regulation of epithelial cell structure and function, contributing to the maintenance of apicobasal polarity and the formation of tight and adherens junctions. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, such as Rock II, myosin-IIA, and LKB1, underscore its importance in cell migration, junction formation, and cytoskeletal organization (Beal2020ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF; Arno2017Biallelic). Additionally, ARHGEF18 is involved in the regulation of actomyosin contractility, which is crucial for intercellular communication and cell migration, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and developmental processes (Zaritsky2017Diverse).

## Structure
The ARHGEF18 protein, encoded by the ARHGEF18 gene, is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the regulation of RhoA and Rac1 signaling pathways. The protein structure includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its function as an activator of small GTPases. The DH domain is responsible for the catalytic activity, while the PH domain is thought to mediate membrane localization and protein-protein interactions (Herder2013ArhGEF18).

The ARHGEF18 protein has several isoforms due to alternative splicing. The canonical p114 isoform is a 1015-residue protein, while a novel isoform, LOCGEF-X3, consists of 1361 residues and arises from alternative transcriptional start sites and splicing (Turton2018Expression). The LOCGEF-X3 isoform contains a unique 'LOC' domain at the N-terminus, which may have specific functions in leukocyte activation (Turton2018Expression).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of ARHGEF18, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein's role in maintaining neuro-epithelial apico-basal polarity and proliferation is conserved across vertebrates (Herder2013ArhGEF18).

## Function
The ARHGEF18 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that primarily activates the RHOA GTPase, a critical component in maintaining epithelial cell structure and function. This protein is involved in the regulation of epithelial apicobasal polarity, which is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial cells, particularly in the retina (Arno2017Biallelic). ARHGEF18 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on RHOA, leading to its activation, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell polarity (Arno2017Biallelic).

In healthy cells, ARHGEF18 stimulates cortical actomyosin activation, promoting TJ assembly and cell rounding, which are vital for the integrity of the outer limiting membrane in the retina (Arno2017Biallelic). The protein's interaction with the RHOA pathway also influences actomyosin contractility, affecting intercellular communication and cell migration (Zaritsky2017Diverse). ARHGEF18 is active in the cytoplasm and is necessary for the maturation of cell-cell junctions in both endothelial and epithelial cells, playing a role in organizing actomyosin cytoskeletal components and maintaining neuro-epithelial apicobasal polarity (Turton2018Expression).

## Interactions
ARHGEF18, also known as p114RhoGEF, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It forms complexes with Rock II and myosin-IIA, which are important for junction formation and cell migration, particularly in placenta development (Beal2020ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF; Beal2021ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF). ARHGEF18 interacts with AKAP12, influencing PKA signaling, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Beal2020ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF). It also binds to LKB1, which activates ARHGEF18 in a kinase activity-independent manner, playing a role in junction formation and morphogenesis (Beal2020ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF; Beal2021ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF).

In endothelial cells, ARHGEF18 is recruited to cell-cell junctions via interaction with JACOP, essential for organizing the actin cytoskeleton (Beal2020ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF). It also interacts with ZO-1 and connexin-43, which are involved in cell-cell junctions and placental development (Beal2020ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF; Beal2021ARHGEF18p114RhoGEF). The protein's interaction with Lulu2 is crucial for maintaining the circumferential actomyosin belt in epithelial cells, with phosphorylation by atypical PKC negatively regulating this interaction (Nakajima2011Lulu2). These interactions highlight ARHGEF18's role in coordinating signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics essential for cell fusion and differentiation processes.
