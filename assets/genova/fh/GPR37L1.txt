# GPR37L1

## Overview
GPR37L1 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 37 like 1, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in glial cells such as astrocytes, as well as in peripheral tissues like the heart and kidneys. GPR37L1 plays a significant role in the development and function of astrocytes, influencing processes such as astrocytic tiling and morphology. It is also involved in renal sodium transport and blood pressure regulation through its expression in renal proximal tubule cells. The receptor interacts with various proteins and signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and is implicated in neuroprotective functions. Clinically, mutations in GPR37L1 have been associated with neurological disorders such as anxiety, migraine, and epilepsy, as well as cardiovascular conditions like hypertension. These associations underscore the potential of GPR37L1 as a therapeutic target for a range of diseases (Breitwieser2023Rare; Nguyen2023GPR37L1; Armando2022G).

## Structure
GPR37L1 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a primary structure consisting of 481 amino acids. It features a single potential glycosylation site at Asn 105 in the N-terminus and a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site at Tyr 332, located at the beginning of the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) (Smith2015Drug). The receptor likely adopts the characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs, although specific details on its secondary and tertiary structures are not provided (Smith2015Drug).

Post-translational modifications of GPR37L1 include N-terminal glycosylation and proteolytic processing by matrix metalloproteases, which results in two cell surface species. The larger species is N-glycosylated at Asn 105, while the smaller species is produced by proteolysis (Coleman2020The). This proteolytic processing is significant for receptor activity, as it may inactivate the receptor by removing the N-terminus, which is suggested to be important for constitutive coupling to Gpa1/Gαs (Coleman2020The).

The receptor is highly expressed in glial cells within the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, and has some peripheral expression in the human heart and gastrointestinal system (Smith2015Drug). The quaternary structure and specific domains beyond the general GPCR structure are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The GPR37L1 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor predominantly expressed in mature astrocytes in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in the maturation and organization of astrocytes during brain development. This receptor is involved in astrocytic tiling and process maturation, essential for the proper functioning of astrocytes, including the development of astrocytic domains and the regulation of astrocytic morphology through contact-spacing mechanisms (Nguyen2023GPR37L1). The loss of GPR37L1 results in increased spacing between astrocytes and reduced complexity in astrocytic processes, as observed in knockout mouse models (Nguyen2023GPR37L1).

In the kidney, GPR37L1 is expressed in human renal proximal tubule cells and plays a role in regulating sodium transport and blood pressure. It is located on the apical membrane of renal proximal tubules and modulates the function of the sodium proton exchanger 3 (NHE3), crucial for sodium reabsorption. The receptor signals through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to decrease the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and enhance NHE3 transcription, indicating its role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression related to sodium transport (Armando2022G).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR37L1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and cardiovascular conditions. Rare variants of GPR37L1 are associated with anxiety, migraine, and epilepsy disorders. Studies have identified that these variants can lead to changes in receptor expression and signaling pathways, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of these conditions (Breitwieser2023Rare). In particular, certain missense mutations in GPR37L1 have been linked to altered signaling properties, which may influence the development of migraine and epilepsy (Breitwieser2023Rare).

GPR37L1 has also been associated with cardiovascular functions. Knockout mice lacking GPR37L1 exhibit increased systolic blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting a role in hypertension (Smith2015Drug). Additionally, GPR37L1 expression is altered in cerebellar medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor, where its interaction with the patched 1 (Ptch1) protein affects tumor progression (Massimi2022Mouse).

The gene's involvement in cholesterol homeostasis has been noted, with certain variants affecting cholesterol levels, which may have implications for neurological disorders (Breitwieser2023Rare). These findings highlight the potential of GPR37L1 as a therapeutic target for various diseases.

## Interactions
GPR37L1, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple cellular pathways. It contains a PDZ motif, -GTPC, which facilitates its interaction with proteins possessing PDZ domains, such as PICK1, syntenin, and GRIP. These interactions are similar to those observed with the PAELR protein, which also contains a PDZ motif (Dutta2014The).

In human renal proximal tubule cells, GPR37L1 interacts with several proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, including DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC). These interactions suggest a role for GPR37L1 in epigenetic regulation and cellular signaling (Armando2022G).

GPR37L1 also interacts with the neuroprotective peptide prosaptide, which induces endocytosis of the receptor and stimulates G protein-mediated signaling, specifically ERK phosphorylation in a Gαi/o-dependent manner. This interaction highlights GPR37L1's role in neuroprotective and glioprotective effects (Meyer2013GPR37).

In addition, GPR37L1 is involved in the secretion of the calcium-binding protein S100A5, enhancing its secretion in a calcium-mediated process (Nguyen2020Quantitative).
