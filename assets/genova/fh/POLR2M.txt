# POLR2M

## Overview
POLR2M is a gene that encodes the protein RNA polymerase II subunit M, also known as Gdown1, which is integral to the transcriptional machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is a regulatory subunit of RNA polymerase II, the enzyme responsible for transcribing mRNA from DNA templates. Gdown1 plays a pivotal role in modulating transcription by influencing the transition from initiation to elongation, a critical phase in gene expression. It interacts with various transcription factors and complexes, such as the Mediator complex, to regulate transcriptional pausing and elongation. This regulation is particularly significant in the context of diseases like acute myeloid leukemia, where POLR2M's role in transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in disease progression (Stavast2021The; Li2012Gdown1:). Additionally, POLR2M is part of a complex transcription unit associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, although its specific contributions to this condition require further elucidation (Heliö2021GRINL1A).

## Function
POLR2M encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, known as Gdown1, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation in healthy human cells. This subunit is involved in modulating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation, a critical step in gene expression regulation. Gdown1 interacts with the Mediator complex and elongation factors, influencing the transition from promoter-proximal pausing to productive elongation (Li2012Gdown1:). It competes with the transcription factor TFIIF for binding to RNA polymerase II, affecting the stability and function of the polymerase during early elongation stages (Mullen2014Functional).

Gdown1 is associated with poised polymerases, stabilizing them in a state that is resistant to premature termination and responsive to regulatory signals such as P-TEFb, which facilitates the transition to active elongation (Liu2015Ready; Cheng2012Functional). This poised state is crucial for the synchronous induction of gene expression and integration of cellular signals. Gdown1's presence is particularly noted in regions downstream of the transcription start site, indicating its role in maintaining the stability of paused polymerases and regulating transcription elongation (Cheng2012Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2M gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through its role in the transcriptional silencing of the tumor suppressor gene MIR139. In MLL-AF9 AML cells, POLR2M acts as a negative transcriptional regulator by binding to the MIR139 locus, leading to stable transcriptional pausing and silencing of MIR139. This silencing is crucial for the survival and proliferation of leukemia cells, as the reactivation of MIR139 expression can induce apoptosis and inhibit leukemia progression (Stavast2021The). The study suggests that POLR2M's function in silencing MIR139 is not exclusive to MLL-AF9 AML, indicating a broader role in AML oncogenesis (Stavast2021The).

In the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the POLR2M gene is part of the GRINL1A complex transcription unit, which includes the GCOM1 and MYZAP genes. Although the study primarily focuses on the GCOM1 gene, the association of the GRINL1A complex with fully penetrant recessive DCM suggests a potential involvement of POLR2M in this condition. However, specific mutations in POLR2M related to DCM have not been detailed (Heliö2021GRINL1A).

## Interactions
POLR2M, also known as GDOWN1, is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the MIR139 gene by interacting with RNA Polymerase II (POL-II) to mediate transcriptional pausing. This interaction is crucial for the silencing of MIR139, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Stavast2021The). POLR2M binds to the transcription start site (TSS) and enhancer regions of the MIR139 locus, contributing to the transcriptional pausing of POL-II at these sites (Stavast2021The).

The repressive activity of POLR2M can be reversed through its interaction with the Mediator complex, a multi-subunit protein complex that facilitates transcription by bridging enhancers and promoters. The Mediator complex includes subunits such as MED4, MED6, MED7, MED8, MED10, MED11, MED14, MED17, MED21, and MED22, and interacts with transcription factors, POL-II, and elongation factors (Stavast2022MicroRNA139). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of MIR139, and the phosphorylation of Mediator subunits in response to stress is mentioned as a regulatory mechanism (Stavast2022MicroRNA139).

POLR2M is also part of a complex transcription unit that includes the genes MYZAP and GCOM1, which has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (Heliö2021GRINL1A). However, specific interactions of POLR2M with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed.
