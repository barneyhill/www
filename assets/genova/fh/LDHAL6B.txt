# LDHAL6B

## Overview
LDHAL6B is a gene that encodes the protein lactate dehydrogenase A like 6B, which is a member of the lactate dehydrogenase family. This family of enzymes is primarily involved in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, a critical step in cellular respiration and energy production. The protein encoded by LDHAL6B is categorized as an oxidoreductase, which plays a role in various metabolic pathways by facilitating the transfer of electrons between molecules. Although the specific biological functions and interactions of LDHAL6B are not fully elucidated, it is believed to be involved in metabolic processes similar to other lactate dehydrogenases. Further research is needed to understand its precise role in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in health and disease.
