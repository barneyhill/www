# IQCF5

## Overview
IQCF5 is a gene that encodes the protein IQ motif containing F5, which is part of the IQ motif-containing family. This family is characterized by the presence of IQ motifs, which are known to mediate interactions with calmodulin and other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. The IQCF5 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research has suggested potential roles in neurological and reproductive systems, as well as associations with certain diseases, such as sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and prostate cancer (Albawardi2021Copy; Xie2014A). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in human health and disease, warranting further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and interactions.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The IQCF5 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions, although its clinical significance is not fully understood. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified IQCF5 as one of the top-ranking candidate loci associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) in Chinese Han populations. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of sALS, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Xie2014A). 

In prostate cancer, particularly among men of Middle Eastern ancestry, amplifications in the IQ motif-containing family of genes, including IQCF5, occur more frequently compared to European populations. However, the clinical significance of these amplifications is not directly addressed, indicating a need for further research to understand their impact (Albawardi2021Copy).

Additionally, a study on sperm quality in swine identified a novel splice donor variant in the IQCF5 gene, predicted to have a high impact on protein sequence. This variant, however, showed almost no linkage disequilibrium with the GWAS hit, suggesting limited direct association (Gòdia2020A). Further research is necessary to elucidate the clinical implications of IQCF5 in these and potentially other conditions.
