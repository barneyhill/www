# C9orf78

## Overview
C9orf78 is a gene that encodes the protein chromosome 9 open reading frame 78 (C9ORF78), which plays a significant role in cellular processes such as chromosome segregation and alternative splicing. The C9ORF78 protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered structure, which facilitates its interaction with multiple spliceosomal components, including the spliceosome remodeling factor BRR2. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of alternative splicing, influencing exon skipping and splice site selection. Additionally, C9ORF78 localizes to kinetochores during cell division, contributing to the mitotic checkpoint and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. Furthermore, C9ORF78 has been implicated in cancer, serving as a tumor antigen in hepatocellular carcinoma and a marker for favorable outcomes in renal cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Koranne2021hC9ORF78; Bergfort2022A).

## Structure
The C9ORF78 protein is largely intrinsically disordered, lacking a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, which is a common trait among proteins involved in regulatory functions (Bergfort2022A). The N-terminal part of C9ORF78 binds to the spliceosome remodeling factor BRR2, with residues 5-58 running along the BRR2 CC in an extended conformation. Upon interaction, specific residues of C9ORF78 (14-18, 20-41, and 49-54) adopt α-helical structures, forming three helices (α1-α3) (Bergfort2022A). The central helix α2 contains five ER/K motifs, which are salt bridges that stabilize the helix and are common in spliceosomal proteins, suggesting that α2 is an important docking device on BRR2 (Bergfort2022A).

The interaction between C9ORF78 and BRR2 involves both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with 38 interface residues of C9ORF78 forming 40 hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with BRR2 (Bergfort2022A). The C-terminal residues of C9ORF78 are not visible in cryoEM structures, indicating a flexible and extended conformation, and these residues are highly conserved, suggesting functional importance (Bergfort2022A). The protein's intrinsically disordered nature and limited contacts to other domains suggest a lack of stable quaternary structure in isolation (Bergfort2022A).

## Function
C9orf78 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in chromosome segregation and alternative splicing. In healthy human cells, the C9ORF78 protein localizes to kinetochores, structures essential for the proper attachment of chromosomes to the spindle apparatus during cell division. This localization is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation, as the protein plays a role in the mitotic checkpoint, preventing anaphase onset until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle (Koranne2021hC9ORF78).

C9ORF78 is also involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process critical for generating protein diversity. It interacts with the spliceosome remodeling enzyme BRR2, influencing the selection of alternative 3′-splice sites and exon skipping events. This interaction is important for maintaining the balance of alternative splicing events, which is essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (Bergfort2022A). The protein's intrinsically disordered nature allows it to interact with multiple spliceosomal components, potentially affecting the kinetics of spliceosome assembly and transition between stages (Bergfort2022A). These roles highlight C9ORF78's importance in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression.

## Clinical Significance
C9ORF78 has been identified as a tumor antigen in hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer development (Bergfort2022A). It is also considered a marker for favorable clinical outcomes in renal cancer, suggesting its expression levels may correlate with disease prognosis (Bergfort2022A). The gene's role in alternative splicing, particularly its interaction with the spliceosome remodeling enzyme BRR2, is crucial for its function. Mutations in specific residues of C9ORF78, such as F8 and R41, can affect its binding to BRR2, leading to altered splicing outcomes (Bergfort2022A). These changes in splicing patterns could potentially contribute to disease pathogenesis, although the specific clinical implications of these mutations are not fully understood.

The study of C9ORF78's interactions with spliceosomal components, such as U5 snRNA and other proteins, suggests that disruptions in these interactions could have broader implications for splicing regulation and disease (Bergfort2022A). While the precise molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of C9ORF78 in disease remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cancer and splicing regulation highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Bergfort2022A).

## Interactions
C9ORF78 is involved in several interactions within the spliceosome, particularly with the BRR2 helicase. It was identified as a novel interactor of BRR2 through a yeast two-hybrid screen, and its interaction with BRR2 was confirmed in vitro and in HEK293T cells (Bergfort2022A). C9ORF78 interacts with the helicase region of BRR2, primarily through the CC region, with support from the NC region. This interaction is characterized by both hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts, involving numerous hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Bergfort2022A).

C9ORF78 also competes with FBP21 for binding to BRR2, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for spliceosome assembly. This competition affects the B-to-B act transition in the spliceosome, with C9ORF78 potentially remaining bound until the second step of splicing (Bergfort2022A). The protein interacts with other spliceosomal components, such as PRPF8 Jab1, EFTUD2, SNRNP40, and PRPF6, with its interaction significantly reduced when the R41 residue is altered (Bergfort2022A).

C9ORF78 also shows UV-crosslinking with U5 snRNA, indicating a direct interaction with U5 snRNP components, which supports its role in alternative splicing (Bergfort2022A). These interactions suggest that C9ORF78 modulates spliceosome transitions and splicing factor recruitment, influencing exon skipping and alternative splicing events (Bergfort2022A).
