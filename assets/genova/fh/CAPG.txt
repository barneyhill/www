# CAPG

## Overview
CAPG is a gene that encodes the capping actin protein, gelsolin-like, a member of the gelsolin superfamily known for its actin-binding properties. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further polymerization. Unlike other members of the gelsolin family, CAPG does not sever actin filaments, which distinguishes its function in cellular processes such as motility and shape regulation (Silacci2004Gelsolin). The activity of the CAPG protein is modulated by calcium ions and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and it undergoes various post-translational modifications that influence its interactions and function (Papala2017Isolation). CAPG is implicated in several cellular processes, including cell migration, phagocytosis, and potentially gene expression regulation, with its expression being linked to cancer progression and metastasis (Renz2008Invasive; De2004Increased).

## Structure
The CAPG protein, also known as macrophage-capping protein, is a member of the gelsolin superfamily and is characterized by its actin-binding capabilities. It consists of three gelsolin-like domains, which are homologous repeats found in the gelsolin superfamily proteins (Silacci2004Gelsolin). These domains contribute to its function as an actin filament capping protein, although CAPG lacks the ability to sever actin filaments, distinguishing it from other family members like gelsolin and adseverin (Silacci2004Gelsolin).

CAPG's activity is regulated by calcium ions (Ca2+) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), with Ca2+ binding inducing a conformational change that exposes the actin-binding site (Papala2017Isolation). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which may influence its conformation and interactions with binding partners (Papala2017Isolation). Tyrosine phosphorylation, in particular, might regulate Ca2+ sensitivity and increase PIP2 affinity, thereby decreasing actin-binding (Papala2017Isolation).

The N-terminus of CAPG is often acetylated or truncated, and truncation affects its phosphorylation status, with truncated forms not phosphorylated at certain residues (Papala2017Isolation). These modifications and structural features are conserved among eukaryotes, suggesting a critical role in CAPG's function (Papala2017Isolation).

## Function
CAPG, a member of the gelsolin superfamily, is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further polymerization. This activity is essential for controlling cell motility and shape, particularly in non-muscle cells (Renz2008Dynamics; Silacci2004Gelsolin). CAPG is distributed throughout the cell, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, although it lacks a nuclear export sequence, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus (Renz2008Dynamics).

In the cytoplasm, CAPG is involved in processes such as cell migration and phagocytosis, where it regulates actin-based cell motility and membrane ruffling (Renz2008Invasive; Silacci2004Gelsolin). In macrophages, CAPG is critical for membrane ruffling and phagocytosis, and its absence leads to defects in these processes (Renz2008Invasive). In endothelial cells, CAPG expression enhances motility and wound healing, indicating its role in actin filament assembly and cellular shape changes (Silacci2004Gelsolin).

The function of CAPG in the nucleus is less understood, but it is hypothesized to interact with DNA or transcriptional activators, potentially influencing gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Renz2008Dynamics; De2004Increased).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAPG gene, which encodes the capping actin protein, gelsolin like, have been implicated in the progression of various cancers. Overexpression of CAPG has been observed in breast and ovarian cancers, where it may contribute to tumor metastasis by influencing cell motility and invasion. This suggests that CAPG plays a role in the metastatic potential of cancer cells, potentially making it a target for therapeutic intervention in these malignancies.

Mutations or dysregulation of CAPG can disrupt normal actin filament dynamics, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function. Such disruptions may lead to enhanced invasive capabilities of cancer cells, facilitating their spread to other parts of the body. The link between CAPG expression and cancer progression highlights its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a possible target for developing anti-metastatic therapies.

Research into CAPG's role in cancer is ongoing, with studies aiming to better understand its mechanisms and interactions in tumor biology. This could provide insights into novel treatment strategies that specifically target the pathways involving CAPG to inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

## Interactions
CAPG, a member of the gelsolin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in actin filament dynamics and cellular processes. CAPG interacts with both the cytoplasmic (GDP-loaded) and nuclear (GTP-loaded) forms of Ran GTPase, which facilitates its transport to the nucleolus, suggesting a role in nucleolar functions and potentially influencing transcription processes (Hubert2008The). In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CAPG is associated with several regulatory protein complexes, including the chromatin-remodeling NSL complex, SNW1 complex, MLL1-WDR5 complex, and the WMM complex, indicating its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Ma2023Superenhancerassociated).

CAPG also interacts with actin and profilin, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It caps the barbed ends of actin filaments, preventing further polymerization, which is essential for regulating actin dynamics (Renz2008Dynamics). In breast cancer models, CAPG's interaction with actin is inhibited by llama-derived single-domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, which block its binding to actin monomers and filaments, thereby restraining cancer cell migration and invasion (Van2013A). These interactions highlight CAPG's significant role in cellular motility and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
