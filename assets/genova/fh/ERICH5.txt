# ERICH5

## Overview
ERICH5, or Glutamate Rich 5, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by its high glutamate content. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. As a non-enzymatic protein, Glutamate Rich 5 does not fall into categories such as kinases or receptors, but it may play a role in cellular signaling pathways or structural functions within the cell. Current research is focused on understanding its potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which may have implications for cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of ERICH5 and its encoded protein in human health and disease.
