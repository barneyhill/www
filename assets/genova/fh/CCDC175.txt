# CCDC175

## Overview
The CCDC175 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 175 protein, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs that are often involved in protein-protein interactions. Although the precise biological function of the CCDC175 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its structural features. Research has suggested that CCDC175 may play a role in modifying disease phenotypes, particularly in conditions such as cone-rod dystrophy and potentially in tumor development (Donato2022The; Mucha2023Identification). Additionally, genome-wide association studies have identified CCDC175 as having significant expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) associations with aortic traits, indicating its possible involvement in cardiovascular biology (Francis2022Genomewide). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional roles and clinical implications of the CCDC175 protein.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CCDC175 gene is still under investigation, with studies suggesting its potential involvement in various conditions. In the context of cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), a study identified a novel variant (c.76C>T) in the CCDC175 gene, which was found to have an extremely low frequency in the control group, indicating its potential role as a modifier gene influencing disease phenotypes (Donato2022The). The study highlights the complexity of CORD due to multigenic inheritance patterns and the presence of modifier genes like CCDC175, which contribute to phenotypic variability (Donato2022The).

In canine studies, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with the CCDC175 gene was linked to mammary gland tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumor development (Mucha2023Identification). Additionally, a genome-wide association study identified CCDC175 as having a significant expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) association with aortic traits in males, indicating a possible biological role in aortic conditions (Francis2022Genomewide).

While these findings suggest potential associations, the specific diseases or conditions directly linked to mutations or expression changes in CCDC175 in humans remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
