# GAL3ST3

## Overview
The GAL3ST3 gene encodes the enzyme galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 3, which is a member of the sulfotransferase family of enzymes. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids through the sulfation of galactose residues. Such modifications are critical for various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication, signal transduction, and molecular recognition. Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 3 is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, molecules that are essential for development and immune response. The enzyme's activity influences the structural and functional properties of glycoproteins and glycolipids, thereby affecting cellular interactions and signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
GAL3ST3 encodes the enzyme galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 3, which plays a critical role in the sulfation of galactose residues in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This post-translational modification is essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication, signal transduction, and molecular recognition. The enzyme is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. These sulfated molecules are important for numerous biological functions, such as development and immune response. By modifying glycoproteins and glycolipids, GAL3ST3 influences the structural and functional properties of these molecules, thereby impacting cellular interactions and signaling pathways. The activity of GAL3ST3 in the Golgi apparatus ensures the proper sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, which is crucial for maintaining normal physiological processes and organismal homeostasis.
