# DNAH7

## Overview
DNAH7 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 7, which is a critical component of the axonemal dynein complex. This protein belongs to the family of motor proteins known as dyneins, which are responsible for the movement of cilia and flagella. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 7 plays a pivotal role in the generation of force necessary for the beating of cilia and flagella, which is essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and sperm motility (Maiti2000Identification; Walton2023Axonemal). The protein is predominantly expressed in ciliated cells, particularly in the upper airways, underscoring its importance in respiratory health (Maiti2000Identification). Mutations in DNAH7 have been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder that affects ciliary function, leading to clinical manifestations such as chronic respiratory infections and, in some cases, Kartagener syndrome (Pereira2019Clinical).

## Function
DNAH7 encodes a protein that is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which is essential for the movement of cilia and flagella. This protein plays a critical role in generating the force required for ciliary and flagellar beating, which is vital for processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility (Maiti2000Identification). DNAH7 is particularly abundant in ciliated cells of the upper airways, indicating its significant role in respiratory ciliary function (Maiti2000Identification).

In humans, DNAH7 encodes the inner dynein arms IDAb and IDAe, which are involved in the structural organization of the axoneme, a central cytoskeletal structure shared by motile cilia and flagella (Walton2023Axonemal). These inner dynein arms interact with the DNALI1 homodimer and are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the axoneme, facilitating the sliding motion between microtubules that generates ciliary and flagellar movement (Wu2023DNALI1).

The protein's activity is primarily localized to ciliated tissues, where it contributes to the motility of cilia and flagella, essential for fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sperm motility (Maiti2000Identification). DNAH7's function is crucial for maintaining normal respiratory and reproductive health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH7 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections and other ciliary dysfunctions. In particular, DNAH7 variants have been linked to Kartagener syndrome, a form of PCD that includes situs inversus and respiratory issues. Studies have identified specific mutations, such as p.Gly2737Ser and p.Arg3983Trp, which are predicted to be disease-causing and affect critical regions of the dynein motor domain, impacting microtubule binding and protein stability (Pereira2019Clinical). These mutations result in the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in cilia, leading to impaired ciliary motility and function (Pereira2019Clinical).

Alterations in DNAH7 expression levels have also been observed, with significant decreases in mRNA levels in affected individuals, suggesting a negative impact on gene expression (Pereira2019Clinical). Improper localization of the DNAH7 protein, accumulating in the cytoplasm rather than along the ciliary axoneme, further contributes to the pathogenicity of these variants (Pereira2019Clinical). The interaction of DNAH7 with other gene variants, such as DNAH5, may exacerbate the clinical phenotype, highlighting the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in PCD (Pereira2019Clinical).

## Interactions
DNAH7 is a component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) family, which plays a crucial role in ciliary motility. It is associated with DNALI1 and is part of the IDA b and e complexes (Wilken2024Primary). In healthy individuals, DNAH7 is localized throughout the entire length of ciliary axonemes, as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (Wilken2024Primary). However, in individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) due to variants in the CCDC39 or CCDC40 genes, DNAH7 is absent from the ciliary axoneme, indicating its dependency on these proteins for proper localization (Wilken2024Primary).

The DNAH7 protein interacts with microtubules through its microtubule-binding site (MTBS), which is crucial for its function in dynein motor activity. Mutations in this site, such as the p.Gly2737Ser variant, can disrupt protein stability and reduce dynein's affinity for microtubules, affecting its function (Pereira2019Clinical). The study of DNAH7 in the context of Kartagener syndrome suggests that improper localization and reduced expression of DNAH7 can contribute to the disease phenotype, highlighting the importance of its interactions within the dynein complex (Pereira2019Clinical).
