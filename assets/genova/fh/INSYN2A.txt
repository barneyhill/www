# INSYN2A

## Overview
INSYN2A is a gene that encodes the protein inhibitory synaptic factor 2A, which is integral to the modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission within the nervous system. This protein is categorized as a component of the inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD) and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals, crucial for proper neural circuit function and overall brain activity. INSYN2A influences neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, thereby affecting neural communication and cognitive processes (Cherik2021Further). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in developmental brain disorders and its potential contribution to conditions such as 10q26 microdeletion syndrome and placental mesenchymal dysplasia (Soejima2022Placental). Research has highlighted its interactions with other synaptic proteins, such as gephyrin, and its role in maintaining inhibitory synaptic function, which may have implications for neurological disorders like epilepsy (Uezu2016Identification).

## Structure


## Function
INSYN2A, also known as inhibitory synaptic factor 2A, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic function, particularly in modulating inhibitory synaptic transmission. This modulation is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition within the nervous system, which is vital for proper neural circuit function and overall brain activity. The protein is active at synapses, where it influences neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, thereby impacting neural communication and cognitive processes (Cherik2021Further).

In the context of developmental brain disorders, INSYN2A is part of a protein complex that regulates postsynaptic inhibition in the newborn mouse brain, suggesting its potential involvement in similar processes in humans. The gene has a high probability of being haploinsufficient, with a pLI score of 0.91, indicating its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function and cognitive development (Cherik2021Further). The involvement of INSYN2A in these molecular processes underscores its significance in the development and function of the nervous system, and disruptions in its activity may contribute to cognitive phenotypes associated with chromosomal deletions, such as those observed in 10q26 microdeletion syndrome (Cherik2021Further).

## Clinical Significance
INSYN2A has been implicated in various neurological conditions due to its role in synaptic function. Alterations in the expression or function of INSYN2A may contribute to developmental brain disorders. The gene is part of a protein complex that regulates postsynaptic inhibition, and its high probability of being haploinsufficient suggests that a single non-functional copy could lead to disease (Cherik2021Further). Although specific diseases directly linked to INSYN2A mutations are not fully established, its involvement in cognitive functions and potential contribution to developmental brain disorders is suggested (Cherik2021Further).

Research has shown that INSYN2A, along with other proteins, is crucial for maintaining inhibitory synaptic activity. Disruption of this function can lead to increased neuronal excitability and conditions such as epilepsy (Uezu2016Identification). The gene's role in inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD) and its association with proteins involved in seizure susceptibility further highlight its clinical significance (Uezu2016Identification).

Additionally, INSYN2A has been associated with placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD) through aberrant hypomethylation, indicating a potential role in this condition (Soejima2022Placental). However, its involvement in other diseases remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
INSYN2A, also known as inhibitory synaptic factor 2A, is a protein that participates in several interactions within the inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD). It has been identified as a novel component of the iPSD through a study using the iBioID method, which involves biotin labeling and mass spectrometry for protein identification. INSYN2A was found to co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with gephyrin, a known marker of the iPSD, suggesting a physical interaction between these proteins (Uezu2016Identification). This interaction indicates that INSYN2A may play a role in the structural or functional organization of inhibitory synapses.

The study also demonstrated that the depletion of INSYN2A led to specific changes in synaptic function, such as an increase in the inter-event intervals of GABA A receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), without affecting their amplitude. This suggests that INSYN2A is involved in maintaining normal inhibitory synaptic function (Uezu2016Identification). These findings highlight the importance of INSYN2A in synaptic inhibition and its potential involvement in neurological disorders, as it is part of a complex that regulates postsynaptic inhibition in the brain (Cherik2021Further).
