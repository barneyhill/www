# IGFL1

## Overview
IGFL1, or insulin growth factor-like family member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family. This family is known for its involvement in cellular growth, development, and survival. The IGFL1 protein is characterized by its structural similarity to other IGF family members, which are typically involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. IGFL1 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including skin inflammation and cancer. It interacts with the receptor IGFLR1, which shares structural features with the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, suggesting a role in immune response modulation and inflammation (Lobito2011Murine). The gene's expression is notably altered in conditions such as psoriasis and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with disease progression and prognosis (Wang2021Elevated).

## Clinical Significance
IGFL1 (IGF like family member 1) is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, IGFL1 is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is observed in psoriatic skin samples and is induced in cultured primary keratinocytes by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Lobito2011Murine). IGFL1 interacts with the receptor IGFLR1, which is structurally similar to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, indicating its potential involvement in T cell biology and skin inflammation (Lobito2011Murine).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), IGFL1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its elevated expression promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, contributing to tumor progression. The gene's overexpression correlates with advanced pathological stages and poor overall survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for LUAD (Wang2021Elevated). The upregulation of IGFL1 in LUAD is partly attributed to promoter hypomethylation (Wang2021Elevated). IGFL1 is also overexpressed in other cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, suggesting a broader role in cancer development (Wang2021Elevated).
