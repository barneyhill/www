# ADTRP

## Overview
The ADTRP gene encodes the androgen-dependent TFPI-regulating protein, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in vascular biology and lipid metabolism. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and is primarily expressed in endothelial cells, where it regulates the activity of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a key component in maintaining hemostatic balance. ADTRP's function is modulated by androgens, which enhance its expression and, consequently, the anticoagulant activity of TFPI. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as Caveolin-1 and transcription factors, underscore its involvement in cellular signaling pathways. Clinically, variations in the ADTRP gene have been associated with cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Lupu2021Insights; Luo2016Coronary; Lupu2011Novel).

## Structure
The ADTRP protein, encoded by the C6ORF105 gene, is a member of the androgen-inducible gene family. Its canonical isoform consists of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa (Lupu2021Insights). The protein features six predicted transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function as a membrane protein (Lupu2021Insights). Specific sites for FAHFA hydrolase activity are located at threonine (T47) and histidine (H131) residues, which are crucial for its enzymatic function (Parsons2016AIG1).

ADTRP undergoes several post-translational modifications, including potential palmitoylation at cysteine residues C7 and C62, which may influence its localization in lipid rafts (Lupu2021Insights). Phosphorylation occurs at serine residues S148 and S151, threonine residues T61, T70, and T80, and tyrosine residues Y58 and Y201 (Lupu2021Insights). These modifications can affect the protein's stability and function.

The protein is expressed in various human tissues, including endothelial cells, placenta, and several cell lines, with expression levels changing throughout development and aging (Lupu2021Insights). Despite its transmembrane nature, soluble forms of ADTRP have been detected in human plasma (Lupu2021Insights). The protein's structure and modifications suggest a complex role in lipid metabolism and vascular biology.

## Function
The ADTRP gene encodes the androgen-dependent TFPI-regulating protein, which plays a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression, proliferation, and apoptosis in human cells. ADTRP influences the expression of several histone genes and key cell cycle genes such as CCND1 (cyclin D1), CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), and CDKN1A (p21 CIP). Knockdown of ADTRP reduces the expression of these genes, while overexpression increases it, affecting the cell cycle, particularly the S phase, and influencing cell proliferation (Luo2016Coronary).

ADTRP is also involved in the regulation of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in endothelial cells. It enhances TFPI expression and activity, which is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance by inhibiting coagulation factor Xa (FXa). ADTRP's activity is androgen-responsive, and its expression can be induced by androgens like dihydrotestosterone, which increases TFPI's anticoagulant capabilities (Lupu2011Novel).

ADTRP is a cell membrane protein with six transmembrane domains, colocalizing with TFPI and CAV1 in lipid rafts, suggesting a role in cellular signaling and the regulation of downstream genes and proteins (Luo2016Coronary; Lupu2011Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADTRP gene have been linked to several cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Genome-wide association studies have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6903956 in the ADTRP gene, which is associated with an increased risk of CAD and MI. This SNP is linked to decreased expression of ADTRP, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Lupu2021Insights; Luo2016Coronary). 

ADTRP's role in regulating the Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is crucial for maintaining coagulation balance. Alterations in ADTRP expression can lead to increased coagulation and thrombosis risk, as seen in conditions like deep vein thrombosis and venous thromboembolism (Lupu2021Insights; Patel2018Role). 

In addition to its role in coagulation, ADTRP is involved in vascular development and function. Deficiency in ADTRP can result in vascular abnormalities, such as leaky vessels and hemorrhage, due to defective endothelial cell junctions and extracellular matrix degradation. These defects are linked to abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which may contribute to vascular diseases (Lupu2021Insights; Patel2018Role). 

The gene's expression is also influenced by androgen levels, with low androgen levels being associated with increased CAD and MI risks. Androgen's protective effects against atherosclerosis may be mediated through the upregulation of ADTRP, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Luo2017Androgen).

## Interactions
ADTRP (androgen-dependent TFPI regulating protein) is known to physically interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of endothelial cells. It colocalizes with Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) and Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in lipid rafts or caveolae, which are specialized membrane domains. This colocalization is significant, with over 85% of TFPI colocalizing with Cav-1, indicating a strong association between these proteins (Lupu2011Novel). ADTRP's interaction with TFPI is crucial for maintaining the anticoagulant potential of TFPI on the cell surface, as it enhances TFPI's inhibitory function on FXa generation (Lupu2011Novel).

ADTRP also interacts with the transcription factor POU1F1, which binds to a specific response element in the TFPI promoter region. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional regulation of TFPI, as deletion of the POU1F1 binding site abolishes ADTRP-mediated transcription of TFPI (Lupu2021Insights; Luo2020ADTRP). The protein's localization in lipid rafts is important for its function, as a palmitoylation-deficient ADTRP mutant fails to increase TFPI anticoagulant activity, suggesting that palmitoylation supports its membrane localization and function as a lipid raft domain organizer (Lupu2021Insights).
