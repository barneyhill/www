# PPP2R3C

## Overview
The PPP2R3C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B''gamma, a regulatory component of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in a variety of cellular processes. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining centrosome function by modulating the activity of centriolar proteins, such as MAP3K1, and is essential for processes like microtubule nucleation and cilium formation (Ganga2024A). The PPP2R3C protein is localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and development. It interacts with other centriolar proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for centrosome integrity and function (Ganga2024A). Mutations in the PPP2R3C gene have been linked to congenital disorders, including syndromic 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis, and are implicated in certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Ganga2024Aa; Zhang2022Case).

## Function
The PPP2R3C gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. PPP2R3C is involved in maintaining centrosome function by counteracting the kinase activity of MAP3K1, a centriolar protein. This balance is essential for processes such as microtubule nucleation, cilium formation, and centriole structural integrity (Ganga2024A). PPP2R3C localizes to the mother and daughter centrioles, with a distribution pattern similar to other centriolar proteins like FOP and CEP350, indicating its role in centrosome and cilia-related processes (Ganga2024A).

In the context of cell proliferation, PPP2R3C functions as a phosphatase that opposes MAP3K1 activity, which is involved in JNK signaling pathways. Knockout studies in cell lines have shown that the absence of PPP2R3C impairs cell proliferation, which can be rescued by knocking out MAP3K1, highlighting its regulatory role (Ganga2024A). PPP2R3C is also part of a phosphoregulatory module that is vital for proper centrosome function, and its dysfunction is linked to congenital syndromes such as gonadal dysgenesis (Ganga2024A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP2R3C gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably syndromic 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by a mismatch between chromosomal and gonadal sex, leading to female external genitalia in individuals with an XY karyotype, along with other systemic anomalies such as facial deformities, skeletal and muscle abnormalities, and impaired nervous system function (Vaneynde2022The; Zhang2022Case). Specific pathogenic variants, such as L193S, F350S, and L103P, have been linked to myoectodermal gonadal dysgenesis (MEGD), which includes symptoms like complete gonadal dysgenesis, facial dysmorphism, and retinal degeneration (Ganga2024Aa).

The PPP2R3C gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is crucial for centrosome function. Mutations in PPP2R3C can impair its centriolar localization and binding to proteins like FOP, leading to centrosome dysfunction. This dysfunction is implicated in both gonadal dysgenesis and certain cancers, such as neuroblastomas and B-cell leukemias, where high MAP3K1 expression and PPP2R3C dependence are observed (Ganga2024A; Ganga2024Aa). The balance between PPP2R3C and MAP3K1 activities is essential, as imbalances can lead to cell proliferation issues and centrosome-related pathologies (Ganga2024A).

## Interactions
PPP2R3C, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with centriolar proteins such as FOP (FGFR1OP/CEP43) and CEP350, forming a complex that is essential for centrosome function. This interaction is important for counteracting MAP3K1 signaling, which is involved in cell growth and centrosome regulation (Ganga2024A). PPP2R3C's localization to centrioles is dependent on FOP, as its presence at centrioles is lost in FOP knockout cells, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins (Ganga2024A).

PPP2R3C also forms a complex with PP5, another protein phosphatase, to regulate the phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1). This complex dephosphorylates P-gp at sites phosphorylated by PKA and PKC, affecting P-gp's expression and function, which is significant in the context of drug resistance in cancer cells (Katayama2014Protein). The interaction between PPP2R3C and PP5 is necessary for the binding to P-gp, as demonstrated by co-precipitation experiments (Katayama2014Protein). These interactions highlight PPP2R3C's role in various cellular processes through its involvement in multiprotein complexes.
