# ITPA

## Overview
The ITPA gene encodes the enzyme inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase), a crucial member of the Nudix hydrolase family. This enzyme is responsible for hydrolyzing non-canonical purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as inosine triphosphate (ITP) and xanthosine triphosphate (XTP), into their respective monophosphates, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially mutagenic nucleotides within the cell (Lin2001Cloning; Simone2013ITPA). ITPase functions as a homodimeric protein, with each monomer contributing to the active site, and is characterized by a conserved Nudix hydrolase domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Simone2013The; Houndonougbo2020Structural). The enzyme plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by protecting DNA from the incorporation of modified purine bases, thus preventing mutations and chromosomal aberrations (Menezes2012Pivotal). Variations in the ITPA gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including adverse drug reactions and genetic disorders, highlighting its significance in pharmacogenetics and disease pathogenesis (Zamzami2022Inosine; Burgis2016A).

## Structure
The human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) protein is a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of two lobes composed of beta sheets and alpha helical segments (Houndonougbo2020Structural). The primary structure of ITPA includes a sequence of 194 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 21,501 Da (Lin2001Cloning). The secondary structure is characterized by a central β-sheet forming the floor of the active site, flanked by two mainly α-helical lobes (Simone2013The). The tertiary structure is impacted by mutations such as P32T, which causes the hydrophobic side chain of Phe31 to flip out into the solvent, creating a cavity in the hydrophobic core and destabilizing the protein (Simone2013The). Despite these changes, the quaternary structure remains as a homodimer, with the dimer interface involving extensive hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Simone2013The).

The ITPA protein contains a conserved Nudix hydrolase domain, essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in hydrolyzing noncanonical purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as inosine triphosphate (ITP) and xanthosine triphosphate (XTP), to their respective monophosphates (Lin2001Cloning). The protein's activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its stability and function.

## Function
The ITPA gene encodes the enzyme inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase), which plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleotide pool balance in human cells. This enzyme hydrolyzes non-canonical nucleotides such as inosine triphosphate (ITP) and deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) into their respective monophosphates, inosine monophosphate (IMP) and deoxyinosine monophosphate (dIMP), along with inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) (Lin2001Cloning; Simone2013ITPA). By preventing the accumulation of these potentially mutagenic nucleotides, ITPase protects DNA from the incorporation of modified purine bases, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Lin2001Cloning; Menezes2012Pivotal).

ITPase is active in the cytoplasm and requires divalent cations such as Mg2+ for its enzymatic activity, operating optimally at an alkaline pH (Lin2001Cloning; Simone2013ITPA). The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the active site, which undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding (Simone2013ITPA). The activity of ITPase is essential for preventing the incorporation of non-canonical nucleotides into DNA and RNA, which could lead to mutations and chromosomal aberrations (Lin2001Cloning; Simone2013ITPA). This protective role is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing apoptosis, which can contribute to degenerative diseases and cancer if unchecked (Menezes2012Pivotal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the ITPA gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions. One significant condition is the impact of ITPA variations on hepatitis C treatment outcomes. Variations can lead to nucleotide pool imbalances, affecting the viral genome and potentially reducing viral load through an immune response (Burgis2016A). ITPA mutations are also linked to infantile encephalopathy, characterized by severe developmental issues, microcephaly, and early death in infants. These mutations result in altered protein structure and function, particularly affecting brain and cardiac tissues (Zamzami2022Inosine; Burgis2016A).

ITPA polymorphisms are associated with increased susceptibility to young-onset tuberculosis, possibly due to altered expression levels affecting the immune response (Burgis2016A). The c.94C > A (p.Pro32Thr) variant is notable for its impact on protein stability and catalytic activity, leading to adverse drug reactions in azathioprine-treated patients and mitochondrial DNA defects in adult hematological malignancy patients (Zamzami2022Inosine; Zamzami2013Inosine). ITPA deficiency has been linked to adverse drug reactions, particularly with thiopurine medications, and is considered an important pharmacogenetic phenotype affecting drug reactions (Simone2013ITPA).
