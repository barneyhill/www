# MUCL1

## Overview
MUCL1 (mucin-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including melanogenesis and immune regulation. The protein, also referred to as mucin-like 1, is characterized by its mucin-like properties, which are crucial for its role in cellular homeostasis and the integrity of the mucus barrier. MUCL1 is notably expressed in skin cells, where it negatively regulates melanin production and tyrosinase activity, thus influencing pigmentation levels (Kim2021The). Beyond its role in pigmentation, MUCL1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in breast cancer cells, affecting cell proliferation pathways (Conley2016HER2). Additionally, MUCL1 serves as a biomarker in immune-related contexts, such as in vitamin D3-induced tolerogenic dendritic cells in multiple sclerosis patients, suggesting its involvement in immune modulation (NavarroBarriuso2019MAP7). These diverse functions underscore the gene's significance in both physiological and pathological processes.

## Structure


## Function
MUCL1 (mucin-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of melanogenesis, the process of melanin production in human cells. MUCL1 is highly expressed in skin cells and shows a negative correlation with melanin deposition, suggesting its role in controlling pigmentation levels. The protein is involved in the melanogenic pathway, where its expression inversely affects melanin levels and tyrosinase activity, a key enzyme in melanin synthesis. When MUCL1 is silenced, melanin levels and tyrosinase activity increase, indicating that MUCL1 negatively regulates these processes (Kim2021The).

MUCL1's function is influenced by threonine, an amino acid that modulates its expression. Threonine supplementation can reverse the effects of MUCL1 silencing, reducing melanin accumulation and tyrosinase activity. This suggests that threonine specifically influences MUCL1's role in melanogenesis (Kim2021The). Additionally, MUCL1 is involved in autophagy-related FoxO signaling, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and the integrity of the mucus barrier (Kim2021The). These findings highlight MUCL1's significant role in skin pigmentation and cellular processes related to mucin production.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MUCL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, MUCL1 is highly expressed in HER2-amplified tumors and is regulated by the phosphoinositide3-kinase/Akt pathway downstream of HER2. This overexpression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes. Knockdown of MUCL1 in breast cancer cells leads to cell cycle arrest and changes in the levels of cyclins and cell cycle inhibitors, indicating its role in promoting cell proliferation and survival in HER2-overexpressing cells (Conley2016HER2).

In melanoma, MUCL1 expression is negatively correlated with melanin deposition. Threonine supplementation can modulate MUCL1 levels, affecting melanogenesis and reducing metastasis-related gene expression. This suggests MUCL1's potential as a target for therapeutic strategies in melanoma, where it may influence pigmentation and metastatic potential (Kim2021The).

MUCL1 has also been identified as a biomarker in the context of vitamin D3-induced tolerogenic dendritic cells in multiple sclerosis patients, indicating its potential role in immune modulation (NavarroBarriuso2019MAP7).

## Interactions
MUCL1, a protein encoded by the MUCL1 gene, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of breast cancer, MUCL1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a protein often overexpressed in breast cancers. This interaction is significant as it influences FAK's phosphorylation and activation, which subsequently activates the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, promoting cell cycle progression and proliferation in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (Conley2016HER2). The interaction between MUCL1 and FAK is crucial for the proliferation of these cancer cells, as evidenced by the effects of MUCL1 knockdown, which mimic the inhibition of FAK (Conley2016HER2).

In addition to its role in cancer, MUCL1 is identified as a biomarker in vitamin D3-induced tolerogenic dendritic cells (vitD3-tolDC) in multiple sclerosis patients. Although the specific interactions of MUCL1 in this context are not fully detailed, it is noted to be part of a network of protein interactions related to immune-related mechanisms (NavarroBarriuso2019MAP7). These interactions suggest a potential role for MUCL1 in immune regulation, although further studies are needed to elucidate its precise functions in this setting.
