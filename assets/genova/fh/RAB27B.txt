# RAB27B

## Overview
RAB27B is a gene that encodes the RAB27B protein, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating vesicle trafficking within cells. The RAB27B protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, and is involved in the docking and recruitment of secretory granules to the plasma membrane, facilitating exocytosis in various exocytic cells (Chavas2007Structure; Gomi2007Rab27b). It shares significant sequence identity with Rab27a and is characterized by a domain-swapped dimer configuration in its GDP-bound form (Chavas2007Structure). RAB27B plays a crucial role in processes such as proplatelet formation and exosome secretion, impacting cellular communication and homeostasis (Hendrix2012An; Ostrowski2009Rab27a). Additionally, alterations in RAB27B expression have been linked to cancer progression, making it a potential biomarker for certain cancer types (Zhang2012Overexpression; Hendrix2010Effect).

## Structure
The RAB27B protein is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are involved in vesicle trafficking. The primary structure of RAB27B shares 70% sequence identity with Rab27a, another member of the Rab27 subfamily (Chavas2007Structure). The secondary structure of RAB27B includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as is typical for proteins in this family. The tertiary structure of RAB27B, as revealed by crystallographic studies, shows an unexpected domain-swapped dimer configuration in the GDP-bound form. This involves the formation of an antiparallel intermolecular β-sheet between the long β2 strands from each monomer, with the switch I region forming part of this β2 strand (Chavas2007Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, RAB27B forms a domain-swapped dimer in crystal structures, although it exists as a monomer in solution, as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering and size-exclusion chromatography (Chavas2007Structure). The protein contains GTPase domains, which are crucial for its function as a molecular switch cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states (Chavas2007Structure). Post-translational modifications such as prenylation are common in Rab proteins, although specific modifications for RAB27B are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond in some structures suggests a potential regulatory mechanism under oxidative stress (Chavas2007Structure).

## Function
RAB27B is a member of the Rab GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking. In healthy human cells, RAB27B is involved in the delivery of secretory granules near the plasma membrane, a process essential for exocytosis. This protein is expressed in a variety of exocytic cells, including those in the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and hematopoietic system, where it facilitates the secretion of substances like digestive enzymes, mucus, and surfactants (Hendrix2012An; Gomi2007Rab27b).

RAB27B is particularly important in the docking and recruitment of secretory granules, such as ACTH granules in corticotrophs, to the plasma membrane. This function is critical for the polarized distribution of granules, ensuring their proper localization and secretion (Gomi2007Rab27b). In the hematopoietic system, RAB27B is involved in proplatelet formation and dense granule transport in megakaryocytes and platelets, which are vital for platelet activation and thrombus formation (Hendrix2012An).

Additionally, RAB27B is implicated in the exosome secretion pathway, where it regulates the docking of multivesicular endosomes to the plasma membrane, stabilizing their position and controlling their movement within the cell (Ostrowski2009Rab27a). This role is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating intercellular communication (Ostrowski2009Rab27a).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB27B gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In breast cancer, RAB27B overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth, invasiveness, and lymph node metastasis, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive tumors. This overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and lower survival rates, making RAB27B a potential biomarker for breast cancer progression (Zhang2012Overexpression; Hendrix2010Effect). 

In prostate cancer, RAB27B is underexpressed in metastatic tissues, and its expression is inversely correlated with biochemical recurrence-free survival. This suggests that lower levels of RAB27B may be linked to more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes (Worst2017RAB27A).

RAB27B is also implicated in renal cell carcinoma, where its high expression is associated with sunitinib resistance and lower overall survival rates. Knockdown of RAB27B in these cells reduces proliferation, indicating its role in oncogenic processes and drug resistance (Tsuruda2020Oncogenic).

Overall, RAB27B's role in exosome secretion and its interactions with other cellular pathways contribute to its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis across various cancer types (Yong2021Cancerdriving; Li2018Functional).

## Interactions
Rab27B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate vesicle trafficking and secretion processes. It interacts with several effector proteins, primarily in its GTP-bound state, to exert its functions. Rab27B is known to form complexes with Synaptotagmin-like protein 1 (Slp1) and CRMP-2, which are involved in the anterograde transport of TrkB-containing vesicles (Arias‐Hervert2020Actions). It also shares effectors with Rab3 GTPases, such as Synaptotagmin-like proteins, but has specific effectors like Slp4A, Rabphilin, and Noc2 (Arias‐Hervert2020Actions).

Rab27B interacts with proteins like V-ATPase and HSP90α, which are associated with cancer progression, highlighting its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Li2018Functional). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, Rab27B is involved in the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, interacting with proteins such as LC3 and LAMP1, which are markers of autophagosomes and lysosomes (Underwood2020Rab27b). These interactions suggest Rab27B's involvement in the regulation of protein secretion and clearance, impacting processes like synaptic transmission and cellular secretion.
