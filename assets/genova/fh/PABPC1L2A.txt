# PABPC1L2A

## Overview
The PABPC1L2A gene encodes the neuPABP protein, a neural-specific poly(A) binding protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of RNA metabolism within the nervous system. Unlike other poly(A) binding proteins, neuPABP is characterized by its unique interactions with brain-specific non-coding RNAs and mRNAs, which are involved in translational repression. This protein is distinct in its inability to bind certain translation initiation factors, such as eIF4G, highlighting its specialized function in repressing translation (Sharma2023Uncovering). NeuPABP's localization in neuronal soma and dendrites, along with its interaction with PURα, suggests a role in RNA transport and localization, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis, processes vital for cognitive functions like learning and memory (Sharma2023Uncovering).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The PABPC1L2A gene encodes the neuPABP protein, a neural-specific poly(A) binding protein with unique properties. NeuPABP interacts with specific RNA populations, including brain-specific non-coding RNAs such as BC1 and BC200, and mRNAs coding for ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins. These interactions suggest a role in translational repression, as neuPABP associates with translationally dormant RNAs (Sharma2023Uncovering).

NeuPABP binds poly(A) RNA with an affinity similar to PABPC1 but does not bind PAIP2, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism. It also lacks the ability to bind eIF4G, a factor involved in translation initiation, which further supports its role in repressing translation (Sharma2023Uncovering).

NeuPABP colocalizes with PURα in neuronal soma and dendrites, suggesting a potential role in RNA transport and localization within neurons. This interaction may be significant for synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis, crucial for learning and memory (Sharma2023Uncovering). The protein's unique N-terminal domain, initiated by a GUG codon, may facilitate specific interactions that are distinct from other poly(A) binding proteins (Sharma2023Uncovering).
