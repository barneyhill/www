# UBE2V2

## Overview
UBE2V2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2, a critical component in the ubiquitination pathway, which is essential for protein regulation and cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by UBE2V2 is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) and cellular signaling, primarily through its role in forming K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in conjunction with UBE2N. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by modulating protein ubiquitination in response to DNA damage. UBE2V2's activity is crucial for the regulation of DNA repair and cell cycle processes, and it is implicated in various cancers due to its involvement in these pathways (Zhao2018Ube2V2; Wang2023A).

## Function
UBE2V2 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in DNA damage response (DDR) and cellular signaling. It functions by forming a heterodimer with UBE2N, facilitating K63-linked polyubiquitin chain formation, which is essential for signaling pathways involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Zhao2018Ube2V2). UBE2V2 is particularly important in maintaining genomic stability by modulating protein ubiquitination in response to DNA damage (Zhao2018Ube2V2).

The protein acts as a sensor for reactive electrophilic species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), through a conserved cysteine residue (C69). This modification, known as HNEylation, enhances UBE2V2's interaction with UBE2N and other DDR proteins, promoting ubiquitination of targets like MCM6 and PCNA, which are vital for DNA replication and repair (Zhao2018Ube2V2). UBE2V2's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it coordinates responses to oxidative stress and DNA damage, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis (Zhao2018Ube2V2). Through these interactions and modifications, UBE2V2 plays a significant role in the fine-tuning of cellular responses to maintain genome integrity (Zhao2018Ube2V2).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2V2, also known as MMS2, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in ubiquitination, a process crucial for protein degradation and cellular regulation. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and other cancers, UBE2V2 is frequently found with gain mutations, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Wang2023A). In prostate cancer, UBE2V2 protein levels are upregulated, promoting cell proliferation. This upregulation is regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-499a, which binds to the 3′-UTR of UBE2V2, highlighting its role in cancer pathogenesis (Chen2021miR499a).

UBE2V2 is also overexpressed in certain subtypes of ependymoma, a type of brain tumor, where it contributes to DNA damage response by ubiquitinating Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), essential for DNA replication and repair (Vriend2022Ubiquitin). Despite its involvement in these processes, specific clinical significance regarding UBE2V2 mutations or their direct association with diseases beyond these cancers is not extensively detailed in the available literature. However, its role in DNA damage repair and cell proliferation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Wijk2009The).

## Interactions
UBE2V2, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2, participates in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in cellular processes. UBE2V2 forms a heterodimer with UBE2N, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which is crucial for DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. This interaction is enhanced by the specific post-translational modification of UBE2V2 known as HNEylation, which involves the addition of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) to the C69 residue of UBE2V2. This modification increases UBE2V2's ability to promote K63-linked ubiquitin chain formation, a process important for DDR and NF-κB inflammatory signaling (Zhao2018Ube2V2).

UBE2V2 also interacts with other proteins involved in DDR, such as p53 and H2A, and regulates the ubiquitination of MCM6 and PCNA, which are associated with DNA replication and repair. The interaction with UBE2N is particularly significant, as it stimulates UBE2N's enzymatic activity, leading to increased ubiquitination of DDR proteins and potentially causing DNA replication fork stalling (Zhao2018Ube2V2). These interactions highlight UBE2V2's role in coordinating DDR through its interactions and modifications, bridging redox and ubiquitin signaling pathways (Zhao2018Ube2V2).
