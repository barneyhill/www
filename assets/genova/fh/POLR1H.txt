# POLR1H

## Overview
The POLR1H gene encodes the RNA polymerase I subunit H, a component of the RNA polymerase I complex, which is primarily responsible for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. This protein plays a crucial role in the synthesis of rRNA, a key component of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. As a subunit of RNA polymerase I, POLR1H is involved in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth. Mutations or dysregulation of POLR1H can have significant implications for cellular function and have been associated with various diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular physiology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
