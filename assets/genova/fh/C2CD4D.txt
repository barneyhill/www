# C2CD4D

## Overview
C2CD4D is a gene that encodes the protein C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 4D, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a C2 domain, which is known to mediate calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, suggesting a role in intracellular signaling pathways. While the specific functions of the C2CD4D protein are not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a calcium-binding protein, potentially involved in cellular signaling and regulation. The gene has garnered attention in cancer research due to its altered expression and methylation patterns in several cancers, including ovarian and breast cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection and its involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Matsas2023Tumor; Wever2023Molecular; Dastsooz2024Involvement).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C2CD4D has been implicated in various cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. Alterations in the methylation levels of C2CD4D have been associated with ovarian cancer detection. Studies have shown that C2CD4D methylation is significantly elevated in the urine of ovarian cancer patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection (Wever2023Molecular). This gene's methylation patterns have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing early-stage ovarian cancer from healthy individuals, highlighting its diagnostic potential (Matsas2023Tumor).

In addition to ovarian cancer, C2CD4D has been noted in breast cancer research. It is identified as one of the upregulated genes in breast cancer, although specific details about its role or association with the disease are not extensively covered (Dastsooz2024Involvement). The gene has also been mentioned in the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, where frameshift mutations in C2CD4D were observed, particularly in liver metastasis groups undergoing regular treatment (Wang2021Wholeexome).

Overall, the clinical significance of C2CD4D lies in its potential as a biomarker for cancer detection and its involvement in cancer pathogenesis through alterations in its methylation and expression levels.
