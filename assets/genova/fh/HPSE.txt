# HPSE

## Overview
The HPSE gene encodes the enzyme heparanase, a glycosyl hydrolase that plays a pivotal role in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a major component of the extracellular matrix. Heparanase is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to become an active enzyme, which functions as a non-covalent heterodimer. This enzyme is crucial for various physiological processes, including tissue remodeling, cell migration, and angiogenesis, by modulating the extracellular matrix and releasing growth factors. Beyond its enzymatic activity, heparanase also participates in intracellular signaling pathways, influencing cell adhesion and invasion. The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Yuan2022Heparanase; Shu2019Heparanase).

## Structure
The heparanase (HPSE) protein is initially synthesized as a 68 kDa preproenzyme, which includes a signal sequence from Met1 to Ala35. This sequence is cleaved to form an inactive 65 kDa proHPSE, which is further processed by cathepsin L into an active enzyme. The active form is a non-covalent heterodimer consisting of an 8 kDa N-terminal subunit (Gln36-Glu109) and a 50 kDa C-terminal subunit (Lys159-Ile543) (Wu2015Structural; Yuan2022Heparanase).

The tertiary structure of HPSE includes a (β/α)8-TIM barrel domain, which is a key structural feature, and a smaller β-sandwich domain. The β-sandwich domain is involved in secretion, activation, cellular trafficking, and enzymatic activities (Wu2015Structural; Yuan2022Heparanase). The 50 kDa subunit contains six putative N-glycosylation sites, with N-linked GlcNAc residues observed at five of these sites, which regulate HPSE secretion and transport (Wu2015Structural; Yuan2022Heparanase).

HPSE belongs to the GH79 family of β-glucuronidases and shares structural similarities with bacterial GH79s, although it has distinct substrate recognition features due to variations in the substrate binding canyon (Wu2015Structural; Yuan2022Heparanase). The enzyme's catalytic activity is facilitated by a binding groove containing conserved residues Glu343 and Glu225, essential for its function (Wu2015Structural; Yuan2022Heparanase).

## Function
Heparanase (HPSE) is a crucial enzyme in healthy human cells, primarily involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide. This enzymatic activity is essential for the catabolic processing of internalized HS proteoglycans within lysosomes and late endosomes, facilitating various intracellular processes such as autophagy, endocytosis, gene transcription, and exosome secretion (Shu2019Heparanase). HPSE is synthesized as a 68 kDa pre-proHPSE, which is processed and secreted, and its activity is dependent on an acidic environment (Shu2019Heparanase).

HPSE can be trafficked to the cell surface or released into the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it mediates the breakdown of extracellular pools of HS. This process releases latent pools of growth factors, promoting cell proliferation, motility, and angiogenesis (Shu2019Heparanase). Beyond its enzymatic functions, HPSE also triggers signaling pathways by interacting with specific transmembrane proteins, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (Shu2019Heparanase).

In osteoblasts, HPSE is associated with alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of bone turnover, and may regulate osteogenic gene expression and histone H3 modification, indicating a role in osteoblastogenesis and bone formation (Smith2010Heparanase).

## Clinical Significance
The HPSE gene, encoding the enzyme heparanase, is significantly implicated in various diseases due to its role in degrading heparan sulfate, a key component of the extracellular matrix. Alterations in HPSE expression are linked to cancer progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In cancer, HPSE is up-regulated in 90% of cases, facilitating tumor invasion by remodeling the extracellular matrix and releasing growth factors (Ostrovsky2020Mechanism). The rs4693608 SNP in the HPSE gene is associated with increased risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and affects recovery times of neutrophils and platelets (Ostrovsky2018Identification). This SNP also influences HPSE expression in mononuclear cells and is a genetic risk factor for sinusoid obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (Ostrovsky2018Identification).

In inflammatory diseases, HPSE is involved in conditions like atherosclerosis and diabetes. In atherosclerosis, HPSE inhibition can lower blood pressure and oxidative stress, while in diabetes, increased HPSE activity can degrade protective barriers in the pancreas, leading to beta cell death (Ostrovsky2020Mechanism). HPSE is also implicated in autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris, where certain genotypes are more frequent in patients (Ostrovsky2020Mechanism).

## Interactions
Heparanase (HPSE) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. HPSE interacts with the MRN complex, which includes MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1, crucial for DNA damage sensing and repair. This interaction suggests HPSE's role in modulating DNA damage responses and type I interferon production (Agelidis2021Dissociation). HPSE also binds to DNA, although the implications of this interaction are not fully understood (Agelidis2021Dissociation).

In the nucleus of T lymphocytes, HPSE associates with euchromatin and interacts with chromatin-modifying enzymes such as LSD1, a demethylase, and MLL, a methyltransferase. These interactions influence histone H3 methylation patterns, affecting gene transcription (He2012The). HPSE forms a complex with RNA polymerase II and histone H3, indicating its role in transcription regulation (He2012The).

HPSE also interacts with syndecans, particularly syndecan-1, facilitating its uptake and activation through high-affinity binding to heparan sulfate chains. This interaction is crucial for processes like exosome formation and cellular signaling (Vlodavsky2021Biology). These interactions highlight HPSE's multifaceted role in cellular proliferation, DNA damage response, and transcription regulation.
