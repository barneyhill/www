# IFFO1

## Overview
The IFFO1 gene encodes the protein intermediate filament family orphan 1, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in human cells. This protein is categorized as an intermediate filament-associated protein, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular structural integrity and organization. IFFO1 is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining cell shape, facilitating intracellular transport, and supporting cell division and differentiation. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other cytoskeletal elements. Additionally, IFFO1 has been implicated in DNA repair, suggesting a role in preserving neuronal cytoskeleton integrity and potentially influencing neuronal sensitivity to damage. Variants in the IFFO1 gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to neuronal injury and inflammation, which may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions (Neumann2022Rare; Neumann2021Rare).

## Structure


## Function
The IFFO1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and organization of the cytoskeleton in human cells. This protein is associated with intermediate filaments, which are essential for cellular stability and resilience. In healthy human cells, IFFO1 contributes to maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and supporting cellular processes such as division and differentiation (Neumann2022Rare; Neumann2021Rare).

IFFO1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other cytoskeletal components to facilitate these functions. Its involvement in DNA repair suggests that it may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the neuronal cytoskeleton, potentially affecting its sensitivity to damage (Neumann2022Rare). The gene's function in DNA repair and its impact on intermediate filaments like neurofilament light (NfL) are crucial for understanding its role in cellular structure and function (Neumann2021Rare).

Rare variants in IFFO1 have been associated with increased susceptibility to neuronal injury and inflammation, which may lead to neurodegeneration and dementia symptoms. This highlights the importance of IFFO1 in maintaining cellular health and its potential involvement in disease processes (Neumann2022Rare; Neumann2021Rare).

## Clinical Significance
The IFFO1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In ovarian cancer, the promoter of IFFO1 is hypermethylated, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this disease (Aydin2019Coexpression). In breast cancer, IFFO1 serves as a strong prognostic indicator, with its expression levels correlating with patient outcomes (Aydin2019Coexpression). In endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, IFFO1 is hypomethylated and up-regulated, indicating a role in the disease's progression (Aydin2019Coexpression).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), IFFO1 expression is associated with patient survival outcomes. High expression levels are linked to better overall survival, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), where its expression is higher compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Feng2017GenomeWide). The gene's methylation status also varies, with lower methylation observed in ADC (Feng2017GenomeWide). Despite these associations, IFFO1 was not linked to overall survival in a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Feng2017GenomeWide).

IFFO1 has also been identified in the context of ovarian cancer ascites, where it is involved in altered fucosylation processes, potentially influencing tumor progression (AlbertoAguilar2019Ascites).
