# IFIT1B

## Overview
The IFIT1B gene encodes the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1B, which is a crucial component of the innate immune response. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. IFIT1B is primarily involved in the regulation of mRNA translation, particularly under conditions of viral infection. It exhibits high affinity for cap0-mRNA structures, thereby inhibiting the formation of the 48S preinitiation complex and subsequently impeding viral replication. Additionally, IFIT1B can interact with initiator tRNA and 40S ribosomal subunits, further influencing translation processes. The expression of IFIT1B is significantly upregulated by interferons, underscoring its role in antiviral defense mechanisms (Kumar2013Inhibition).

## Interactions
IFIT1B interacts with mRNA cap structures, particularly cap0-mRNAs, with high affinity, outcompeting eIF4E and eIF4F for binding. This interaction involves the cap-proximal regions of the mRNA, preventing the formation of the 48S complex in an in vitro translation system (Kumar2013Inhibition). IFIT1B can also bind to cap1-mRNA, although with significantly lower affinity compared to cap0-mRNA (Kumar2013Inhibition).

In addition to mRNA interactions, IFIT1B binds to initiator tRNA, with competition observed between tRNA and cap0-mRNA for binding to the protein. IFIT1B can also interact with 40S ribosomal subunits, although this interaction is not strong enough to interfere with the assembly of 43S preinitiation complexes (Kumar2013Inhibition).

The protein is part of the innate immune response and is highly induced by interferons, playing a role in inhibiting viral replication. IFIT1B's interactions with mRNA and tRNA suggest a regulatory role in translation, potentially affecting the translation of specific cellular mRNAs (Kumar2013Inhibition).
