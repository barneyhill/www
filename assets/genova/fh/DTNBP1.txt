# DTNBP1

## Overview
The DTNBP1 gene encodes dystrobrevin binding protein 1, commonly referred to as dysbindin, which is a crucial component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Dysbindin is characterized by a coiled-coil domain that facilitates its interaction with other proteins, including dystrobrevins, and plays a significant role in intracellular protein trafficking and synaptic function (Benson2001Dysbindin; Guo2008The). This protein is predominantly involved in the transport and sorting of proteins to lysosome-related organelles and is implicated in synaptic vesicle trafficking, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission (Ghiani2011DysbindinContaining). Dysbindin's interactions extend to various cellular processes, including cell growth and proliferation, highlighting its diverse functional roles. Clinically, alterations in DTNBP1 expression have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, as well as other conditions like hepatocellular carcinoma and temporal lobe epilepsy, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Bray2005Haplotypes; Cheng2022Objective; Tao2021Genetic).

## Structure
The DTNBP1 gene encodes the protein dysbindin, which is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Benson2001Dysbindin). Dysbindin is a protein of 352 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 39.7 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.6 (Benson2001Dysbindin). The coiled-coil region is located between amino acids 88 and 177, which is crucial for its interaction with dystrobrevins (Benson2001Dysbindin). Dysbindin interacts specifically with α- and β-dystrobrevin, forming complexes in muscle and brain tissues (Benson2001Dysbindin).

The protein is involved in the dystrophin-associated protein complex, which connects the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and acts as a scaffold for signaling proteins (Guo2008The). Dysbindin is also a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), interacting with all other components of this complex (Guo2008The). Alternative splicing of the DTNBP1 gene may result in different isoforms, as suggested by the presence of a lower molecular weight band in Western blots (Benson2001Dysbindin). Dysbindin's structure and interactions suggest its significant role in cellular processes related to muscle and brain function.

## Function
The DTNBP1 gene encodes the protein dysbindin, which is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Dysbindin plays a crucial role in intracellular protein trafficking, particularly in the transport of proteins to lysosome-related organelles. It is involved in the proper sorting of melanosomal and lysosomal membrane proteins, and its deficiency can lead to missorting and abnormal accumulation of proteins in early endosomes (Ghiani2011DysbindinContaining).

In the brain, dysbindin is concentrated in synaptic vesicle membranes and postsynaptic densities, suggesting a role in glutamatergic synapses. It is involved in synaptic and microtubular functions, influencing presynaptic glutamate release, which is crucial for normal cognitive functions and memory processes (Talbot2006Dysbindin1). Dysbindin interacts with snapin, a protein with presynaptic functions, and is part of complexes that may shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, interacting with proteins involved in nuclear export and DNA repair (Talbot2006Dysbindin1; Ghiani2011DysbindinContaining).

Dysbindin's role in synaptic function extends to its involvement in the regulation of synaptic protein levels and vesicle release, impacting neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission (Ghiani2011DysbindinContaining). Its deficiency has been linked to altered synaptic functions and cognitive impairments, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal brain function (Ghiani2011DysbindinContaining).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DTNBP1 gene, also known as dystrobrevin binding protein 1, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. DTNBP1 is associated with schizophrenia, where certain haplotypes are linked to reduced expression of the gene, potentially contributing to the disorder's pathophysiology (Bray2005Haplotypes). The gene's involvement in schizophrenia is further supported by its interaction with other genes in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), such as the MUTED gene, which may contribute to schizophrenia susceptibility through epistatic interactions (Morris2008Dysbindin).

DTNBP1 is also implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. High levels of DTNBP1 correlate with shorter overall survival in HCC patients, and its expression influences cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis (Cheng2022Objective).

In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), certain polymorphisms in DTNBP1 are associated with the condition, suggesting that alterations in DTNBP1 expression may contribute to epilepsy pathologies (Tao2021Genetic). The gene is also linked to cognitive impairments and is considered a susceptibility gene for autism spectrum disorders (Sinclair2016Effects).

## Interactions
The DTNBP1 gene encodes dysbindin-1, a protein that participates in various protein interactions, forming a complex interactome. Dysbindin-1 is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1) and interacts with all seven other components of this complex, including pallidin and muted (Talbot2009Dysbindin1; Guo2008The). It also interacts with the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, although the physiological relevance of this interaction is debated (Talbot2009Dysbindin1).

Dysbindin-1 interacts with proteins such as AP-3mA, b-dystrobrevin, cyclin A2, and rab11A, often outside its coiled-coil domain, particularly in the C-terminal region (Talbot2009Dysbindin1). These interactions suggest roles in synaptic vesicle trafficking and recycling endosome function, as dysbindin-1 is enriched in synaptic fields and associated with synaptic vesicles (Talbot2009Dysbindin1).

Dysbindin-1 also interacts with proteins involved in cell growth and proliferation, such as RNF151, which is implicated in spermatogenesis, and cyclin A2, which is critical for cell cycle transitions (Talbot2009Dysbindin1). These interactions highlight dysbindin-1's diverse roles in cellular processes and its potential impact on cognitive functions and psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia (Talbot2009Dysbindin1).
