# AEN

## Overview
The AEN gene encodes the apoptosis enhancing nuclease, a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in response to DNA damage and cellular stress. As an exonuclease, the apoptosis enhancing nuclease is involved in the degradation of DNA during the apoptotic process, distinguishing itself from endonucleases by its inability to cleave circular plasmid DNA (Lee2005Identification). The protein is known to interact with key apoptotic factors such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and caspase-activated DNase (CAD), facilitating DNA fragmentation in the nucleus following apoptotic stimuli (Lee2005Identification). Beyond its role in apoptosis, AEN is implicated in the cellular response to genotoxic stress and viral infections, where its expression is modulated to influence cell survival and immune responses (Gato2014Timedependent; Luo2023AEN). These functions highlight the gene's significance in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AEN gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions. AEN is known to play a significant role in the apoptotic response to genotoxic chemicals, such as 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), a compound that can induce liver toxicity. Studies have shown that AEN expression is significantly upregulated in response to 2AA exposure, correlating with increased apoptosis levels in the liver. This suggests that dysregulation of AEN expression may contribute to liver damage and potentially other related diseases due to environmental toxin exposure (Gato2014Timedependent).

In the context of viral infections, AEN has been identified as an antiviral component that can suppress the replication of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) by inducing the expression of type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, PEDV has evolved mechanisms to degrade AEN protein, thereby evading the host's immune response. This interaction highlights the potential for viral pathogens to exploit AEN dysregulation to enhance their replication, which could have implications for understanding viral pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies (Luo2023AEN).

These findings underscore the importance of AEN in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in disease processes when its expression or function is altered.

## Interactions
AEN (apoptosis enhancing nuclease) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly in the context of apoptosis and the cellular response to ionizing radiation. AEN exhibits significant homology to various exonucleases and is known to cleave DNA substrates, including single-stranded, blunt end double-stranded, 3' recessed, and branched DNA, indicating its role as an exonuclease (Lee2005Identification). It does not cleave circular plasmid DNA, suggesting it acts specifically as an exonuclease rather than an endonuclease (Lee2005Identification).

AEN is implicated in the apoptotic process through its interactions with other apoptotic proteins. It colocalizes with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and caspase-activated DNase (CAD) in the nucleus following ionizing radiation, suggesting potential physical interactions with these proteins during apoptosis (Lee2005Identification). AIF translocates to the nucleus upon apoptotic stress and colocalizes with AEN, indicating a role in DNA fragmentation (Lee2005Identification). CAD, which is present in the nucleus as an inactive form, shows more extensive colocalization with AEN following ionizing radiation, further supporting AEN's involvement in apoptosis (Lee2005Identification). These interactions highlight AEN's role in DNA processing and its potential cooperation with other nucleases in the apoptotic response.
