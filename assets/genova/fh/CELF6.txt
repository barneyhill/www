# CELF6

## Overview
CELF6 is a gene that encodes the protein CUGBP Elav-like family member 6, which is part of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and plays a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation, particularly within the brain. CELF6 is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation by binding to U-, UGU-, and CU-rich sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and kidneys and is subject to regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CELF6's function is crucial for maintaining normal synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling, and its disruption has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (Dougherty2013The; Maloney2015The; Rieger2020CLIP).

## Structure
CELF6, a member of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins, is characterized by a conserved structure featuring three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). These motifs are distributed with RRM1 and RRM2 located at the N-terminus and RRM3 at the C-terminus, separated by a divergent domain (Dasgupta2011The; Gallo2010The). The divergent domain, consisting of 268 amino acids, is crucial for the protein's function in RNA binding and splicing activity (Maloney2015The). This domain is less conserved compared to the RRMs and plays a significant role in differentiating CELF proteins into subfamilies (Dasgupta2011The).

CELF6 is known to bind to U-, UGU-, and CU-rich sequences, particularly in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs, which suggests its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation (Rieger2020CLIP). The protein is expressed in two isoforms, with the longest isoform being predominantly expressed in the brain and kidneys (Maloney2015The). CELF6 is subject to regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF-β-TrCP, although this interaction is phosphorylation-independent (Liu2019RNAbinding).

## Function
CELF6 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation, particularly in the brain. It primarily associates with the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs, where it influences mRNA stability and translation. CELF6 is involved in destabilizing synaptic gene mRNAs by enhancing their degradation, a process that is mediated through interaction with UGU-rich sequence motifs in the 3' UTRs (Rieger2018CLIPSeq; Rieger2020CLIP). This function is consistent with the actions of other CELF family members, such as CELF3, CELF4, and CELF5, which also regulate mRNA abundance in a sequence-dependent manner (Rieger2020CLIP).

In healthy cells, CELF6's activity is crucial for maintaining normal brain function by regulating the abundance of synaptic proteins, which are essential for synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling (Rieger2018CLIPSeq; Rieger2020CLIP). The protein is enriched in serotonin-producing neurons, and its disruption is associated with behavioral deficits, highlighting its importance in cognitive and behavioral processes (Rieger2018CLIPSeq). CELF6's role extends beyond mRNA degradation, as it may also influence mRNA localization and protein expression, affecting synaptic connections and neuronal function (Rieger2020CLIP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CELF6 gene have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental conditions. Studies have shown that disruptions in CELF6 can lead to autism-related behaviors, particularly affecting communication and social interaction. For instance, Celf6 knockout mice exhibit significant reductions in ultrasonic vocalizations, a form of social communication, indicating early communicative deficits (Dougherty2013The). These mice also display resistance to change and altered responses to rewarding experiences, which are behaviors consistent with autism (Dougherty2013The).

CELF6 is expressed in monoaminergic neurons, including serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic populations. Its disruption leads to decreased levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, suggesting that behavioral circuits involving these neurotransmitters are particularly vulnerable (Maloney2019Loss). The gene's role in regulating RNA splicing and its interaction with synaptic gene mRNAs may contribute to its involvement in these behavioral changes (Rieger2020CLIP).

Although recent genomic studies have not identified new CELF6 variants in autism, existing mutations clearly alter behavior, indicating its potential role in autism-like behaviors (Maloney2019Loss). The gene's involvement in alternative splicing and its expression in key brain regions underscore its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Maloney2015The).

## Interactions
CELF6, a member of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins, participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in cellular processes. CELF6 interacts with the SCF-β-TrCP complex, a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which mediates its degradation. This interaction is phosphorylation-independent and involves a specific sequence located between amino acids 224-287 of CELF6 (Liu2019RNAbinding). The interaction with β-TrCP is crucial for regulating CELF6 protein levels, as knockdown of β-TrCP leads to increased CELF6 stability (Liu2019RNAbinding).

CELF6 also binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the p21 mRNA, stabilizing the transcript and enhancing its expression. This interaction is essential for CELF6's role in cell cycle regulation and its function as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (Liu2019RNAbinding). In the brain, CELF6 binds to UGU-rich motifs in the 3'UTR of synaptic gene mRNAs, leading to their destabilization and decreased abundance, which suggests a role in mRNA degradation (Rieger2018CLIPSeq). These interactions highlight CELF6's multifaceted role in regulating mRNA stability and protein expression.
