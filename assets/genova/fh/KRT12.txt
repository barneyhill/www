# KRT12

## Overview
KRT12 is a gene that encodes keratin 12, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the corneal epithelium. Keratin 12 plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of corneal epithelial cells, which is essential for corneal transparency and vision. The protein is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, which facilitate filament assembly and tissue-specific functions. Keratin 12 forms heterodimers with type II keratins, such as keratin 3, to create intermediate filaments that provide structural support to epithelial cells. Mutations in the KRT12 gene are linked to Meesmann epithelial corneal dystrophy (MECD), a condition that affects the corneal epithelium, leading to symptoms such as photophobia and blurred vision due to the formation of intra-epithelial microcysts (Allen2016Keratin; Wolosin2024A).

## Structure
Keratin 12 (KRT12) is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in the corneal epithelium. Its molecular structure is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is crucial for the formation of coiled-coil motifs. This rod domain is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, which play significant roles in filament assembly and tissue-specific functions (Allen2016Keratin).

The primary structure of KRT12 includes a sequence rich in cysteine residues, allowing for a high degree of disulfide cross-linking, which is essential for the protein's function in forming tough polymers in tissues (Smith2003The). The secondary structure involves the formation of coiled-coil motifs, which are integral to the protein's stability and function (Allen2016Keratin).

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT12 forms filamentous networks that provide structural support to epithelial cells. The quaternary structure involves heterodimerization with type II keratins, such as keratin 3, to form intermediate filaments that contribute to the mechanical resilience of the corneal epithelium (Allen2016Keratin).

Common post-translational modifications of KRT12 include phosphorylation, which can influence the protein's function and interactions (Allen2016Keratin).

## Function
Keratin 12 (KRT12) is a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the corneal epithelium. It plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of corneal epithelial cells, which is essential for corneal transparency and vision. KRT12 is involved in cytoskeletal organization, contributing to cell stability and protection against mechanical stress (Wolosin2024A; Kao2020Keratin).

During the differentiation of corneal epithelial cells, KRT12 expression increases as cells migrate from the limbus to the central cornea, marking the transition from stem/precursor cells to more differentiated states. This process is crucial for the maintenance of the corneal epithelium and involves changes in gene expression that prepare the cells for their roles in the central cornea (Wolosin2024A). KRT12 expression is also associated with committed corneal transient amplifying cells, indicating its role in the maturation and differentiation of these cells (Kao2020Keratin).

The expression of KRT12 is regulated through clonal allelic activation, a form of monoallelic expression, which is important for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the corneal epithelium (Hayashi2010Monoallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT12 gene are associated with Meesmann epithelial corneal dystrophy (MECD), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by fragility of the corneal epithelium. This condition is caused by dominant-negative mutations within the KRT12 gene, which lead to the formation of intra-epithelial microcysts in the central cornea. These microcysts can cause symptoms such as photophobia, blurred vision, and a sensation of a foreign body in the eye due to the rupture of epithelial cysts (Allen2016Keratin; Coleman1999A).

The mutations in KRT12 are typically missense mutations that occur in critical helix motifs, leading to protein misfolding and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can result in apoptosis (Allen2016Keratin). Specific mutations, such as the K12-Leu132Pro, have been associated with severe phenotypes, including subepithelial basement membrane scarring and central corneal opacification, potentially leading to blindness (Allen2016Keratin).

Studies have identified various mutations in KRT12, including M129T, R135T, and I426V, which are located in conserved regions crucial for intermediate filament assembly, contributing to the structural integrity of the corneal epithelium (Coleman1999A; CORDEN2000Molecular). These mutations highlight the importance of KRT12 in maintaining corneal integrity and its role in the pathogenesis of MECD.

## Interactions
Keratin 12 (KRT12) is a type I cytokeratin that primarily interacts with keratin 3 (KRT3) to form intermediate filaments in the corneal epithelium. These filaments are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of the corneal epithelium against mechanical stress (Allen2016Keratin). In the context of Meesmann epithelial corneal dystrophy (MECD), a missense mutation in KRT12, specifically Leu132Pro, disrupts these interactions, leading to protein misfolding and triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis in corneal epithelial cells (Allen2016Keratin).

In the absence of functional KRT12, there is an upregulation of other keratins such as KRT14, KRT6, and KRT16, which are typically associated with stress responses in epithelial tissues (Allen2016Keratin). This altered expression pattern suggests compensatory mechanisms in response to the loss of KRT12 function. In mice, KRT12 interacts with keratin 5 (KRT5) as its endogenous polymerization partner in the cornea, and the expression of KRT5 decreases when wild-type KRT12 expression is reduced (Allen2016Keratin). These interactions highlight the complex network of keratin interactions necessary for corneal epithelial homeostasis and the impact of KRT12 mutations on this network.
