# KCNN2

## Overview
The KCNN2 gene encodes the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel subfamily N member 2 (SK2), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. SK2 channels are activated by intracellular calcium levels and are integral to the afterhyperpolarization phase of action potentials, thereby influencing neuronal firing rates and maintaining resting membrane potential (Hammond2006SmallConductance; Bond2004Small). These channels are predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within the hippocampus, where they contribute to learning and memory by regulating synaptic transmission (Bond2005SK; Hammond2006SmallConductance). Beyond the central nervous system, SK2 channels are also implicated in cardiac function, where they interact with various proteins to influence cardiac repolarization and arrhythmogenesis (Zhang2021Cardiac). Mutations in KCNN2 have been associated with neurological disorders such as essential tremor and neurodevelopmental movement disorders, as well as cardiac conditions like atrial fibrillation, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in both neurological and cardiac pathologies (d’Apolito2023A; Yu2016KCNN2).

## Structure
The KCNN2 gene encodes the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 2 (SK2), which is part of the potassium channel family. The primary structure of SK2 includes six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and a pore-forming loop between S5 and S6, similar to voltage-gated potassium channels (Pedarzani2008Molecular; Köhler1996SmallConductance). The secondary structure features alpha helices within these transmembrane regions (Köhler1996SmallConductance). 

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices to form a functional channel, while the quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of tetrameric complexes, which can be either homo- or hetero-tetrameric (Mochel2020Variants). SK2 channels contain calmodulin-binding domains (CaMBD), which are crucial for calcium sensitivity and are located adjacent to the S6 transmembrane segment (Stocker2004Ca2+activated). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect channel activity (Köhler1996SmallConductance). The KCNN2 gene also produces splice variant isoforms, which differ in regulatory properties and structural features, such as the presence or absence of certain transmembrane domains (Willis2016Smallconductance).

## Function
The KCNN2 gene encodes the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel type 2 (SK2), which plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. SK2 channels are activated by intracellular calcium levels and contribute to the afterhyperpolarization phase of action potentials, which helps modulate the firing rates of neurons and maintain resting membrane potential (Hammond2006SmallConductance; Bond2004Small). These channels are primarily active in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, where they influence learning and memory processes by regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity (Bond2005SK; Hammond2006SmallConductance).

SK2 channels are involved in the apamin-sensitive component of the medium duration afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons, which is important for dampening membrane excitability and contributing to dendritic integration (Bond2005SK; Bond2004Small). They are part of macromolecular complexes that include calcium sources and modulatory proteins, which determine the kinetics and effects of SK channel activation (Bond2005SK). Alterations in KCNN2 have been linked to movement disorders and memory deficits, highlighting its role in motor and cognitive functions (Mochel2020Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNN2 gene, which encodes the SK2 subunit of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, have been implicated in various neurological and cardiac disorders. In the context of neurological conditions, KCNN2 variants have been associated with essential tremor, a common movement disorder characterized by involuntary shaking, often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. A novel heterozygous missense variant in KCNN2 was identified in an Italian family with essential tremor plus, suggesting a genetic link to the disorder (d’Apolito2023A). Additionally, KCNN2 mutations have been linked to neurodevelopmental movement disorders, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and movement disorders such as tremor and cerebellar ataxia (Mochel2020Variants).

In cardiac conditions, KCNN2 polymorphisms have been associated with cardiac tachyarrhythmias, including ventricular tachyarrhythmia and atrial fibrillation. These polymorphisms may serve as markers for risk stratification in patients susceptible to sudden cardiac death, highlighting the gene's role in cardiac repolarization and arrhythmogenesis (Yu2016KCNN2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KCNN2 in both neurological and cardiac pathologies.

## Interactions
The KCNN2 gene encodes the SK2 channel, a small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that interacts with several proteins to regulate its function. Calmodulin (CaM) is a key interacting partner, binding constitutively to SK2 and mediating its calcium sensitivity. The C-terminal domain of CaM is crucial for Ca2+-independent interactions, while the N-terminal domain is essential for Ca2+-dependent channel gating (Keen1999Domains).

SK2 channels are part of a multiprotein complex that includes protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). CK2 phosphorylates SK2-bound CaM, reducing the channel's Ca2+ sensitivity, while PP2A counteracts this effect, suggesting opposing roles in modulating SK2 activity (Allen2007Organization). CK2 interacts with both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of SK2, indicating complex interactions with noncontiguous segments of the channel (Allen2007Organization).

In cardiac cells, SK2 channels also interact with proteins such as α-actinin2, filamin A, and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), which are important for the channel's expression, function, and trafficking (Zhang2021Cardiac). These interactions highlight the intricate regulatory network involving SK2 channels and their associated proteins.
