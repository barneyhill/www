# HTR1D

## Overview
The HTR1D gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D (5-HTR1D), a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a pivotal role in neurotransmission. This receptor is primarily activated by serotonin, a key neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, anxiety, and appetite, as well as contributing to vasoconstriction. The 5-HTR1D receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it modulates the release of other neurotransmitters and influences neuronal communication. It is coupled with the G-protein Gαi/o, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to decreased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and affecting various signaling pathways, including ERK phosphorylation through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism (Karmakar2021Role). The gene and its encoded receptor have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including type 2 diabetes, anorexia nervosa, and colorectal cancer, highlighting their significance in both physiological and pathological processes (Zeng2019HTR1D; Bennet2015Altered; Bergen2003Candidate).

## Function
The HTR1D gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D (5-HTR1D), which is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in neurotransmission. This receptor is activated by serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in modulating various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, 5-HTR1D is involved in the regulation of mood, anxiety, and appetite, and it contributes to vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels (Karmakar2021Role).

The 5-HTR1D receptor is predominantly active in the central nervous system, where it modulates the release of other neurotransmitters, thereby influencing neuronal communication and function. It is coupled with the intracellular G-protein Gαi/o, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to a decrease in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. This signaling pathway can also enhance ERK phosphorylation through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and survival (Karmakar2021Role).

Overall, the 5-HTR1D receptor plays a significant role in maintaining normal physiological functions by regulating neurotransmitter release and influencing various signaling pathways within the central nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
The HTR1D gene, encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or genetic variations. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), increased expression of HTR1D in pancreatic islets has been associated with defective insulin and glucagon secretion. This altered expression may contribute to islet dysfunction, potentially exacerbating the pathophysiology of T2D (Bennet2015Altered).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, variations in the HTR1D gene have been linked to anorexia nervosa (AN). Studies have identified significant associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTR1D and AN, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the disorder. These SNPs may influence gene expression or be linked to other polymorphisms affecting expression, although they are unlikely to directly alter receptor function (Bergen2003Candidate).

HTR1D has also been associated with colon adenocarcinoma, where its expression is upregulated in tumor tissues. This upregulation is linked to patient survival, indicating a potential role in tumor biology and as a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer (Zeng2019HTR1D). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HTR1D in various diseases.

## Interactions
The HTR1D gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D, which is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer, the 5-HT1D receptor interacts with Axin1, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the release of Axin1 from the destruction complex, resulting in the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and activation of the β-catenin/LEF1/TCF4/MMP-7 pathway, which is associated with cancer metastasis (Sui20155hydroxytryptamine). The interaction between 5-HT1D and Axin1 was confirmed through ChIP analysis, demonstrating that Axin1 co-precipitates with 5-HT1D in overexpressing colorectal cancer cells (Sui20155hydroxytryptamine).

Additionally, 5-HT-moduline, an endogenous peptide, specifically interacts with the 5-HT1D receptor. This interaction is non-competitive and antagonistic, affecting the receptor's coupling to G-proteins and altering the binding characteristics of [3H]5-HT. The peptide decreases the maximal binding of [3H]5-HT and increases the affinity of 5-HT for the receptor, highlighting its role as an allosteric modulator (Rousselle1998Specific). These interactions underscore the receptor's involvement in modulating neurotransmitter release and cellular signaling pathways.
