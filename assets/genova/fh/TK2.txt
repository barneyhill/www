# TK2

## Overview
Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme belonging to the kinase family, specifically involved in the phosphorylation of pyrimidine deoxynucleosides. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and function. Unlike its cytosolic counterpart, thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), TK2 operates predominantly in non-dividing cells, ensuring a continuous supply of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) necessary for mtDNA replication and repair (Rampazzo2007Mitochondrial). The enzyme's activity is regulated through complex interactions and feedback mechanisms, including substrate binding and post-translational modifications (Wang2018Negative; Sun2012Oxidative). Mutations in the TK2 gene are linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes, which manifest in a range of myopathic conditions with varying severity and age of onset, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene (DomínguezGonzález2022Muscle; Berardo2022Advances).

## Structure
Human thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of pyrimidine deoxynucleosides. The primary structure of TK2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 27.5 kDa, as encoded by its cDNA (Johansson1997Cloning). The enzyme shares structural similarities with other deoxynucleoside kinases, such as human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), and is part of a homologous superfamily characterized by a P-loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolase structure with a three-layer (αβα) sandwich architecture and a Rossmann fold (Pérez‐Pérez2008Structure).

The tertiary structure of TK2 has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, as no crystal structure is available. These models suggest that TK2 has a flexible binding site that can accommodate various inhibitors, indicating a pronounced adaptability similar to other nucleoside kinases (Pérez‐Pérez2008Structure). The enzyme's quaternary structure may involve homodimer formation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

TK2 lacks a mitochondrial translocation signal motif, which is unusual for a mitochondrial enzyme (Johansson1997Cloning). The enzyme is expressed in multiple tissues, with two mRNA species identified, suggesting the presence of splice variant isoforms (Johansson1997Cloning).

## Function
Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis, particularly in non-proliferating cells. It phosphorylates pyrimidine deoxynucleosides, such as thymidine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyuridine, to their corresponding deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates using ATP. This process is essential for maintaining the mitochondrial deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) pool, which is necessary for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and repair (Pérez‐Pérez2008Structure; Rampazzo2007Mitochondrial).

In non-dividing cells, TK2 is the primary enzyme responsible for the salvage of thymidine, as these cells lack the S-phase-regulated cytosolic thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and ribonucleotide reductase (Rampazzo2007Mitochondrial). TK2's activity is crucial for maintaining mtDNA integrity, ensuring a continuous supply of dNTPs, and preventing mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (Pérez‐Pérez2008Structure).

TK2 is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle and is often the only active thymidine kinase in resting cells, highlighting its importance in mtDNA maintenance (Pérez‐Pérez2008Structure). Its activity is regulated by thymidine phosphorylase, which degrades thymidine in the cytoplasm, limiting its availability for phosphorylation by TK2 in mitochondria (Rampazzo2007Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) gene are associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndromes, which are characterized by a significant reduction in mtDNA content. These syndromes manifest as a spectrum of myopathic conditions with varying severity and age of onset. The most severe form is early infantile-onset, which presents with rapid progression and often results in death within the first two years of life. Symptoms include muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and neurological involvement (DomínguezGonzález2022Muscle; Berardo2022Advances).

Childhood-onset TK2 deficiency typically leads to progressive muscle weakness, facial diplegia, and respiratory complications, often requiring ventilatory support. Late-onset forms are less severe, with slower progression and symptoms such as ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and dysphagia (Berardo2022Advances; DomínguezGonzález2019Lateonset). Muscle biopsies in affected individuals often reveal mitochondrial dysfunction and dystrophic changes (Berardo2022Advances).

The clinical presentation of TK2-related disorders is highly variable, with some patients maintaining mobility for extended periods, while others experience rapid decline. Genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis, as traditional methods like muscle biopsy may not always be necessary (Wang2018Clinical). Emerging therapies, such as deoxynucleoside supplementation, show promise in delaying disease progression and improving outcomes (Berardo2022Advances).

## Interactions
Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. TK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine (dC), with its activity being regulated by feedback inhibition from its end products, deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) (Wang2018Negative). The enzyme exhibits negative cooperative binding with thymidine, indicating complex binding behavior with two distinct affinity sites (Wang2018Negative). 

TK2 also interacts with ATP, which binds tightly to dT- or dC-TK2 complexes, suggesting an ordered substrate binding and product release mechanism (Wang2018Negative). This interaction is facilitated by a conformational change upon nucleoside binding, which allows ATP to bind (Wang2018Negative). 

In addition to its interactions with substrates and inhibitors, TK2 undergoes S-glutathionylation, a reversible modification that affects its activity. This modification involves specific cysteine residues, such as Cys-189 and Cys-264, which are critical for the regulation of TK2 activity under oxidative stress conditions (Sun2012Oxidative). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing TK2's role in mitochondrial function.
