# CFDP1

## Overview
The CFDP1 gene encodes the craniofacial development protein 1, a member of the BCNT protein family, which is evolutionarily conserved across species. This protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature and contains a BCNT-C domain that is crucial for its function in chromatin dynamics. CFDP1 plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling, particularly through its involvement in the SRCAP complex, which facilitates the exchange of histone variants and is essential for maintaining chromatin structure and gene expression regulation. The protein is implicated in critical cellular processes such as mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation, highlighting its importance in cell cycle progression. Clinically, CFDP1 is associated with craniofacial and cardiovascular development, with mutations linked to developmental disorders and cardiovascular diseases (Messina2017The; Giardoglou2023Cfdp1; Gopinathan2024CFDP1).

## Structure
The CFDP1 protein, encoded by the human CFDP1 gene, is a member of the evolutionarily conserved BCNT protein family. It consists of 299 amino acids and features a highly conserved 82-amino acid region at the C-terminus known as the BCNT-C domain (Messina2017The; Celauro2017Functional). The primary structure includes an acidic N-terminal region and a lysine/glutamic acid/proline-rich segment, contributing to its intrinsically disordered nature (Iwashita2015Mammalian).

The CFDP1 protein is largely disordered, with secondary structure predictions indicating coiled-coil α-helix stretches in the C-terminal portion, which are implicated in mediating homodimerization (Messina2016Expression). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. Notably, Ser 250 in the BCNT-C domain is heavily phosphorylated, and acetylation occurs at multiple lysine residues (Iwashita2015Mammalian).

CFDP1 exists in two isoforms, approximately 50 kDa and 35 kDa, likely due to alternative splicing. The 50 kDa isoform includes the BCNT domain and is involved in chromatin binding, while the 35 kDa isoform lacks this domain and may have different functions (Messina2017The). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SRCAP complex, suggesting a role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation (Messina2017The).

## Function
The CFDP1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of pericentric heterochromatin, which is essential for proper chromatin organization and cell cycle progression. CFDP1 is involved in the assembly and duplication of pericentric heterochromatin during the cell cycle, associating with major components such as HP1α and H3K9me3. Its depletion leads to a significant loss of the CENP-A nucleosome variant at minor satellite repeats, affecting chromatin structure and delaying S phase progression (Gopinathan2024CFDP1).

CFDP1 is also crucial for mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation. It interacts with RCC1, a spindle nucleation facilitator, and promotes the generation of RanGTP, which is necessary for microtubule nucleation during mitosis. Knockdown of CFDP1 results in defects such as lagging chromosomes and disorganized spindle formation, highlighting its role in microtubule dynamics and spindle stability (Gopinathan2024CFDP1).

CFDP1 is part of the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex, facilitating the exchange of canonical histone H2A with the variant H2A.Z, which is crucial for chromatin organization and gene expression regulation (Celauro2017Functional). It is active in the nucleus, particularly at pericentric heterochromatin, influencing chromatin accessibility and compaction (Gopinathan2024CFDP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CFDP1 gene have been linked to several developmental and cardiovascular conditions. In craniofacial development, CFDP1 is crucial for maintaining higher-order chromatin organization, and its depletion can lead to craniofacial malformations, which are significant causes of infant mortality and disability. These malformations are often associated with epigenetic diseases and can be linked to conditions such as CHARGE syndrome and Floating Harbor syndrome, which involve mutations in genes associated with chromatin remodeling (Messina2017The; Celauro2017Functional).

CFDP1 is also implicated in cardiovascular development. Mutations in CFDP1 can lead to defects in cardiac trabeculation, potentially resulting in embryonic lethality or adult dilated cardiomyopathies. Genome-wide association studies have linked CFDP1 to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk and carotid intima-media thickness, a marker for subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Giardoglou2023Cfdp1). In zebrafish models, CFDP1 mutations result in arrhythmic hearts and defective cardiac performance, underscoring its essential role in cardiac development and function (Giardoglou2023Cfdp1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CFDP1 in both craniofacial and cardiovascular health.

## Interactions
CFDP1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin organization and dynamics. It is part of the Bucentaur (BCNT) family and interacts with the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex, specifically with Arp6 and P18 Hamlet, but not directly with HA-H2A.Z or HA-SRCAP, suggesting a role in H2A-H2B eviction rather than H2A.Z-H2B deposition (Messina2017The). CFDP1 also interacts with HP1α, a heterochromatin protein, indicating its involvement in maintaining chromatin structure (Messina2017The; Gopinathan2024CFDP1).

CFDP1 promotes the interaction between RCC1 and H2A.Z nucleosomes, which is crucial for chromatin stability and spindle formation during mitosis. Loss of CFDP1 results in decreased RCC1 binding to chromatin, affecting RanGTP levels and microtubule nucleation (Gopinathan2024CFDP1). CFDP1's interaction with H2A.Z is supported by its colocalization at genomic repeats and its higher affinity for H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes compared to canonical H2A nucleosomes (Gopinathan2024CFDP1).

CFDP1 also interacts with SMAD3 and Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) proteins, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Messina2014The). These interactions highlight CFDP1's multifaceted role in chromatin remodeling and cellular processes.
