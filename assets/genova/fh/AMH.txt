# AMH

## Overview
The AMH gene encodes the anti-Müllerian hormone, a glycoprotein that is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This hormone plays a pivotal role in sexual differentiation and reproductive function. In males, anti-Müllerian hormone is crucial for the regression of Müllerian ducts during fetal development, thereby preventing the formation of female reproductive structures. In females, it is produced by ovarian granulosa cells and is involved in the regulation of folliculogenesis by inhibiting the recruitment of primordial follicles and modulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) sensitivity. The AMH protein functions as a homodimer and interacts specifically with its receptor, AMHR2, to initiate signaling pathways that are essential for its biological activity (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian; Howard2022Molecular). Mutations in the AMH gene can lead to reproductive disorders such as persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) in males and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females, highlighting its clinical significance (Alvaro2015AMH; Mullen2019AMH).

## Structure
The anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein hormone that is part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The human AMH protein is synthesized as a precursor of 560 amino acids, which includes a signal sequence, a prodomain, and a mature domain (Lasala2004Subcellular; Howard2022Molecular). The signal sequence consists of residues 1-24, the prodomain spans residues 25-451, and the mature domain includes residues 452-560 (Howard2022Molecular).

The AMH protein forms a homodimer linked by disulfide bonds, which is essential for its biological activity (Lasala2004Subcellular). The C-terminal domain of AMH is responsible for its biological activity and shares homology with other TGF-β family members, particularly in the conserved cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds (Wilson1993Mullerian; Pepinsky1988Proteolytic). The prodomain is involved in folding, dimerization, and secretion, and remains noncovalently associated with the mature domain after cleavage (Howard2022Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of AMH include glycosylation, which may impact protein interactions or cleavage (Howard2022Molecular). The AMH gene is located on chromosome 19p13.2-13.3 and is divided into five exons, with the fifth exon showing the highest interspecies homology (Lasala2004Subcellular).

## Function
Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein hormone that plays a crucial role in the regulation of ovarian function and folliculogenesis in females. It is produced by granulosa cells of small growing follicles in the ovary, with its expression beginning when primordial follicles are recruited to grow. AMH is most highly expressed in pre-antral and small antral follicles and declines as follicles reach about 8 mm in diameter, coinciding with follicular selection for dominance (Dewailly2014The; van2010AntiMüllerian).

AMH functions primarily by inhibiting the recruitment of primordial follicles into the pool of growing follicles, thereby maintaining the ovarian reserve and preventing premature depletion of the follicle pool. It also decreases the sensitivity of growing follicles to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibiting FSH-induced follicle growth and reducing granulosa cell proliferation (Durlinger2002Regulation; Gruijters2003AntiMüllerian). This regulation is crucial for controlling the rate of follicle recruitment and ensuring a balanced follicular development (van2010AntiMüllerian).

AMH also acts as a gatekeeper of follicular estrogen production by down-regulating the aromatizing capacity of granulosa cells, thereby reducing estradiol production until follicular selection (Dewailly2014The). This hormone's expression pattern and its regulatory effects on follicle growth and hormone production underscore its importance in female reproductive health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) gene are associated with several reproductive disorders. Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a condition resulting from mutations in the AMH or its receptor AMHR2, leading to the retention of Müllerian duct derivatives in males, such as a uterus and oviducts, despite normal male virilization. This condition is often linked to cryptorchidism and can result in infertility (Mullen2019AMH; Li2019Regulation). PMDS is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with numerous mutations identified in the AMH gene, including missense, stop, and splicing mutations (Mullen2019AMH).

In females, AMH mutations have been implicated in premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by the early depletion of ovarian follicles. Specific missense variants, such as G264R, D288E, and R444H, have been associated with reduced AMH bioactivity, contributing to POI (Alvaro2015AMH). These mutations can lead to altered protein function due to non-functional dimers, impacting ovarian function and fertility (Alvaro2015AMH).

Altered AMH levels are also linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where elevated AMH may enhance GnRH release, contributing to the hormonal imbalances characteristic of the condition (Silva2020New).

## Interactions
The anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) interacts with its specific type II receptor, AMHR2, to initiate signaling pathways. This interaction is unique within the TGF-beta family, as AMH and AMHR2 are mutually specific, unlike other family members that interact with multiple receptors (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian). AMH binds to AMHR2 using a distinct receptor binding interaction, involving the palm of the receptor and the knuckles of the ligand, with a shift towards the fingertips (Howard2022Molecular). This binding induces a conformational change in AMH, which is necessary for the recruitment of type I receptors (Cate2022Anti-Müllerian).

AMH primarily signals through type I receptors ALK2 and ALK3, which are part of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) branch of TGF-beta ligands, activating BMP R-Smads 1, 5, and 9 (Howard2022Molecular). The interaction between AMH and the type I receptor BMPR-IB is ligand-dependent, while its interaction with TbR-I is ligand-independent (Josso2001AntiMüllerian). AMH specifically induces the phosphorylation of Smad1, similar to BMP2, but not Smad2, indicating selective activation of Smad1 signal transduction (Josso2001AntiMüllerian). In the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), AMH affects the phosphorylation and levels of SMAD proteins differently, increasing inhibitory SMAD-6 and SMAD-7 in PCOS granulosa cells (Dilaver2019The).
