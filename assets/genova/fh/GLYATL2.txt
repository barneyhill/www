# GLYATL2

## Overview
GLYATL2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glycine-N-acyltransferase like 2, which is involved in the conjugation of long-chain fatty acid-CoA with glycine to form acylglycines. These acylglycines are important signaling molecules that resemble cannabinoids and are known to activate G-protein-coupled receptors, thereby exerting antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects (Badenhorst2013Glycine). The enzyme is categorized as a transferase and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it performs its catalytic functions (Matsuo2012Designation; Badenhorst2013Glycine). Although GLYATL2 shows a specific substrate preference, its enzymatic activity can be modulated by acetylation, particularly at Lys 19, which is crucial for its function (Badenhorst2013Glycine). The full spectrum of its biological roles in human physiology is still under investigation, but its involvement in cellular signaling highlights its potential importance in various physiological processes.

## Function
The GLYATL2 gene encodes an enzyme that primarily catalyzes the conjugation of long-chain fatty acid-CoA with glycine, forming acylglycines such as N-arachidonoylglycine and N-oleoylglycine. These acylglycines are part of a class of cannabinoid-like signaling hormones that activate G-protein-coupled receptors, contributing to antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects (Badenhorst2013Glycine). The enzyme is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it performs its catalytic functions (Matsuo2012Designation; Badenhorst2013Glycine).

Despite its role in catalyzing these reactions, GLYATL2 did not exhibit significant enzymatic activity under certain experimental conditions, nor did it show activity with taurine as an acyl acceptor, suggesting a specific substrate preference (Matsuo2012Designation). The enzyme's activity is regulated by acetylation on Lys 19, and mutations at this site can significantly decrease its activity, indicating a specific regulatory mechanism for GLYATL2 (Badenhorst2013Glycine). The precise biological roles of GLYATL2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in producing signaling molecules suggests a role in cellular communication and regulation.
