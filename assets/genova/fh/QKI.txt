# QKI

## Overview
QKI is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein belonging to the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family, which is integral to various RNA metabolic processes. The QKI protein, characterized by its KH domain, plays a pivotal role in RNA splicing, stability, and transport, influencing cellular differentiation and development. It is particularly crucial in the nervous system for myelination, affecting oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell maturation, and in cardiovascular development by regulating gene splicing related to sarcomere formation (Darbelli2016Emerging; Chen2021QKI). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, each with distinct cellular localizations and functions, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Kondo1999Genomic). QKI's involvement in neurological disorders and cancers underscores its clinical significance, with alterations in its expression linked to diseases such as schizophrenia and various tumors (Darbelli2016Emerging; Ji2012miR5745p).

## Structure
The QKI protein is a member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family, characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities. Its molecular structure includes a STAR domain composed of three main modules: Qua1, KH, and Qua2. The Qua1 module is involved in homodimerization, forming a symmetric dimer through hydrophobic interactions, which is crucial for its function in RNA recognition (Teplova2013Structure–function; Chen1998StructureFunction). The KH and Qua2 modules are responsible for RNA binding, with the KH domain adopting a specific topology of three alpha helices packed against a three-stranded beta sheet (Teplova2013Structure–function). 

The Qua1 domain adopts a helix-turn-helix fold, stabilized by hydrophobic 'zipper' residues and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which are essential for the dimerization interface (Teplova2013Structure–function). Mutations in the Qua1 and KH domains can disrupt dimerization and RNA binding, affecting the protein's function (Teplova2013Structure–function). The QKI protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Kondo1999Genomic). These structural features enable QKI to regulate RNA splicing, export, stability, and translation, particularly in the context of myelination and developmental processes (Teplova2013Structure–function).

## Function
The QKI gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is a member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family, playing a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and RNA transport (Chen2021The; Darbelli2016Emerging). QKI is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly influencing the inclusion or exclusion of exons in pre-mRNA, which is essential for generating diverse mRNA isoforms (Darbelli2016Emerging). It binds to specific RNA sequences known as Quaking Response Elements (QREs), affecting the stability and translation of target mRNAs (Darbelli2016Emerging).

In cellular processes, QKI is vital for myelination in the nervous system, influencing the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, which are essential for proper nerve function (2010; Chénard2007New). It also plays a role in cardiovascular development, particularly in cardiac myofibrillogenesis and contractile function, by regulating the splicing of genes involved in sarcomere formation (Chen2021QKI). QKI is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it impacts cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cell differentiation and survival (Darbelli2016Emerging; Chénard2007New).

## Clinical Significance
The QKI gene is implicated in several neurological disorders and cancers due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In schizophrenia, decreased expression of QKI splice variants, such as QKI-7 and QKI-7b, is associated with pathological changes in myelin and oligodendrocyte-related genes, potentially contributing to the disease's etiology (Darbelli2016Emerging; Åberg2005Human). QKI is also linked to 6q terminal deletion syndrome, where haploinsufficiency is associated with intellectual disabilities and other phenotypes (Darbelli2016Emerging).

In cancer, QKI acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in various tumors, including colorectal, gastric, and glioblastoma, often due to frameshift mutations or promoter hypermethylation (Mo2019Frameshift; Ji2012miR5745p). In colorectal cancer, QKI downregulation is linked to abnormal β-catenin and p27 Kip1 signaling (Ji2012miR5745p). In glioblastoma, QKI isoform alterations are observed in about 30% of cases, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Chénard2007New).

QKI is also involved in myelin disorders like multiple sclerosis, where it regulates oligodendrocyte development and differentiation, although its precise role in human myelination remains under investigation (Darbelli2016Emerging).

## Interactions
QKI, an RNA-binding protein, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA metabolism and cellular processes. QKI interacts with the mRNA encoding myelin basic protein (MBP), stabilizing it during myelinogenesis in the central nervous system. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of QKI by Src family protein tyrosine kinases (Src-PTKs), which modulates QKI's binding affinity to MBP mRNA (Zhang2003Tyrosine).

QKI isoforms, such as QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7, exhibit distinct cellular localizations and functions. QKI-5 is predominantly nuclear, while QKI-7 is cytoplasmic. QKI-6 is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. These isoforms can form heterodimers, which influence their functional roles, such as the suppression of apoptosis induced by QKI-7 through nuclear translocation (Pilotte2001Nuclear).

QKI-5 is involved in miRNA processing, specifically interacting with the Microprocessor complex components DGCR8 and Drosha, which are essential for miRNA maturation. This interaction is RNA-independent and highlights QKI-5's role in regulating miRNA processing during erythropoiesis (Wang2017The). QKI-7 also interacts with the poly(A) polymerase GLD-2, forming a complex that stabilizes miR-122, a microRNA important for metabolic processes (Hojo2020The).
