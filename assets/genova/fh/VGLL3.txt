# VGLL3

## Overview
VGLL3, or vestigial like family member 3, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional cofactor involved in various cellular processes, including myogenesis, immune response, and adipocyte differentiation. The VGLL3 protein interacts with TEAD transcription factors, such as TEAD1, TEAD3, and TEAD4, through a conserved TONDU domain, which is essential for its function in regulating gene expression (Figeac2019VGLL3; Mesrouze2020A). Unlike other members of the VGLL family, VGLL3 does not require an Ω-loop for its interaction with TEADs, relying solely on the TONDU domain for effective binding (Mesrouze2020A). VGLL3 plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, acting as a cofactor that can influence cell proliferation and differentiation. It is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can affect tumor progression and prognosis (Zhang2020VGLL3; Haque2023VGLL3).

## Structure
VGLL3 is a transcriptional cofactor that interacts with TEAD transcription factors through a conserved amino acid motif known as the TONDU domain, characterized by a β-strand:α-helix motif (Mesrouze2020A). This domain is crucial for its binding to TEAD proteins, similar to the vestigial gene in flies (Figeac2019VGLL3). Unlike VGLL2, VGLL3 does not require an Ω-loop for its interaction with TEAD, as the TONDU domain alone is sufficient for effective binding (Mesrouze2020A).

The VGLL3 protein structure has been modeled using the PHYRE2 protein fold recognition server, predicting a structure similar to VGLL1 and VGLL4 when complexed with TEAD4 (Figeac2019VGLL3). The predicted VGLL3 model has a high confidence score of 99.8% and shows structural similarity when overlaid on the VGLL1-TEAD4 and VGLL4-TEAD complexes (Figeac2019VGLL3).

VGLL3 is expressed as a protein of 320 amino acids in humans (Figeac2019VGLL3). The protein can localize to both the nucleus and cytosol, with a conserved nuclear export signal identified in its sequence (Figeac2019VGLL3). There is no detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
VGLL3 (vestigial like family member 3) is a transcriptional cofactor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including myogenesis, immune response, and adipocyte differentiation. In myogenesis, VGLL3 is crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, precursor cells that develop into muscle tissue. It operates through TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1, TEAD3, and TEAD4) to influence muscle development, promoting cell growth and differentiation in vitro, although its absence in vivo does not significantly affect muscle development, suggesting compensatory mechanisms (Figeac2019VGLL3).

In the immune system, VGLL3 is involved in the adaptation to nutritional stress, particularly in female keratinocytes. It upregulates IL-17C to support local defense and limits IL-1-mediated systemic inflammation, coordinating a reduction in energy demand during immune responses under metabolic stress (Pagenkopf2020Immunometabolic). VGLL3 also plays a role in adipocyte differentiation, acting as an inhibitor. Its expression is downregulated during adipogenesis, and overexpression inhibits lipid accumulation and adipogenic marker expression, suggesting VGLL3 directs mesenchymal stem cells towards non-adipose tissue differentiation pathways (Halperin2013Vestigiallike).

## Clinical Significance
VGLL3 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in tumor progression and prognosis. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), VGLL3 expression is associated with poor overall survival and advanced tumor stages. High VGLL3 expression correlates with increased macrophage infiltration, which is linked to poor prognosis, suggesting VGLL3's involvement in the tumor immune microenvironment (Haque2023VGLL3). In epithelial ovarian cancer, VGLL3 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor, with its expression being low or absent in high-grade serous carcinomas. This repression may contribute to cancer development, although VGLL3's tumor-suppressing role requires further investigation (Gambaro2013VGLL3).

In stomach adenocarcinoma, high VGLL3 expression is linked to poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. It is associated with immune cell infiltration and several cancer-related pathways, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020VGLL3). VGLL3 is also overexpressed in certain sarcomas, where it promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration, potentially through its interaction with TEAD transcription factors (Hélias‐Rodzewicz2010YAP1).

## Interactions
VGLL3 (vestigial like family member 3) is a transcriptional cofactor that interacts with TEAD transcription factors, specifically TEAD1, TEAD3, and TEAD4, to regulate various cellular processes. In the context of cancer cell proliferation, VGLL3 acts as a cofactor for TEADs and is involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. It associates with TEAD4, promoting cell growth by inhibiting the Hippo pathway, which leads to the inactivation of YAP/TAZ, key regulators of cell proliferation (Hori2020Vestigiallike).

In skeletal muscle development, VGLL3 interacts with TEAD1, TEAD3, and TEAD4, influencing myogenesis. It competes with YAP for binding to TEADs, suggesting a regulatory role in the Hippo signaling pathway. VGLL3 primarily acts as a repressor of gene expression in myoblasts, affecting the transcriptional activation of target genes (Figeac2019VGLL3).

In cardiac fibrosis, VGLL3 is identified as a mechanosensitive protein that promotes collagen production through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). It interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as RBM14, TDP-43, and NONO, forming nuclear puncta in cardiac myofibroblasts. These interactions are crucial for VGLL3's role in promoting fibrosis-related gene expression (Horii2023VGLL3).
