# MPV17L

## Overview
MPV17L is a gene that encodes the MPV17 mitochondrial inner membrane protein-like, a transmembrane protein primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a significant role in protecting cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis by interacting with the serine protease HtrA2 (also known as Omi) through a PDZ domain. The interaction is crucial for activating HtrA2, which in turn helps inhibit mitochondrial superoxide generation and stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential. MPV17L is predominantly expressed in the mitochondria of kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells and exists in two splice variants, l-Mpv17l and s-Mpv17l. The protein's expression is modulated by oxidative stress conditions, and its overexpression is associated with reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular health (Krick2008Mpv17l).

## Function
The MPV17L protein is a transmembrane protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in protecting against mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis. It interacts with the serine protease HtrA2 (also known as Omi) within mitochondria. This interaction is mediated by a PDZ domain, which activates the protease function of HtrA2. The activation of HtrA2 by MPV17L helps inhibit mitochondrial superoxide generation, stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, and prevent apoptosis (Krick2008Mpv17l). MPV17L is involved in reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and stabilizing mitochondrial function, which is essential for maintaining cellular health. In healthy cells, MPV17L is predominantly found in the mitochondria of kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells, specifically in the outer medulla and inner cortex (Krick2008Mpv17l). The protein exists in two splice variants, l-Mpv17l and s-Mpv17l, both associated with mitochondria. MPV17L overexpression reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis, while its silencing leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis. This protein is downregulated by inducers of mitochondrial ROS generation, such as high D-glucose, which leads to increased ROS and apoptosis, but antioxidants can prevent this downregulation (Krick2008Mpv17l).

## Interactions
MPV17L interacts with the serine protease HtrA2 (also known as Omi) within the mitochondria. This interaction is mediated by a PDZ domain, which is crucial for the activation of HtrA2 protease. The activation of HtrA2 by MPV17L inhibits mitochondrial superoxide generation, stabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential, and prevents apoptosis. The MPV17L-HtrA2 complex is essential for sensing mitochondrial oxidative stress and protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (Krick2008Mpv17l).

The interaction between MPV17L and HtrA2 is dependent on the protease activity of HtrA2, which is regulated by its PDZ domain. This complex formation helps retain cytochrome c and HtrA2 within the mitochondria, preventing apoptosis by stabilizing the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (Krick2008Mpv17l).

MPV17L also interacts with the PDZ domain protein HtrA2 through a PDZ binding motif, which is crucial for its protective function. This interaction prevents the translocation of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby reducing apoptosis. The PDZ binding motif of MPV17L is essential for forming a complex with HtrA2, conferring resistance against mitochondrial dysfunction induced by stressors like antimycin A (Krick2008Mpv17l).
