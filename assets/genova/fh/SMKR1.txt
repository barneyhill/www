# SMKR1

## Overview
SMKR1 is a gene that encodes the small lysine rich protein 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its abundance of lysine residues, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of SMKR1 are not fully elucidated, it has been identified as a primate-selective gene with specific expression in sperm and progenitor cells, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology (Ezran2022Mouse). In the context of cancer, SMKR1 has been associated with prognostic outcomes in colorectal cancer and identified as a marker in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential significance in oncology (Li2022Molecular; Kang2020SETDB1). Further research is necessary to clarify the molecular mechanisms and broader implications of SMKR1 in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SMKR1 gene, also known as small lysine rich protein 1, has been explored in various studies, particularly in the context of cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with Lynch syndrome (LS), SMKR1 has been identified as having a significant correlation with survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2022Molecular). This indicates that alterations in SMKR1 expression may impact patient outcomes in CRC, highlighting its clinical relevance in this context.

In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), specifically lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), SMKR1 has been identified as an ADC-specific marker gene. However, the study does not provide detailed information on the clinical significance of SMKR1 mutations or expression changes in this type of cancer (Kang2020SETDB1).

Additionally, SMKR1 is mentioned as a 'primate-selective' gene with poorly characterized functions, specific to sperm and progenitor cells, in a study using a mouse lemur transcriptomic atlas. This suggests that SMKR1 may have unique roles in primates, although its clinical implications remain unclear (Ezran2022Mouse). Overall, while SMKR1 is implicated in certain cancers, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance across different conditions.
