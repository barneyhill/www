# NIPAL4

## Overview
The NIPAL4 gene encodes the protein NIPA-like domain containing 4, commonly referred to as ichthyin, which is a transmembrane protein involved in magnesium transport. This protein is primarily expressed in the granular layer of the epidermis and plays a crucial role in skin barrier formation and maintenance. Structurally, ichthyin is characterized by nine transmembrane helices, which facilitate its function as a transporter. It is implicated in the synthesis and regulation of acylceramide, a vital lipid component of the skin's permeability barrier, and is thought to act as a receptor in the hepoxilin pathway, influencing lipid metabolism and skin homeostasis. Mutations in the NIPAL4 gene are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a condition marked by dry, scaly skin due to defects in the skin's permeability barrier (Honda2018Decreased; Wajid2009<i>NIPAL4Ichthyin<i>).

## Structure
The NIPAL4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the NIPA family, which is believed to function as a magnesium transporter. The protein is composed of 466 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa (Laadhar2019Identification). Structurally, the NIPAL4 protein includes nine transmembrane helices, forming a basket-shaped fold with a large substrate-binding cavity, indicative of its role in transport processes (Laadhar2019Identification). The protein's secondary structure is characterized by these transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as a membrane-associated transporter.

A notable feature of the NIPAL4 protein is its structural homology with G-protein coupled receptors, suggesting a complex tertiary structure that facilitates its role in cellular transport (Laadhar2019Identification). The protein's function may be affected by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

The NIPAL4 protein's structure is critical for its function, as mutations can lead to significant changes in its transport channel. For instance, the p.E178D mutation in the second transmembrane helix narrows the channel, potentially disrupting substrate transport and contributing to disease pathology (Laadhar2019Identification).

## Function
The NIPAL4 gene encodes a protein known as ichthyin, which is primarily active in the granular layer of the human epidermis. It is implicated in the formation of the skin barrier, particularly through its role in the synthesis and regulation of acylceramide, a crucial lipid component of the skin's permeability barrier (Honda2018Decreased; i&gt; NIPAL4Ichthyin&lt; Wajid2009&lt). NIPAL4 is suggested to function as a magnesium (Mg2+) transporter, which is essential for chromatin remodeling during keratinocyte differentiation. This process is necessary for the proper induction of genes involved in skin barrier formation, such as Krt1, Lor, Flg, Elovl1, and Dgat2 (Honda2018Decreased).

In healthy skin, NIPAL4 expression increases during keratinocyte differentiation, peaking in the stratum granulosum, where it supports the expression of keratinocyte differentiation-dependent genes (Honda2018Decreased). The protein is also thought to act as a membrane receptor for trioxilins A3 and B3, components of the hepoxilin pathway, which are involved in lipid metabolism and skin barrier homeostasis (Li2012The). Mutations in NIPAL4 can disrupt these processes, leading to conditions such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), characterized by dry, scaly skin (i&gt; NIPAL4Ichthyin&lt; Wajid2009&lt).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NIPAL4 gene are a significant cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of skin disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin. These mutations lead to defects in the skin's permeability barrier, primarily due to abnormalities in the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope (CLE) and cornified envelope (CE), which are essential for maintaining skin barrier function (Mauldin2018Cellular). The NIPAL4 gene is expressed in the granular layer of the epidermis and is crucial for normal lamellar body formation and skin barrier development (Wajid2009<i>NIPAL4Ichthyin<i>).

Clinical manifestations of NIPAL4 mutations include generalized ichthyosis with erythema, fine whitish scales, larger brownish scales, and palmoplantar keratoderma. There is significant clinical variability even among individuals with the same mutation, suggesting potential environmental influences (Wajid2009<i>NIPAL4Ichthyin<i>). In some cases, mutations in NIPAL4 have been associated with erythrokeratodermia variabilis-like phenotypes, expanding the clinical spectrum of conditions linked to this gene (Charfeddine2021Expanding).

Research using animal models, such as Nipal4 knockout mice, has shown that disruptions in this gene lead to impaired skin barrier function, characterized by increased transepidermal water loss and morphological abnormalities in the epidermis (Honda2018Decreased). These findings underscore the critical role of NIPAL4 in maintaining skin integrity and its involvement in the pathogenesis of ichthyosis.

## Interactions
NIPAL4, also known as ichthyin, is implicated in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier, particularly through its interactions with other proteins involved in lipid processing and skin barrier homeostasis. In the context of NIPAL4 mutations, there is a notable increase in the expression and colocalization of epidermal lipoxygenases, specifically 12R-LOX and eLOX-3, throughout the epidermis. These enzymes are functionally related and are involved in the hepoxilin pathway, which is crucial for skin barrier function (Li2012The). 

NIPAL4 is also suggested to interact with transglutaminase-1 (TGM1), as their colocalization is observed in the epidermis, indicating a potential common metabolic pathway essential for skin barrier homeostasis (Li2012The). The protein is proposed to function as a receptor for trioxilins A3 and B3, components of the hepoxilin pathway, which may influence its interactions with other proteins involved in lipid metabolism (i&gt; NIPAL4Ichthyin&lt; Wajid2009&lt). 

In NIPAL4-deficient canines, the protein's role as a magnesium transporter is highlighted, affecting the bioavailability of magnesium necessary for the activation of acyl-CoA synthase in FATP4, which impacts fatty acid metabolism and skin barrier integrity (Mauldin2018Cellular).
