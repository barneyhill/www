# C11orf52

## Overview
C11orf52 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 52. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including its potential involvement in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, although this association has not been experimentally confirmed (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). The protein is localized to focal adhesions, which are critical for cell adhesion and signaling, suggesting a role in cellular communication and structural integrity (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). C11orf52 is also predicted to function as an adapter protein or modulator within signaling pathways, interacting with proteins such as desmoglein 1 (DSG1), HRAS, and SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite these insights, the precise biological functions of C11orf52 remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its roles in cellular signaling and its potential implications in cancer and other diseases (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Function
C11orf52 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is associated with the 'canonical Wnt signaling pathway' as a biological process, although this has not been experimentally confirmed (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). The protein is localized to focal adhesions, which are cellular structures that connect the cell cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). This localization has been confirmed by the Human Protein Atlas (Hwang2020Bioinformatic).

C11orf52 is also potentially involved in the Wnt-signaling pathway, as indicated by its protein partners, including desmoglein 1 (DSG1) (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The subinteractome of C11orf52 contains HRAS, a gene frequently mutated in solid tumors, and SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), which is part of HRAS signaling, suggesting that C11orf52 may act as an adapter protein or modulator in these signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, the specific function of C11orf52 in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to clarify its roles in cellular signaling and potential involvement in cancer-associated pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf52 has been identified as having prognostic significance in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Lower expression levels of C11orf52 are associated with better survival outcomes, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 0.42 and a statistically significant log-rank p-value of 0.0023 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This suggests that alterations in the expression of C11orf52 may impact the progression and prognosis of UCEC.

The gene is also implicated in cancer-related signaling pathways. C11orf52 is suggested to be involved in the Wnt-signaling pathway through its interaction with desmoglein 1 (DSG1). Its subinteractome includes HRAS, a gene frequently mutated in solid tumors, and SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), which is part of HRAS signaling. This indicates that C11orf52 may function as an adapter protein or modulator in these pathways, potentially influencing cancer development and progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Research has also explored the potential diagnostic significance of C11orf52, with its peptide compositions identified in human blood plasma or urine samples, suggesting a role in cancer detection (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, the specific clinical significance of C11orf52 in other conditions remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
C11orf52 is involved in the Wnt-signaling pathway and interacts with desmoglein 1 (DSG1). Its subinteractome includes HRAS, a gene frequently mutated in solid tumors, and SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), which is part of HRAS signaling. This suggests that C11orf52 may function as an adapter protein or modulator within these signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). 

The protein is also predicted to be involved in intercellular communication and signaling functions, as it is identified as one of the secreted ORF proteins derived from urine samples (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Bioinformatic predictions have confirmed its involvement in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway with a high Cscore GO of 1.00, and its localization in focal adhesion has been experimentally confirmed (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). 

Despite these insights, specific physical interactions of C11orf52 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature. The need for further functional annotation and exploration of protein-protein interactions is emphasized to clarify the roles of C11orf52 in signaling pathways and its potential as a molecular target for pharmacological interventions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
