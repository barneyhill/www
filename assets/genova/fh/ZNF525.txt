# ZNF525

## Overview
ZNF525 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 525, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating gene expression. The ZNF525 protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression patterns that are crucial for cellular function and has been associated with several pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. Its expression levels have been linked to prognostic outcomes in various cancer types, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker for disease progression and therapeutic targeting (Sun2022Comprehensive; Machnik2019The).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF525 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression levels associated with prognosis and clinical outcomes. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZNF525 expression is highest in the squamoid subtype and correlates with smoking history. Lower expression levels in LUAD patients are linked to longer survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.83, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker (Machnik2019The). In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), high ZNF525 mRNA levels are associated with poor prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 1.6 (Machnik2019The).

In breast cancer, ZNF525 expression varies across DNA methylation clusters and is associated with shorter overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.8 (Machnik2019The). Its expression is notably higher in luminal B tumors and ER+ and PR+ tumors, suggesting a role in specific breast cancer subtypes (Machnik2019The).

ZNF525 is also part of a prognostic signature in osteosarcoma, where higher expression levels are linked to a high-risk group, although its expression was not directly related to prognosis in some analyses (Sun2022Comprehensive). These findings highlight ZNF525's potential as a biomarker in cancer prognosis.
