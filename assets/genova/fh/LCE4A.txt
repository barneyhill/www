# LCE4A

## Overview
LCE4A is a gene that encodes the protein late cornified envelope 4A, which is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family. This family of proteins is integral to the formation and maintenance of the skin's protective barrier, playing a significant role in the process of keratinization. The LCE4A protein is involved in the differentiation of keratinocytes, contributing to the formation of a robust structure beneath the cell membrane, which is crucial for skin barrier function and has implications in conditions such as psoriasis (Jeong2023A). Beyond its role in dermatological health, LCE4A has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Kumar2014Immunochip; Vicuña2019Adaptation). The gene's involvement in epigenetic regulation and protein-protein interaction networks further underscores its potential impact on diverse biological processes and disease mechanisms (Susymary2022Graph; Pradhan2013Systems).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LCE4A gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants in the LCE4A-C1orf68 locus are linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, which are characterized by impaired skin barrier function (Kumar2014Immunochip). These conditions may also increase the risk of bladder cancer, as the LCE4A-C1orf68 gene is implicated in the immune barrier function of epithelial tissues, potentially influencing carcinogenesis (Vicuña2019Adaptation).

The LCE4A gene is also associated with susceptibility to candidaemia, a serious fungal infection. Genetic studies have identified significant associations between SNPs in the LCE4A-C1orf68 locus and increased risk of candidaemia, suggesting that these genetic variations may affect the epithelial barrier function, which is crucial in preventing fungal colonization (Kumar2014Immunochip).

In the context of bladder cancer, mutations in the core promoter of LCE4A have been shown to decrease its expression, which may contribute to oncogenesis through altered cellular differentiation (Huang2022Core). Additionally, LCE4A has been implicated in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, with genetic variants potentially affecting visual outcomes in patients (Wang2023Exome).

## Interactions
LCE4A is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, which plays a crucial role in skin barrier formation and maintenance. This gene is involved in keratinization, a process essential for the formation of the skin's protective barrier. LCE4A, along with other LCE family members, contributes to the formation of a tough structure beneath the cell membrane during keratinocyte differentiation, which is significant in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Jeong2023A).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, LCE4A is identified as a hypomethylated gene on chromosome 1, specifically in Stage III of the disease. This suggests a potential role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during cancer progression, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Pradhan2013Systems).

LCE4A is also mentioned in studies analyzing protein-protein interaction networks related to COVID-19, where it is included in clusters associated with biological processes like keratinization. However, specific interaction details for LCE4A within these networks are not provided (Susymary2022Graph). Overall, while LCE4A is implicated in various biological processes, detailed information on its specific protein or nucleic acid interactions remains limited.
