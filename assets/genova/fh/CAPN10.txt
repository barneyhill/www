# CAPN10

## Overview
CAPN10 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 10, a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Unlike classical calpains, calpain 10 is an atypical monomeric enzyme that lacks the calmodulin-like Ca2+-binding domain, instead featuring a unique T-domain of unknown function (Turner2005Calpain10:). Calpain 10 is involved in various cellular processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, by influencing insulin secretion and glucose uptake through its interactions with proteins such as SNAREs and microtubule-associated proteins (Hatta2018Calpain10; Turner2005Calpain10:). The CAPN10 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have distinct functional roles (Kausar2013Identification). Genetic variations in CAPN10 have been associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic regulation (Pánico2014Role; Gonzalez2002CAPN10).

## Structure
Calpain-10 (CAPN10) is an atypical member of the calpain family, characterized by its unique structure as a four-domain monomer, unlike the typical heterodimeric calpains. It lacks the calmodulin-like Ca2+-binding domain found in classical calpains and instead features a T-domain of unknown function (Turner2005Calpain10:). CAPN10 has conserved amino acid sequences in domains I, II, and III, with domain III being a Ca2+-regulated phospholipid-binding domain capable of binding up to three Ca2+ ions, which may facilitate membrane binding and influence the enzyme's activation state (Turner2005Calpain10:).

The CAPN10 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in eight distinct isoforms (10a-10h), each potentially having different membrane-binding affinities and activation states (Turner2005Calpain10:). Isoforms b, d, and e share structural and domain homology with the canonical isoform a, while isoforms f and h are distinct, possessing only the catalytic cysteine protease domain and potentially exhibiting weaker protease activity (Kausar2013Identification). The presence of these isoforms suggests that CAPN10's activity may be regulated by both its membrane association and local Ca2+ concentration (Turner2005Calpain10:).

## Function
Calpain-10, encoded by the CAPN10 gene, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease involved in various cellular processes crucial for maintaining glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. In pancreatic β-cells, calpain-10 plays a significant role in insulin secretion by participating in the regulated secretory pathway. It affects glycolysis, ion channel activity, and Ca2+-dependent processes essential for insulin granule relocation and release (Turner2005Calpain10:). Calpain-10 also interacts with SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, facilitating insulin granule exocytosis through the proteolytic cleavage of SNAP-25 (Turner2005Calpain10:).

In adipocytes and skeletal muscle, calpain-10 is involved in the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane, a process critical for glucose uptake. This function is linked to its role in actin dynamics, as calpain-10 regulates the proteolysis of microtubule-associated protein 1b (MAP1B), affecting actin filament remodeling (Hatta2018Calpain10). Calpain-10's activity is also associated with mitochondrial function, influencing cellular energy balance and potentially impacting the development of type 2 diabetes (Turner2005Calpain10:). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, liver, and pancreas, indicating its broad role in cellular metabolism (Pánico2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAPN10 gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, most notably type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Variants such as SNP-43, SNP-44, and InDel-19 have been linked to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and altered lipid metabolism. The G allele of SNP-43 is associated with higher fasting plasma glucose levels and increased triglyceride levels, while SNP-44 is linked to impaired fasting glucose levels in hypertensive patients (Pánico2014Role). The InDel-19 2R/2R genotype is associated with higher HbA1C levels, indicating poor long-term glucose control (Pánico2014Role).

CAPN10 polymorphisms also interact with environmental factors, such as arsenic exposure, potentially leading to T2DM by impairing β-cell function (Pánico2014Role). Obesity is another condition associated with CAPN10, where certain alleles like SNP-44 C and InDel-19 2R/2R are linked to higher BMI (Pánico2014Role). CAPN10 is implicated in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with specific alleles increasing susceptibility to the condition and associated with higher cholesterol levels (Gonzalez2002CAPN10). These genetic variations contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemias, and cardiovascular diseases (Pánico2014Role).

## Interactions
Calpain 10 (CAPN10) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. CAPN10 interacts with microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), where it cleaves MAP1B into heavy and light chains, affecting their binding activities to microtubules and actin filaments. This interaction is crucial for regulating actin dynamics and is significant in the context of insulin secretion, as CAPN10 deficiency leads to increased insulin secretion due to abnormal actin reorganization (Hatta2018Calpain10).

CAPN10 also interacts with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 in β-cells, where it regulates insulin secretion through the proteolytic cleavage of SNAP-25. This interaction is calcium-dependent and is susceptible to pharmacological calpain inhibition, indicating a role in the modulation of insulin release (Turner2005Calpain10:).

Additionally, CAPN10 is involved in the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) during insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes, suggesting its role in glucose metabolism (SORIMACHI2011Calpain). These interactions highlight CAPN10's involvement in critical cellular pathways related to glucose metabolism and insulin signaling.
