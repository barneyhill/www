# RASSF4

## Overview
RASSF4 is a gene located on chromosome 10q11.21 that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 4, which is part of the Ras association domain family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Ras association (RA) domain and a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain, which are integral to its function in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in apoptosis and the Hippo signaling pathway (Richter2009The; van2007The). RASSF4 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and myogenic differentiation, and it interacts with several proteins such as MST1 and activated K-Ras, suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Chen2017RASSF4; Lin2019RASSF4). The expression of RASSF4 is often altered in cancer, where it can act as a tumor suppressor or, in certain contexts, as an oncogene, highlighting its potential significance in cancer biology and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Volodko2014RASSF; Lin2019RASSF4).

## Structure
RASSF4 is a protein encoded by the RASSF4 gene, located on chromosome 10q11.21. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Ras association (RA) domain and a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins and its role in apoptosis (Richter2009The; van2007The). The RA domain allows RASSF4 to bind directly to activated K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner, promoting apoptosis through caspase activation (Donninger2016Ras; van2007The). The SARAH domain facilitates interactions with downstream kinases like MST1, playing a role in the Hippo signaling pathway (Volodko2014RASSF; Lin2019RASSF4).

RASSF4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants, including RASSF4A, RASSF4B, and RASSF4C, which share identical C-terminal RA and SARAH domains but differ in their N-terminal exons (van2007The). The RASSF4A isoform is the most studied, producing a protein of 321 amino acids with approximately 60% identity to RASSF2 (van2007The). RASSF4 is broadly expressed in normal tissues but is often downregulated in tumor cells due to promoter methylation, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Richter2009The; Volodko2014RASSF).

## Function
RASSF4, a member of the Ras association domain family, plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. RASSF4 influences the translocation of the ER Ca2+ sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) to ER-PM junctions, which is crucial for SOCE, a fundamental Ca2+ signaling mechanism (Chen2017RASSF4). It also regulates the ER-PM tethering function of extended synaptotagmins E-Syt2 and E-Syt3, affecting the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane, essential for the localization of STIM1 and E-Syts at ER-PM junctions (Chen2017RASSF4).

RASSF4 interacts with adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a small G protein that regulates the localization and activation of type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIP5Ks) and PI(4,5)P2 production, thereby controlling SOCE and other PI(4,5)P2-dependent biological processes (Chen2017RASSF4). Additionally, RASSF4 is involved in myogenic differentiation, where it regulates microtubule reorganization and myoblast elongation, essential for skeletal muscle differentiation (Lin2019RASSF4).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF4 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In many tumors, RASSF4 expression is downregulated, often due to promoter hypermethylation, which is observed in breast, lung, colorectal, and kidney cancers. This downregulation is associated with tumorigenesis, as RASSF4 acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell growth (Volodko2014RASSF; van2007The). However, in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), RASSF4 is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting senescence, suggesting an oncogenic role in this context (Donninger2016Ras; Lin2019RASSF4).

RASSF4 interacts with the tumor suppressor MST1, inhibiting the Hippo pathway, which can lead to enhanced cell growth and bypass of senescence in certain cancers (Volodko2014RASSF; Zinatizadeh2019The). Its expression is also elevated in some breast cancers, indicating a complex role in cancer biology where it may act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the cellular context (Zinatizadeh2019The). The gene's involvement in cancer progression highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
RASSF4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is known to associate with MST1 (also known as STK4), a kinase involved in the Hippo signaling pathway and tumor suppression. This interaction occurs through their SARAH domains and has been confirmed in differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMMs) using coimmunopurification techniques. The interaction between RASSF4 and MST1 is crucial for skeletal muscle differentiation, as MST1 activity is necessary for this process (Lin2019RASSF4).

RASSF4 also binds directly to activated K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via its RA domain. This interaction suggests a role in mediating cell death, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor by antagonizing the pro-proliferative signals of RAS (Richter2009The; van2007The). The binding of RASSF4 to activated KRAS stimulates RASSF4-mediated cell death, highlighting its involvement in apoptosis (Richter2009The).

In some cancer contexts, RASSF4 interacts with MST1 to inhibit the Hippo pathway, resulting in enhanced cell growth and bypass of senescence, indicating its diverse biological effects in different cell systems (Donninger2016Ras).
