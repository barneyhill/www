# ACLY

## Overview
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a gene that encodes the enzyme ATP citrate lyase, a crucial component in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a lyase and plays a pivotal role in the conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, a reaction that is essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as for protein acetylation processes (Zhao2016ATPCitrate; Dominguez2021Exploring). ACLY is highly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue, where it supports cell growth and proliferation by providing acetyl-CoA for membrane biosynthesis (Chypre2012ATPcitrate). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its stability and function (Dominguez2021Exploring). ACLY's involvement in metabolic pathways and its regulation by nutrient availability underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Zhao2016ATPCitrate; Dominguez2021Exploring).

## Structure
The human ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) protein is a key enzyme in carbon metabolism, primarily responsible for converting citrate into acetyl-CoA. ACLY functions as a homotetramer, forming a stable structure composed of four identical subunits, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Bazilevsky2019ATPcitrate). The protein consists of two major superdomains: the N-terminal acyl-CoA synthetase superfamily domain (SCS superdomain) and the C-terminal citrate synthase homology domain (CSHD) (Bazilevsky2019ATPcitrate).

The CSHD is crucial for maintaining the tetrameric structure and is necessary for CoA binding, stability, and catalysis. It interacts with the SCS superdomain, facilitating CoA substrate binding (Bazilevsky2019ATPcitrate). The multimerization of ACLY, driven by the CSHD, provides structural stability and enables novel chemistry at the association interface (Bazilevsky2019ATPcitrate). The enzyme's activity requires cooperation between the N- and C-terminal domains, as the loss of the CSHD nullifies acetyl-CoA production (Bazilevsky2019ATPcitrate).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination regulate ACLY, although their specific roles in the context of the CSHD remain largely uncharacterized (Bazilevsky2019ATPcitrate). The study of ACLY's structure and function suggests potential for developing novel modulators for therapeutic purposes.

## Function
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a pivotal enzyme in human cells, catalyzing the conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in both the cytosol and nucleus. This reaction is essential for the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as for the acetylation of proteins, including histones, which links cellular metabolism to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (Zhao2016ATPCitrate; Dominguez2021Exploring). ACLY is highly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue, and it plays a significant role in supporting cell growth and proliferation by providing acetyl-CoA for membrane biosynthesis (Chypre2012ATPcitrate; Dominguez2021Exploring).

ACLY is also involved in nutrient sensing, influencing glucose-induced insulin secretion and supporting glycolysis by providing NAD+ (Dominguez2021Exploring). Its activity is regulated through phosphorylation and acetylation, which affect its stability and function (Dominguez2021Exploring). In the immune system, ACLY is crucial for the metabolic switch in T lymphocytes from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis upon activation, supporting rapid cell growth and division (Dominguez2021Exploring). The enzyme's role in histone acetylation is particularly important, as it affects gene expression in response to nutrient availability, potentially influencing metabolic diseases and cancer (Zhao2016ATPCitrate; Dominguez2021Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ACLY gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, ACLY is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth and survival by enhancing lipid synthesis and energy production. This overexpression is observed in various cancers, including lung, prostate, bladder, breast, liver, stomach, and colon cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer, high levels of phosphorylated ACLY are associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis (Migita2008ATP). ACLY's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which stabilizes ACLY protein through phosphorylation, promoting tumor progression (Migita2008ATP).

In metabolic disorders, ACLY is implicated in conditions such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Dysregulation of ACLY contributes to increased lipid synthesis, exacerbating these conditions. Clinical trials with ACLY inhibitors, like bempedoic acid, have shown promise in reducing LDL-cholesterol levels and improving metabolic risk factors associated with ASCVD and NAFLD (Pinkosky2017Targeting). Genetic variations in the ACLY gene region are linked to altered lipid levels and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (Feng2020ATPcitrate). These findings highlight ACLY as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) interacts with various proteins that regulate its activity and stability. ACLY is acetylated by the acetyltransferase PCAF at lysine residues K540, K546, and K554, which stabilizes the protein by preventing its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. This acetylation is enhanced under high glucose conditions, reducing the interaction with the E3 ligase UBR4, which targets ACLY for degradation (Lin2013Acetylation). SIRT2, a deacetylase, interacts with ACLY to decrease its acetylation, thereby increasing its ubiquitylation and destabilizing the protein. High glucose levels reduce the interaction between ACLY and SIRT2, leading to increased ACLY stability (Lin2013Acetylation).

ACLY is also phosphorylated by protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) at serine 454, a modification that is stimulated by insulin and isoproterenol. This phosphorylation event is part of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and is crucial for ACLY's role in metabolic processes (Berwick2002The). ACLY interacts with the catalytic subunit of AMPK, which suppresses AMPK's function, and with MORC2, which regulates its phosphorylation and enzymatic activity (Khwairakpam2019The). These interactions highlight ACLY's involvement in key cellular processes, including lipid biosynthesis and tumor growth.
