# GALNT2

## Overview
The GALNT2 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2), a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation. This enzyme is responsible for transferring N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on target proteins, a modification that is crucial for protein folding, stability, and function (Fritz2006Dynamic; Antonucci2022Role). The GALNT2 protein is characterized by a catalytic domain and a C-terminal ricin B-type lectin domain, which together facilitate substrate recognition and enhance glycosylation efficiency (Fritz2006Dynamic). GALNT2 is involved in various biological processes, including lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as congenital disorders of glycosylation and certain cancers (Antonucci2022Role; Wu2011Mucin). Its broad substrate specificity and involvement in critical metabolic pathways underscore its significance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis (Marucci2019GALNT2).

## Structure
The GALNT2 protein, encoded by the GALNT2 gene, is a type II transmembrane protein involved in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation. It features a catalytic domain with a GT1 fold and a C-terminal ricin B-type lectin domain, which is unique among glycosyltransferases (Fritz2006Dynamic; Gómez2014A). The catalytic domain spans residues 74-440 and is responsible for transferring N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine residues on peptide substrates (Fritz2006Dynamic). The lectin domain plays a crucial role in recognizing and binding glycopeptide substrates, enhancing the enzyme's efficiency in glycosylation (Fritz2006Dynamic).

The protein's structure includes key residues such as Thr 143, Asp 176, Arg 201, Asp 224, His 226, and His 359, which are involved in UDP binding and coordinate with a Mn2+ ion (Fritz2006Dynamic). The enzyme's tertiary structure is characterized by a dynamic association between the catalytic and lectin domains, which is essential for its function (Fritz2006Dynamic). GALNT2 may undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its structure and function (Gómez2014A).

## Function
The GALNT2 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2), which plays a crucial role in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification that significantly influences protein folding, stability, and function (Antonucci2022Role; Marucci2013GALNT2). GALNT2 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it affects a wide range of proteins due to its broad substrate specificity, contributing to protein diversity and function across various tissues (Antonucci2022Role).

In healthy human cells, GALNT2 is involved in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. It modulates the glycosylation of proteins such as ANGPTL3 and ApoC-III, which are important for triglyceride clearance, and influences the function of membrane receptors involved in energy metabolism and cell growth (Antonucci2022Role). GALNT2 also plays a role in adipogenesis, enhancing the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes and positively influencing insulin signaling by down-regulating ENPP1, an inhibitor of insulin receptor function (Marucci2019GALNT2). These activities suggest that GALNT2 is integral to maintaining metabolic health and regulating body weight (Antonucci2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALNT2 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting lipid metabolism and developmental processes. Loss-of-function mutations in GALNT2 have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (Kato2021Polypeptide). Patients with GALNT2 mutations often exhibit short stature, psychomotor and developmental disabilities, dysmorphic facial features, epilepsy, autistic behavior, and chronic insomnia. These individuals also show completely aglycosylated ApoC-III and decreased HDL-C levels, indicating significant metabolic abnormalities (Ondruskova2021Congenital).

Variants in GALNT2, such as rs4846913-A, are associated with altered glycosylation of apolipoprotein C-III (apo-CIII), impacting triglyceride levels and potentially influencing the risk of type 2 diabetes (Naber2023ApolipoproteinCIII). In mouse models, mutations in GALNT2 have been linked to otitis media, a condition characterized by middle ear inflammation and hearing loss, due to dysregulated mucosa proliferation and chronic inflammation (Ma2023Role). These findings underscore the gene's role in various biological processes and its potential impact on human health.

## Interactions
GALNT2, a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions through its role in O-glycosylation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GALNT2 interacts with the glycoprotein ITGA5, modifying its O-glycosylation. This interaction is significant as ITGA5 acts as a downstream effector of GALNT2, influencing tumor growth and cell behaviors (Hu2022The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GALNT2 modifies the glycosylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), affecting its activity. This modification alters the expression of short O-glycans on EGFR, impacting its phosphorylation and subsequent signaling pathways (Wu2011Mucin). GALNT2's interaction with EGFR is crucial in regulating malignant behaviors in HCC cells, as demonstrated by changes in cell growth, migration, and invasion upon GALNT2 knockdown (Wu2011Mucin).

GALNT2 also plays a role in lipid metabolism by glycosylating proteins such as apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III) and angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). These interactions influence lipoprotein lipase activity and plasma triglyceride levels, highlighting GALNT2's involvement in metabolic processes (Naber2023ApolipoproteinCIII; Kato2021Polypeptide).
