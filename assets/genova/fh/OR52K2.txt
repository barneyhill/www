# OR52K2

## Overview
OR52K2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily K member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the sense of smell (Yin2020Functional). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR52K2 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, indicating potential roles in other physiological processes, including reproductive biology and immune response (Li2024RNA; Melo2017Genomewide). The gene has also been implicated in genetic variations affecting hemoglobin levels and thromboembolic risk, particularly in the context of sickle cell disease (Alshabeeb2023Impact). Despite its diverse expression and potential roles, the full spectrum of OR52K2's functions in human health and disease remains to be comprehensively understood.

## Structure


## Function
OR52K2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules, primarily functioning within the olfactory transduction pathway. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). While its primary activity is in the olfactory epithelium, OR52K2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction.

In the context of reproductive biology, OR52K2 is expressed in primordial germ cells and unfertilized human oocytes, indicating a possible involvement in gamete production and reproductive success (Melo2017Genomewide). The gene's expression in macrophages and its participation in inflammatory responses have been noted, with potential implications for diagnostic markers in bacterial meningitis (Li2024RNA).

Additionally, OR52K2 has been associated with genetic variations that may influence hemoglobin levels and thromboembolic risk in sickle cell disease, suggesting a broader role in modulating physiological processes beyond olfaction (Alshabeeb2023Impact). Despite these findings, the specific molecular functions of OR52K2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
