# TLL1

## Overview
TLL1, or tolloid-like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the astacin family of metalloproteases, which are zinc-dependent enzymes involved in the processing of extracellular matrix components and signaling molecules. The protein encoded by TLL1 is characterized by a complex domain structure, including a metalloprotease domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB) domains, which facilitate its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Ge2006Mammalian). TLL1 plays a pivotal role in cardiac development and bone formation by modulating the activity of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and processing procollagen substrates (Sieron2019Functional). Mutations in the TLL1 gene have been linked to congenital heart defects, such as atrial septal defect 6 (ASD6), highlighting its clinical significance in developmental biology and pathology (Sieron2019Functional).

## Structure
The TLL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the astacin family of metalloproteases, characterized by a conserved domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a metalloprotease domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB) domains (Ge2006Mammalian). The metalloprotease domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, while the EGF-like and CUB domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and substrate binding (Ge2006Mammalian).

The primary structure of TLL1 includes specific amino acid sequences that allow for post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and cleavage of the propeptide, which are essential for its maturation and function (Ge2006Mammalian). The secondary structure of TLL1, as analyzed by circular dichroism spectrometry, includes α-helices, β-sheets, and random coil structures, which contribute to its overall stability and function (Sieron2019Functional).

TLL1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its domain composition and functional properties (Ge2006Mammalian). The protein's tertiary structure is influenced by the folding of its domains, which is critical for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins, such as procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein 1 (PCOLCE1) (Ge2006Mammalian). The quaternary structure, if present, involves the formation of complexes with other proteins, enhancing its functional roles in extracellular matrix formation and signaling pathways (Ge2006Mammalian).

## Function
The TLL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidase family, playing a crucial role in the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and various signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, TLL1 is involved in the processing of substrates such as procollagen types I, II, and VII, which are essential for ECM structure and intercellular signaling (Sieron2019Functional). The protein functions by cleaving chordin, a protein that binds to bone morphogenetic proteins BMP2 and BMP4, releasing these morphogens to interact with cell surface receptors. This interaction is important for processes like the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the differentiation of progenitor cells into cardiomyocytes (Sieron2019Functional).

TLL1 is active in the extracellular space, where it influences cardiac development and bone formation. It is particularly crucial for heart development, as it regulates BMP2/4 signaling, which is essential for the formation of heart septa (Sieron2019Functional). Mutations in TLL1 can lead to heart defects, such as atrial-septal defect 6 (ASD6), due to altered enzymatic activity and substrate binding properties (Sieron2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TLL1 gene are associated with several congenital heart defects, most notably atrial septal defect 6 (ASD6). TLL1 is a zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidase crucial for heart development, particularly in the formation of heart septa. Specific mutations, such as M182L, V238A, and I629V, have been linked to ASD6, a condition characterized by defects in the heart's septal formation. These mutations impair the enzyme's activity, structure, and substrate binding properties, leading to defective cleavage of chordin and procollagen I, which are essential for proper heart development (Sieron2019Functional).

In addition to ASD6, other mutations in TLL1 have been identified in patients with atrial septal defects. For example, a de novo splicing variant in TLL1 was found in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and ASD secundum, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Alanzi2019A). The absence of TLL1 in transgenic mice results in severe blood circulation failure, underscoring its critical role in heart development (Stańczak2008Mutations).

Furthermore, induced ablation of TLL1 in mice has been shown to result in osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by brittle bones, indicating that TLL1 also plays a significant role in bone development and integrity (Muir2014Induced).

## Interactions
TLL1 (tolloid-like 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. TLL1 binds to procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein 1 (PCOLCE1), which enhances its procollagen C-proteinase (pCP) activities. This interaction is dependent on the COOH-terminal CUB and/or EGF domains of TLL1, as truncated forms lacking these domains do not bind PCOLCE1 (Ge2006Mammalian). TLL1 also interacts with chordin, a substrate involved in BMP signaling. The binding kinetics of TLL1 and its mutants with chordin have been studied, showing that mutations can reduce the binding affinity and enzymatic activity of TLL1 (Sieron2019Functional).

TLL1 is known to process several substrates, including procollagen types I, II, and VII, as well as other molecules like lysyl pro-oxydase, osteoglycine, decorin, probiglycan, and perlecan. These interactions are significant for extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and heart development (Sieron2019Functional). Additionally, TLL1's activity is modulated by calcium levels, particularly in its interactions with substrates like probiglycan and chordin, where calcium can influence its enzymatic activity (Ge2006Mammalian). These interactions highlight TLL1's role in tissue development and remodeling.
