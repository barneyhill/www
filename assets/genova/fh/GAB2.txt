# GAB2

## Overview
GAB2 (GRB2 associated binding protein 2) is a gene that encodes a scaffolding adaptor protein involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. The protein, also referred to as GAB2, plays a pivotal role in mediating signals from receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), through pathways like PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. As a scaffolding protein, GAB2 facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes by interacting with multiple proteins, including those containing SH2 and SH3 domains, thereby influencing cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Meng2005Participation; Caron2009Nonredundant). The protein's involvement in critical cellular processes extends to roles in immune responses, neuronal differentiation, and bone homeostasis (Wöhrle2009Function; Gu2003The). GAB2's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where it is implicated in tumor progression and neuroprotection, respectively (Matsumura2014Clinical; Zou2013Linking).

## Structure
GAB2 (GRB2 associated binding protein 2) is a scaffold protein involved in signal transduction pathways. It contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus, which is crucial for membrane recruitment by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) in the plasma membrane (Wöhrle2009Function; Yin2024An). The central region of GAB2 is proline-rich, facilitating interactions with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2 (Wöhrle2009Function; Yin2024An). 

GAB2 also features multiple tyrosine residues that undergo phosphorylation, enabling interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins like SHP2, Crk, and the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85 (Yin2024An; Osinalde2016Changes). Phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues, such as S210 and T391, modulates interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, which can influence the recruitment of other signaling molecules (Wöhrle2009Function; Osinalde2016Changes).

The protein's structure allows it to act as a platform for assembling signaling complexes, integrating and amplifying signals from various receptors (Wöhrle2009Function). While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available sources, the functional domains and phosphorylation sites are well-characterized.

## Function
GAB2 (GRB2 associated binding protein 2) is a scaffolding adaptor protein involved in various intracellular signaling pathways crucial for cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It plays a significant role in mediating signals from receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), through pathways like PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK (Meng2005Participation; Caron2009Nonredundant).

In healthy human cells, GAB2 is involved in the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, particularly in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. It forms complexes with SHP2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is essential for ERK activation and cell migration (Meng2005Participation). GAB2 also participates in PI3K activation, which is crucial for various cellular responses, including mast cell degranulation and cytokine secretion, highlighting its role in immune responses (Gu2003The).

GAB2 is expressed in neuronal tissues, where it contributes to neuronal differentiation and survival through PI3K and MEK-dependent pathways (Wöhrle2009Function). It is also involved in bone homeostasis by regulating RANK signaling, affecting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption (Wöhrle2009Function). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, GAB2 is not essential for viability, as Gab2-deficient mice are viable but exhibit specific phenotypes (Wöhrle2009Function).

## Clinical Significance
GAB2 (GRB2 associated binding protein 2) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in intracellular signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GAB2 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High GAB2 expression is associated with malignancy indicators such as lymphatic and venous invasion, liver metastasis, and lower survival rates in patients. It is considered a significant risk factor for lymph node metastasis in CRC, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Matsumura2014Clinical).

In Alzheimer's disease, GAB2 variants have been linked to a protective effect against late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Increased GAB2 expression in certain brain regions correlates with decreased neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque counts, indicating a potential protective role against Alzheimer's pathology (Zou2013Linking; Reiman2007GAB2).

GAB2 is also overexpressed in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, gastric, and melanoma. In melanoma, GAB2 amplifications are associated with tumor growth and metastasis, particularly in subtypes arising from sun-protected sites. This overexpression is linked to enhanced cell proliferation and migration, highlighting GAB2's role in cancer progression (Wöhrle2009Function; Chernoff2009GAB2).

## Interactions
GAB2 (GRB2 associated binding protein 2) is a scaffolding protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. It interacts with SH2 domain-containing proteins such as SHP2, PI3K, and CrkL. The interaction with SHP2 is mediated by tyrosine residue Y614, while PI3K interaction involves tyrosines Y452, Y476, and Y584 (Crouin2001A). GAB2 also associates with the p85 subunit of PI3K, SHP2, and CrkL, facilitating downstream signaling pathways like MAPK and PI3K/AKT (Liu2001Scaffolding).

Upon interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation, GAB2 becomes phosphorylated, enhancing its interaction with proteins such as PTPN11 and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase (PIK3R1 and PIK3R2) (Osinalde2016Changes). Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as S210 and T391, regulates GAB2's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which mediate negative feedback by limiting its signaling potential (Brummer2008Phosphorylationdependent). The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to GAB2 promotes its dissociation from Grb2, thereby terminating signaling (Bier2015Small‐Molecule).

GAB2's interactions are critical for its role in cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival, by modulating various signaling pathways.
