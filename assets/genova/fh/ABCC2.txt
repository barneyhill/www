# ABCC2

## Overview
The ABCC2 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (MRP2), a transmembrane protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP2 plays a pivotal role in the cellular efflux of a variety of substrates, including drugs and organic anions, contributing to detoxification and chemoprotection processes in the body. It is predominantly expressed in the apical membranes of polarized cells such as hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and enterocytes, where it facilitates the ATP-dependent transport of conjugated organic anions out of cells (Nies2006The; Jedlitschky2006Structure). The protein's structure, characterized by two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, is essential for its function in substrate transport and is influenced by various protein interactions and post-translational modifications (Fan2024Structural; Jedlitschky2006Structure). Mutations in the ABCC2 gene are clinically significant, as they are associated with conditions such as Dubin-Johnson syndrome and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, highlighting the gene's importance in human health (Sun2024ABCC2p.R393W; Sookoian2008Association).

## Structure
The ABCC2 gene encodes the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP2 is characterized by a complex structure that includes two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Fan2024Structural; Wang2021Multidrug). The protein also features an additional N-terminal transmembrane domain, TMD0, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and subcellular targeting, although it is not directly involved in substrate transport (Fan2024Structural; Fernández2002Role).

MRP2 contains a core segment with two cytosolic NBDs and two membrane-spanning domains, along with a linker segment L1. The NBDs are functionally nonequivalent, with NBD1 having a higher ATP binding affinity, while NBD2 has a higher capacity for ATP hydrolysis (Jedlitschky2006Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability and localization to the apical membrane (Fernández2002Role; Jedlitschky2006Structure).

MRP2 is involved in the efflux of various substrates, including conjugated organic anions, across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, playing a significant role in drug disposition and detoxification (Nies2006The; Jedlitschky2006Structure). The protein's structure and function are influenced by specific domains and interactions, highlighting its importance in multidrug resistance and cellular transport processes.

## Function
The ABCC2 gene encodes the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), an ATP-binding cassette transporter that plays a crucial role in detoxification and chemoprotection in healthy human cells. MRP2 is primarily expressed in the apical membranes of polarized cells, such as hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and enterocytes, where it facilitates the transport of a wide range of organic anions and drugs out of cells (Nies2006The; Jedlitschky2006Structure). This protein is involved in the ATP-dependent efflux of substances conjugated with glutathione, glucuronate, or sulfate, including bilirubin glucuronides, leukotriene C4, and various drugs (Nies2006The).

MRP2's function is essential for the hepatobiliary excretion of anionic conjugates, contributing to bile flow and the elimination of endogenous and exogenous compounds (Nies2006The). It plays a significant role in the detoxification processes by transporting conjugated bilirubin and other metabolites, preventing their accumulation in cells and thereby protecting against potential toxicity (Nies2006The; Jedlitschky2006Structure). The protein's activity is regulated by nuclear receptors and can be influenced by various compounds, which modulate its expression and function (Nies2006The; Choudhuri2006Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCC2 gene, which encodes the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), are associated with Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This condition arises from defects in the transport of conjugated bilirubin from hepatocytes into bile, leading to its accumulation in the body. Specific mutations, such as p.R393W and p.L1211P, have been identified as contributing to DJS by affecting the expression and localization of the MRP2 protein. The p.R393W variant leads to a significant reduction in MRP2 expression due to accelerated proteasomal degradation, while the p.L1211P variant reduces membrane expression without affecting total protein levels (Sun2024ABCC2p.R393W).

Other mutations, such as W709R and R1310X, have been found in patients with DJS, resulting in impaired protein maturation and function. These mutations disrupt normal MRP2 processing and localization, contributing to the pathogenesis of the syndrome (Uchiumi2012Mutation). Additionally, ABCC2 gene variants have been linked to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), with certain SNPs like rs3740066 showing a significant association with the condition (Sookoian2008Association).

## Interactions
ABCC2, also known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), is involved in several protein interactions that influence its localization and function. Radixin, a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family, is crucial for the apical localization of ABCC2. In radixin knock-out mice, the absence of radixin results in the loss of ABCC2 from the hepatocyte canalicular membrane, leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, indicating that radixin is essential for maintaining ABCC2 at the apical membrane (Nies2006The).

ABCC2 also interacts with proteins from the PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) family, which bind to C termini with a conserved sequence. PDZK1 is one such protein that interacts with ABCC2. However, its interaction may not be essential in vivo, as PDZK1 knock-out mice still exhibit proper apical localization of ABCC2 in kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells, suggesting that other PDZ proteins might compensate for the absence of PDZK1 (Nies2006The).

The exact molecular mechanisms of how ABCC2 is targeted to the apical membrane remain incompletely understood. Some studies suggest that the PDZ-binding motif serves as the apical targeting signal, although this has not been consistently confirmed across all research (Nies2006The).
