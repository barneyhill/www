# OTOP1

## Overview
The OTOP1 gene encodes the protein otopetrin 1, which is a member of the otopetrin family and functions as a proton-selective ion channel. This protein is integral to various physiological processes, particularly in the vestibular system of the inner ear, where it is essential for the formation and maintenance of otoconia, calcium carbonate crystals crucial for balance and spatial orientation (Tu2018An; Kim2010Regulation). Otopetrin 1 is characterized by a unique structural configuration of twelve transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a pseudo-tetrameric structure as a dimer, which is distinct from typical ion channels (Teng2022Structural). Beyond its role in the inner ear, OTOP1 is also expressed in taste receptor cells, contributing to proton conductance and sensory perception (Tu2018An; Tian2023Vertebrate). Mutations in the OTOP1 gene are linked to vestibular disorders and hearing impairments, highlighting its clinical significance (lee2024OTOP1:; Hurle2003Nonsyndromic).

## Structure
The OTOP1 protein is part of the otopetrin family and functions as a proton channel. It is characterized by a unique molecular structure comprising twelve transmembrane alpha-helices organized into two homologous six-helix domains, forming a pseudo-tetrameric structure as a dimer (Teng2022Structural). This arrangement is distinct from typical ion channels, as the central cavity is filled with cholesterol-like molecules, which prevent ion conduction (Teng2022Structural).

The protein includes specific extracellular loops, notably the S5-S6 and S11-S12 loops, which are crucial for its function. The S5-S6 loop contains the residue H229, essential for proton sensing, while the S11-S12 loop, with residue D570, is vital for proton permeation (Li2022The). These loops contribute to the negative electric surface potential at the top of the C pore, attracting protons (Li2022The).

The structural model of OTOP1 suggests the presence of three putative proton-conducting pathways located in the N domain, C domain, and intrasubunit interface, which may cooperate or form a single conducting pathway (Li2022The). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by specific charged residues, which play a role in proton sensing and conductance (Li2022The).

## Function
The OTOP1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a proton-selective ion channel, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, particularly in the vestibular system of the inner ear. This protein is essential for the formation and maintenance of otoconia, which are calcium carbonate crystals necessary for balance and spatial orientation (Tu2018An; Kim2010Regulation). OTOP1 is involved in regulating intracellular calcium levels by modulating purinergic signaling pathways. It inhibits P2Y receptor activity, affecting calcium release from intracellular stores and facilitating the influx of extracellular calcium, which is vital for otoconia mineralization (Hughes2007Otopetrin; Kim2010Regulation).

In addition to its role in the inner ear, OTOP1 is expressed in taste receptor cells, where it contributes to proton conductance and is involved in acid-base balance and sensory perception (Tu2018An; Tian2023Vertebrate). The protein's activity is influenced by changes in extracellular pH, being activated by both acidic and alkaline conditions, which suggests its involvement in pH regulation and chemical sensation (Tian2023Vertebrate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTOP1 gene are associated with non-syndromic vestibular disorders, primarily due to otoconial agenesis, which affects balance and spatial orientation. In mice, mutations such as the tilted (tlt) and mergulhador (mlh) alleles lead to the absence of otoconia, resulting in balance impairments and behaviors like head tilting and swimming difficulties (Hurle2003Nonsyndromic). These mutations cause non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domains of the OTOP1 protein, disrupting its normal function (Hurle2003Nonsyndromic).

In humans, the OTOP1 gene has been implicated in vestibular dysfunction and hearing impairments. The gene is located near loci associated with these conditions, suggesting it as a candidate gene for such disorders (Hurle2003Nonsyndromic). Additionally, the Arg598Pro mutation in OTOP1 may destabilize the protein structure, affecting its proton transport activity, which could lead to functional impairments similar to those observed in animal models (lee2024OTOP1:).

Alterations in OTOP1 expression have also been linked to obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. In obese mice, increased expression of OTOP1 in white adipose tissue is associated with reduced inflammation and improved metabolic homeostasis, suggesting a protective role against obesity-induced metabolic disorders (Wang2014Otopetrin).

## Interactions
OTOP1 (otopetrin 1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the transcription factor STAT1 in adipocytes. OTOP1 physically interacts with STAT1, independent of its phosphorylation state, and this interaction attenuates interferon-gamma (IFN-g) signaling. This is evidenced by the elevated levels of IFN-g target genes in Otop1 mutant adipocytes compared to wild-type controls. The interaction between OTOP1 and STAT1 reduces both total and phosphorylated STAT1 levels, thereby dampening the expression of IFN-g target genes, which suggests a role for OTOP1 in modulating inflammatory signaling in adipose tissue (Wang2014Otopetrin).

In the context of calcium regulation, OTOP1 modulates purinergic signaling by inhibiting P2Y receptor activity, which affects calcium release from intracellular stores. This modulation is crucial for preventing ectopic mineralization in the inner ear (Kim2010Regulation). OTOP1 may also interact with P2X receptors or other proteins to facilitate extracellular calcium influx, which is important for otoconia mineralization (Kim2010Regulation). These interactions highlight OTOP1's role in calcium trafficking and regulation in the maculae.
