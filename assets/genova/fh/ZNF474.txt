# ZNF474

## Overview
ZNF474 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 474, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 474 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and the modulation of signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of ZNF474 remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma and early lung carcinogenesis, through its role as a transcription factor (Li2023Clinical; Pyatnitskiy2024TranscriptLevel). Further research is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms by which ZNF474 influences these diseases and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF474 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential mutations. In bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), ZNF474 is part of a risk signature developed to predict patient prognosis. High expression of ZNF474 is associated with interactions between taste transduction and focal adhesion pathways, and a lower risk score, which includes ZNF474, correlates with better survival outcomes (Li2023Clinical). Despite its inclusion in the risk model, ZNF474 has not been clearly associated with cancer in existing literature, indicating a need for further investigation into its molecular mechanisms (Li2023Clinical).

In the context of early lung carcinogenesis, ZNF474 is identified as a transcription factor co-regulating cilium-related processes, although its specific clinical significance in this area is not detailed (Pyatnitskiy2024TranscriptLevel). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), ZNF474 is enriched in groups without perineural invasion, but it does not have significant prognostic relevance in multivariate analyses (Kuk2024Prognostic). Additionally, ZNF474 is associated with a locus linked to lacunar stroke, though its specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Traylor2021Genetic).
