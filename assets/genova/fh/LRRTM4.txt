# LRRTM4

## Overview
LRRTM4, or leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) family. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat domains, which are integral to its role as a synaptic adhesion protein in the central nervous system (Agosto2020LRRTM4). The LRRTM4 protein is involved in the development and function of synapses, particularly in the hippocampus and retina, where it plays a critical role in organizing excitatory synapses (Roppongi2020LRRTMs). Unlike some other members of the LRRTM family, LRRTM4 does not bind to neurexins, instead interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as glypicans and syndecans, which are essential for its synaptogenic activity (karimi2014assessing; Yamagata2018Structural). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Clarke2021LRRTM4).

## Structure
LRRTM4 is a member of the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) protein family, characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These domains form a curved solenoid structure, which facilitates diverse protein interaction interfaces (Agosto2020LRRTM4). The protein consists of an extracellular N-terminal domain containing LRRs, a single transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Agosto2020LRRTM4). The LRR domain is crucial for its synaptogenic activity, allowing LRRTM4 to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) such as glypicans and syndecans, which are essential for its function in synapse development (karimi2014assessing).

LRRTM4 does not bind to neurexins like some other LRRTM family members, highlighting its unique binding specificity (Yamagata2018Structural). The protein is expressed in various brain regions, including the dentate gyrus granule cells, and is involved in both excitatory and inhibitory synapse regulation (karimi2014assessing; Sinha2020LRRTM4:). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence its stability and function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The existence of different isoforms due to alternative splicing is suggested, which may affect its structural and functional roles (Sinha2020LRRTM4:).

## Function
LRRTM4 (leucine rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 4) is a synaptic adhesion protein that plays a crucial role in synapse development and function in the central nervous system. It is primarily involved in the organization of excitatory synapses, particularly in the hippocampus and retina. LRRTM4 interacts with neurexins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), such as glypicans and pikachurin, to mediate synaptogenesis and synaptic differentiation (Agosto2020LRRTM4; karimi2014assessing; Roppongi2020LRRTMs).

In the brain, LRRTM4 is essential for the development of excitatory synapses in regions like the dentate gyrus, where it influences AMPA receptor trafficking and synapse density (Chen2019LRRTM4). It operates through heparan sulfate-dependent interactions, which are critical for its synaptogenic activity (Roppongi2020LRRTMs). In the retina, LRRTM4 is involved in the organization of synaptic complexes between rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells, contributing to the proper localization of synaptic proteins and the regulation of synaptic transmission (Agosto2020LRRTM4; Sinha2020LRRTM4:).

LRRTM4's role extends to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, as it is also implicated in the regulation of GABAergic synapses in the retina, affecting receptor clustering and synaptic function (Sinha2020LRRTM4:). Its activity is crucial for maintaining synaptic integrity and function, influencing cognitive processes and visual signal transmission.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRRTM4 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. A study identified a duplication of the terminal exon of LRRTM4 in a family with a history of Tourette syndrome, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This genetic alteration was found in the female proband and her affected mother, suggesting a potential link between LRRTM4 and these neurodevelopmental conditions (Clarke2021LRRTM4).

LRRTM4 is also associated with cognitive impairments. Genetic polymorphisms in LRRTM4 have been linked to cognitive impairment in a hypotensive aging population, indicating that variations in this gene may contribute to cognitive decline (Chen2019LRRTM4). Additionally, LRRTM4 has been connected to autism spectrum disorders and the risk of attempted suicide in females, based on genome-wide association studies (karimi2014assessing; Ji2021Gene).

In the context of colorectal cancer, the long non-coding RNA lnc-LRRTM4 has been shown to promote cancer progression by enhancing the transcription of the LRRTM4 gene, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Zhang2023LncLRRTM4).

## Interactions
LRRTM4 interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in synapse development and function. It forms complexes with neurexins (Nrx), specifically requiring the heparan sulfate (HS) modification of Nrx for binding. This interaction is essential for presynaptic differentiation and synapse organization, particularly in glutamatergic neurons (Roppongi2020LRRTMs). LRRTM4 also interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and this interaction is mediated by Nrx. The recruitment of Nrx and PTPs by LRRTM4 is crucial for synaptogenesis, as demonstrated by the disruption of these interactions in neurons where Nrx or PTPs are knocked down (Roppongi2020LRRTMs).

In the retina, LRRTM4 is part of a transsynaptic complex between rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells, interacting with pikachurin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). This interaction is HS-dependent and is important for the structural and functional integrity of rod bipolar cell terminals (Agosto2020LRRTM4). These interactions highlight LRRTM4's role in synaptic development and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders.
