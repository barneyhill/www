# SARS1

## Overview
SARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme seryl-tRNA synthetase 1, a crucial component in the protein synthesis machinery of eukaryotic cells. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a process known as aminoacylation. Seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 specifically catalyzes the attachment of serine to its tRNA, playing a vital role in the translation of mRNA into proteins. Beyond its canonical function, SARS1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A expression and telomere integrity, through interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Dulic2024Protein–Protein; Verdura2022Loss). Mutations in the SARS1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis (Verdura2022Loss).

## Structure
Seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 (SARS1) is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in protein synthesis, responsible for attaching serine to its corresponding tRNA. The primary structure of SARS1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. One notable domain is the UNE-S domain, which includes a nuclear localization signal, allowing a portion of the protein to enter the nucleus and regulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Verdura2022Loss).

The secondary structure of SARS1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall 3D conformation. A mutation affecting residues 291-329 in the aminoacylation domain disrupts an important β-strand and displaces the side chain of Phe 321, crucial for recognizing the adenosine ring of the AMP molecule. This structural alteration suggests impaired aminoacylation activity (Verdura2022Loss).

The tertiary structure of SARS1 is characterized by the folding of these secondary elements into a functional 3D shape, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure, if applicable, involves the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details are not provided in the context. SARS1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its function and localization. Splice variant isoforms may also exist, potentially altering the protein's structure and function (Verdura2022Loss).

## Function
SARS1 (seryl-tRNA synthetase 1) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid serine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation. This step is essential for the accurate translation of mRNA into proteins, ensuring the correct incorporation of serine into polypeptide chains during protein synthesis (Verdura2022Loss). SARS1 is also involved in charging selenocysteine tRNA, highlighting its importance in cellular function and protein synthesis (Verdura2022Loss).

In healthy human cells, SARS1 is crucial for maintaining proper protein synthesis and cellular function. It is involved in regulating cell growth, division, and senescence, with mutations in the gene leading to significant cellular and physiological consequences, such as complex spastic paraplegia and cellular senescence (Verdura2022Loss). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated to maintain cell cycle homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and other systemic issues (Verdura2022Loss). SARS1 also has non-canonical roles, potentially influencing processes like tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, immune response, and lifespan (Verdura2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SARS1 gene, which encodes seryl-tRNA synthetase 1, have been linked to several neurological and movement disorders. These include complex spastic paraplegia and ataxia, characterized by symptoms such as microcephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, cardiomyopathy, and deafness. A specific de novo pathogenic variant in SARS1 disrupts a canonical splice site, leading to the inclusion of intronic base pairs and the insertion of amino acids in the protein. This mutation results in a dominant negative effect, rather than haploinsufficiency, and is associated with a phenotype similar to those caused by recessive mutations (Verdura2022Loss).

The loss of function or mutations in SARS1 can also lead to cellular senescence, as evidenced by slower proliferation, structural nuclear abnormalities, and increased β-galactosidase staining in patient-derived fibroblasts. These mutations can impair the aminoacylation activity of SARS1, which is crucial for protein synthesis, and exhibit a dominant-negative effect when co-expressed with wild-type SARS1 (Verdura2022Loss). The precise regulation of SARS1 is essential for maintaining cell growth and cycle homeostasis, and its dysfunction is linked to neurodevelopmental phenotypes and genetic disorders (Verdura2022Loss).

## Interactions
Seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 (SARS1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing roles beyond its canonical function in protein synthesis. In humans, SARS1 interacts with the shelterin protein POT1, which is crucial for telomere integrity. This interaction, confirmed through a GST pull-down assay, involves the C-terminal UNE-S domain of SARS1 binding to the OB1 domain of POT1. This interaction enhances the tethering of POT1 to telomeres, thereby inhibiting telomerase access and suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role for SARS1 by inducing senescence and inhibiting tumor growth (Dulic2024Protein–Protein).

SARS1 also participates in translational readthrough by binding to specific mRNA structures. It interacts with stem-loop motifs in the 3' UTR of mRNAs, which mimic the variable loop of tRNA Ser and tRNA Sec. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of components of the selenocysteine incorporation machinery, such as tRNA Sec and the elongation factor eEFSec, facilitating stop codon suppression (Liu2023SeryltRNA). SARS1's catalytic activity and its unique UNE-S domain are necessary for these interactions, highlighting its role in gene-specific translational regulation (Liu2023SeryltRNA).
