# C11orf58

## Overview
C11orf58, or chromosome 11 open reading frame 58, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise functions in healthy human cells are not fully characterized. The protein encoded by C11orf58 is suggested to be associated with the 26S proteasome, a critical protein complex involved in the degradation of unneeded or damaged proteins, indicating a potential role in proteasome-related pathways (Li2017CLIC). Additionally, C11orf58 has been linked to clinical contexts such as carotid plaque and melanoma, suggesting its involvement in disease mechanisms and potential as a biomarker. Despite these associations, the specific molecular activities and cellular localization of the C11orf58 protein remain to be fully elucidated (Dueker2022Rare; Wu2021Identification).

## Function
C11orf58, also known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 58, is a gene that has been associated with various cellular processes, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully characterized. Research using the CLIC tool has predicted that C11orf58 is associated with the 26S proteasome, a protein complex responsible for degrading unneeded or damaged proteins through proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. This prediction is supported by existing literature, suggesting a role for C11orf58 in the proteasome pathway (Li2017CLIC).

In addition to its potential involvement in the proteasome pathway, C11orf58 has been implicated in studies related to carotid plaque in Dominican Republic families. Gene-based discovery analyses identified rare single nucleotide variants in C11orf58 with suggestive associations with carotid plaque, although specific functions of the gene in healthy cells were not detailed (Dueker2022Rare).

Furthermore, C11orf58 has been included in an m6A-related risk signature for melanoma, indicating its potential role in cancer development and immune response. However, the precise molecular activities and cellular localization of C11orf58 in healthy human cells remain to be elucidated (Wu2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf58 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its specific role in disease mechanisms is still under investigation. In the context of carotid plaque, a subclinical marker of atherosclerosis, C11orf58 showed suggestive associations in a study involving Dominican Republic families. The gene was one of eight that demonstrated evidence for replication in familial samples, indicating a potential link to carotid plaque, although its clinical significance remains unclear (Dueker2022Rare).

In melanoma, C11orf58 was included in a risk signature developed to predict survival outcomes and response to immunotherapy. This signature divided patients into low- and high-risk groups, with the low-risk group showing better prognosis and higher immune checkpoint expression. The study suggests that m6A-related signatures, including C11orf58, could serve as clinical biomarkers in melanoma, although the specific role of C11orf58 within this context was not detailed (Wu2021Identification).

Additionally, C11orf58 has been predicted to be associated with the 26S proteasome, a complex involved in protein degradation, based on co-expression data. This association is supported by existing literature, suggesting a potential role in proteasome-related pathways (Li2017CLIC). However, the direct clinical implications of this association are not fully understood.
