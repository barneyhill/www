# ADGRG2

## Overview
ADGRG2, also known as GPR64, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G2, a member of the adhesion GPCR family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain and a large N-terminal region, which undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage, a process crucial for its signaling functions (Peeters2015The). The ADGRG2 protein is primarily expressed in the epididymis, where it plays a vital role in regulating sperm fluid homeostasis, essential for sperm maturation and transport (Davies2004Targeted; Peeters2015The). Additionally, ADGRG2 is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of transcription factors such as SRE and NFκB, which are important for cell adhesion and migration (Peeters2015The). The receptor's activity is modulated by its structural conformation, particularly through autoproteolytic cleavage, which affects specific signaling pathways (Peeters2015The). ADGRG2's expression in mature intestinal tuft cells suggests a role in sensing microbial metabolites and modulating immune responses, highlighting its involvement in both reproductive and gastrointestinal tissues (Grunddal2021Adhesion).

## Structure
ADGRG2, also known as GPR64, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, characterized by a long N-terminal extracellular region. This region contains a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which undergoes autoproteolysis to produce N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal fragments (CTF) (Joshi2024Mechanisms). The GAIN domain and the seven-transmembrane domain (7TMD) are located on different exons, and some transcripts may encode C-terminal fragment-like receptor proteins (Kuhn2024The).

ADGRG2 has 30 transcript variants with 9 different transcription start sites and 6 different 3' exons, resulting in a complex array of isoforms (Kuhn2024The). The protein's structure includes seven transmembrane helices, typical of GPCRs, and the IP15 peptide agonist adopts an alpha-helical conformation when interacting with ADGRG2, engaging with various transmembrane domains and extracellular loops (Joshi2024Mechanisms).

Key residues involved in peptide binding include Y633, F679, W779, Y787, F850, and F864, with hydrophobic residues deeply inserted into the receptor's core (Joshi2024Mechanisms). The receptor undergoes conformational changes during activation and deactivation, transitioning between 'Bound/Active', 'Partially Dissociated', and 'Unbound/Inactive' states (Joshi2024Mechanisms).

## Function
The ADGRG2 gene, also known as GPR64, encodes an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular and physiological processes. In healthy human cells, ADGRG2 is primarily expressed in the epididymis, where it plays a crucial role in regulating sperm fluid homeostasis, which is essential for sperm maturation and transport (Davies2004Targeted; Peeters2015The). The receptor is part of the adhesion GPCR family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain and a large N-terminal region that can undergo autoproteolytic cleavage, a process important for its signaling functions (Peeters2015The).

ADGRG2 is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of SRE and NFκB transcription factors, which are important for cell adhesion and migration (Peeters2015The). The receptor's activity is modulated by its structural conformation, particularly through autoproteolytic cleavage, which affects SRE but not NFκB pathway activation (Peeters2015The). In the gastrointestinal tract, ADGRG2 is expressed in mature intestinal tuft cells, where it may play a role in sensing microbial metabolites and modulating immune responses (Grunddal2021Adhesion). These functions highlight ADGRG2's involvement in maintaining fluid homeostasis and cellular organization, particularly in reproductive and gastrointestinal tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADGRG2 gene are associated with several male infertility conditions, primarily due to their role in obstructive azoospermia. One significant condition linked to ADGRG2 mutations is X-linked congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which leads to male infertility by preventing normal sperm transport. Truncating mutations in ADGRG2, such as those identified in studies, result in a loss of function of the protein, disrupting fluid reabsorption in the efferent ducts and causing obstructive azoospermia (Wu2020A; Patat2016Truncating). 

In a large Pakistani family, a nonsense mutation in ADGRG2 was identified, which introduced a premature stop codon, truncating the protein and leading to obstructive azoospermia. This mutation was associated with low semen volume and the absence of sperm in the ejaculate, despite normal hormone levels (Khan2018Xlinked). 

ADGRG2 mutations have also been implicated in cases where CFTR mutations, another common cause of CBAVD, are absent, suggesting a genetic heterogeneity in the condition (Yang2017Pathogenic). The gene's role in fluid homeostasis and its potential impact on CFTR activity further highlight its clinical significance in male reproductive health (Patat2016Truncating).

## Interactions
ADGRG2, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. It interacts with the calcium-sensing receptor, which leads to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone and elevation of cAMP levels in parathyroid adenoma cells (Morgan2019The). This interaction is significant in the context of parathyroid adenomas and primary hyperparathyroidism.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ADGRG2 is targeted by miR-326, which binds to its 3'-UTR, leading to down-regulation of ADGRG2 mRNA and protein expression. This interaction has been validated through dual luciferase reporter assays, qPCR, and Western blot techniques (Wu2023Adhesion). The down-regulation of ADGRG2 by miR-326 is associated with inhibited growth and migration of HCC cells, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Wu2023Adhesion).

ADGRG2 also participates in signaling pathways through its constitutive activity, which involves transcription factors such as serum response element (SRE) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB). This activity is thought to occur via coupling to Gα 12/13 and Gα q proteins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Peeters2015The).
