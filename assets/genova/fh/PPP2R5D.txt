# PPP2R5D

## Overview
The PPP2R5D gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'delta, a critical component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. This regulatory subunit is part of a serine/threonine phosphatase complex that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, signaling pathways, and phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades. The protein encoded by PPP2R5D, known as B56δ, is involved in determining substrate specificity and modulating the catalytic activity of the PP2A holoenzyme. It is expressed in various tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain, breast, testis, and gastrointestinal tract. Mutations in the PPP2R5D gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Jordan's syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability and other neurological symptoms (Houge2015B56δrelated; Shang2015De). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its association with clinical disorders underscore its biological and medical significance.

## Structure
The PPP2R5D gene encodes a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme, specifically the B'δ isoform, also known as B56δ. This protein is part of a heterotrimeric complex that includes a catalytic subunit and a scaffolding subunit. The PPP2R5D protein is involved in targeting the holoenzyme to specific substrates and regulating its catalytic activity (Smolen2023Quantitative; Papke2021A).

The tertiary structure of PPP2R5D includes a conserved acidic loop between α-helices 3 and 4, which interacts with catalytic metals in the C-subunit of the PP2A-core dimer. This loop is conserved between PPP2R5C/B56γ and PPP2R5D/B56δ, indicating its importance in holoenzyme function (Smolen2023Quantitative). The protein's structure also features a HEAT repeat domain, contributing to its tertiary structure and facilitating interactions within the holoenzyme complex.

In terms of quaternary structure, PPP2R5D forms part of the PP2A holoenzyme, which is crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. The protein is expressed in most tissues, with higher levels in the brain, breast, testis, and gastrointestinal tissue (Smolen2023Quantitative; Papke2021A). Pathogenic variants, such as E198K and E420K, are located in critical regions affecting the protein's function and are associated with severe clinical symptoms (Smolen2023Quantitative).

## Function
The PPP2R5D gene encodes a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, PPP2R5D is part of a heterotrimeric protein complex that includes a catalytic subunit and a structural/scaffolding protein. The B-subunits, such as PPP2R5D, provide substrate specificity, affect intracellular localization, and regulate the catalytic activity of the holoenzymes (Papke2021A).

PPP2R5D is expressed in most tissues, with higher levels in the brain, breast, testis, and gastrointestinal tissue. It plays a critical role in regulating kinase- and phosphatase-controlled signaling cascades, as evidenced by its involvement in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), which indicates increased ribosomal protein S6-kinase activity (Smolen2023Quantitative). The phosphorylation of PPP2R5D by protein kinase A (PKA) on specific serine residues is crucial for its function, enhancing the overall activity of PP2A by reducing the apparent Km, thereby increasing its catalytic activity (Yu2010Phosphorylation). This regulatory mechanism is particularly enriched in dopaminergic neuronal cells, where it influences PP2A activity through phosphorylation (Yu2010Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP2R5D gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively known as Jordan's syndrome or intellectual developmental disorder autosomal dominant 35 (MRD35). These disorders are characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, hypotonia, seizures, and dysmorphic features (Levine2023Clinical; Shang2015De). Specific mutations, such as E198K, E200K, and P201R, have been identified as contributing to these conditions by disrupting the normal function of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to impaired dephosphorylation of substrates and altered signaling pathways (Houge2015B56δrelated).

The E198K mutation is particularly prevalent and is associated with severe intellectual disability due to its impact on the binding of PP2A subunits (Houge2015B56δrelated). Additionally, mutations in PPP2R5D have been linked to overgrowth syndromes, characterized by increased head circumference and height, as well as intellectual disability (Loveday2015Mutations). The presence of café-au-lait macules (CALMs) has also been reported in some cases, suggesting a potential extension of the phenotypic spectrum associated with PPP2R5D mutations (Robichaud2023A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP2R5D mutations in various developmental and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The PPP2R5D gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. PPP2R5D forms part of the PP2A holoenzyme by interacting with catalytic (PPP2CA/PPP2CB) and scaffold (PPP2R1A/PPP2R1B) subunits, allowing it to participate in the regulation of phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways (Papke2021A). 

One significant interaction of PPP2R5D is with the protein kinase AKT. The wild-type (WT) PPP2R5D forms a complex with AKT and the catalytic subunit PPP2AC, influencing AKT phosphorylation and activity. This interaction is crucial for modulating AKT-mediated signaling pathways, which are involved in cell growth and survival (Papke2021A). The E420K variant of PPP2R5D, however, leads to constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling, resulting in uncoordinated cell growth and altered phosphorylation of various substrates, including GSK3, ß-catenin, and FOXO3 (Papke2021A).

PPP2R5D also interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein, enhancing viral RNA replication. This interaction is specific to both the wild-type and mutant forms of NS5B, suggesting a role for PPP2R5D in the HCV life cycle (Anwar2022PPP2R5D). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PPP2R5D in cellular signaling and viral replication.
