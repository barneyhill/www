# MRPL49

## Overview
The MRPL49 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L49, which is a vital component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, or mitoribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by aiding in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, thereby supporting cellular energy metabolism (Richman2014Mitochondria:). Located at the central protuberance of the mitoribosome, MRPL49 is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the ribosomal complex, facilitating the assembly and insertion of respiratory chain components into the mitochondrial membrane (Richman2014Mitochondria:). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular viability, with mutations in MRPL49 linked to various clinical conditions, including combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (Thomas2024Biallelic).

## Structure


## Function
MRPL49 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitoribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Richman2014Mitochondria:). The mitoribosome, where MRPL49 is active, is specialized for the assembly and insertion of respiratory chain components into the mitochondrial membrane, a process vital for cellular energy metabolism (Richman2014Mitochondria:).

MRPL49 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production, contributing to overall cellular viability and function. It is located at the central protuberance of the mitoribosome, indicating its structural and functional importance in the ribosomal complex (Richman2014Mitochondria:). The protein's activity within the mitochondria underscores its role in supporting the energy demands of the cell, particularly through its involvement in the translation processes that are critical for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Richman2014Mitochondria:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPL49 gene are associated with a range of clinical presentations, including sensorineural hearing loss, leukodystrophy, ovarian insufficiency, intellectual disability, epilepsy, retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts, obesity, hypothyroidism, and psychosis with neurocognitive decline (Thomas2024Biallelic). These conditions are part of a broader category known as combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (COXPD), a rare multisystem disorder (Thomas2024Biallelic). Specific variants such as c.262C>T, p.(Arg88Cys) and c.263G>A, p.(Arg88His) have been identified in different families, showing a pattern of symptoms including developmental delay, ataxia, and renal issues (Thomas2024Biallelic). 

The MRPL49 gene variants lead to a reduction in 16S rRNA levels, impacting the translation of mitochondrially encoded proteins and resulting in decreased activity and levels of components of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes, particularly complexes I and IV (Thomas2024Biallelic). This reduction aligns with a general deficiency in mitoribosome content, contributing to the diverse clinical phenotypes observed in affected individuals (Thomas2024Biallelic). The study suggests that MRPL49 variants are hypomorphic, leading to reduced levels of MRPL49, and identifies these variants as a new cause of COXPD (Thomas2024Biallelic).

## Interactions
MRPL49 is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) and participates in several interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It interacts with the C7orf30 protein, which is associated with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and is involved in translation. This interaction was demonstrated through co-purification and co-sedimentation studies, indicating a specific association with the large ribosomal subunit (Wanschers2012C7orf30).

MRPL49 also interacts with the C-terminal tail of the human mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1L (Oxa1L-CTT). This interaction occurs near the ribosomal exit tunnel in mammalian mitochondria, highlighting MRPL49's role in the protein translation process within mitochondria (Haque2010Properties).

In yeast, MRPL49 has been shown to interact with Mam33, a protein involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome. Mam33 stabilizes unassembled ribosomal proteins, including MRPL49, suggesting a role in ribosome assembly (Hillman2019The).

MRPL49 is also implicated in the proteolytic processing within mitochondria, as its levels are affected by altered dopamine homeostasis, which increases neprilysin activity, leading to MRPL49 cleavage (Lualdi2019Exploring).
