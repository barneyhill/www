# TBXA2R

## Overview
The TBXA2R gene encodes the thromboxane A2 receptor, a critical component of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor plays a pivotal role in mediating the physiological effects of thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and promoter of platelet aggregation. The thromboxane A2 receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including platelet function, vascular tone regulation, and inflammatory responses. It exists in two main isoforms, TPα and TPβ, which arise from alternative splicing and exhibit distinct functional properties. The receptor's activity is modulated through interactions with various G-proteins and other receptors, influencing intracellular signaling pathways that are crucial for cardiovascular homeostasis and immune responses (Wilson2007Heterodimerization; Nakahata2008Thromboxane). Alterations in the TBXA2R gene have been linked to several pathological conditions, including asthma, cancer, and platelet dysfunction, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (kim2005association; Ashton2022The).

## Structure
The TBXA2R gene encodes the thromboxane A2 receptor, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is characterized by seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs, which form part of its secondary structure (Miggin1998Expression; Nüsing1993Characterization). The primary structure of the receptor consists of 343 amino acids, with the first 328 amino acids being identical in both isoforms, TPα and TPβ, which arise from alternative splicing (Miggin1998Expression; Ting2011Thromboxane).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these transmembrane helices into a three-dimensional conformation, allowing interaction with ligands such as thromboxane A2. The receptor's quaternary structure may involve dimerization or oligomerization, which can influence its signaling properties (Wilson2007Heterodimerization; Ting2011Thromboxane).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested by the presence of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the isoforms, which may regulate receptor activity (Hirata1996Two). The TPα isoform contains a 15 amino acid sequence at the C-terminus, while TPβ has a 79 amino acid sequence, indicating structural differences that may affect their function (Hirata1996Two).

## Function
The thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in platelet function and vascular biology. In healthy human cells, TBXA2R is primarily involved in platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, which are crucial for maintaining hemostasis and vascular tone (Nakahata2008Thromboxane). The receptor is activated by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a metabolite of arachidonic acid, leading to the initiation of intracellular signaling pathways that involve G proteins such as Gq and G13. These pathways regulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium signaling, which are essential for platelet shape change and aggregation (Nakahata2008Thromboxane).

TBXA2R is expressed in various tissues, including platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, where it mediates the expression of adhesion proteins and influences cell migration and angiogenesis (Nakahata2008Thromboxane). The receptor's activity is modulated by its isoforms, TPα and TPβ, which can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, affecting their signaling capabilities and cellular responses (Nakahata2008Thromboxane). Through these mechanisms, TBXA2R contributes to the regulation of blood flow, clot formation, and immune responses, playing a vital role in cardiovascular homeostasis (Nakahata2008Thromboxane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TBXA2R gene have been implicated in various diseases. In asthma, specific polymorphisms such as TBXA2R1795T4C and TBXA2R1924T4C are associated with acetyl salicylic acid-intolerant asthma (AIA). The TBXA2R1795T4C polymorphism, particularly in patients with the homozygous CC genotype, is linked to a greater bronchoconstrictive response to aspirin and lower baseline lung function (kim2005association). Another polymorphism, rs34377097, is associated with increased susceptibility to pollen-induced bronchial asthma, especially in children and females, and correlates with impaired lung function (Ganai2023In).

In cancer, the TBXA2R gene is upregulated in multiple tumor types, including bladder, breast, and lung cancers. High expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival, suggesting a role in tumor proliferation and metastasis (Ashton2022The). The rs200445019 polymorphism, resulting in a T399A substitution, has been linked to cancer metastasis across various tissues (Werfel2020Repurposing).

A novel mutation, TBXA2R*c.908T>C (p.L303P), has been associated with platelet dysfunction and congenital thrombocytopenia, leading to mild bleeding symptoms (Bugert2019Platelet).

## Interactions
The thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) participates in several interactions that influence its signaling capabilities. TBXA2R can form heterodimers with its isoforms, TPα and TPβ, which enhances isoprostane signaling. This heterodimerization significantly increases inositol phosphate generation and calcium mobilization in response to isoprostanes, suggesting the creation of a novel isoprostane binding site (Wilson2007Heterodimerization).

TBXA2R also engages in hetero-oligomerization with adenosine A1 receptors. This interaction affects cellular signaling pathways, including cyclic AMP accumulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The hetero-oligomerization modifies receptor functions, leading to a synergistic increase in ERK1/2 activation when both receptors are stimulated, which is not observed with individual receptor activation (Mizuno2012Heterooligomerization).

Additionally, TBXA2R interacts with various G-proteins, including Gq and G12/13, which are involved in activating phospholipase C and influencing actin cytoskeletal remodeling, respectively. These interactions are crucial for platelet activation and other cellular responses (Honma2006Thromboxane; Ting2011Thromboxane).
