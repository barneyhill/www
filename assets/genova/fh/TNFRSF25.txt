# TNFRSF25

## Overview
TNFRSF25, also known as death receptor 3 (DR3), is a gene that encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, specifically a transmembrane receptor protein. This receptor is primarily involved in immune regulation and is expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells. The protein encoded by TNFRSF25 plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses through its interaction with the ligand TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A). The receptor's structure includes an extracellular domain with cysteine-rich domains crucial for ligand binding and an intracellular death domain that mediates apoptotic signaling pathways. TNFRSF25 is implicated in both promoting cell survival and apoptosis, depending on the cellular context, and is involved in maintaining regulatory T cell homeostasis. Its expression and function are significant in various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and inflammatory disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Bittner2017Multifaceted; Valatas2019TL1A; Meylan2011TL1A).

## Structure
TNFRSF25, also known as death receptor 3 (DR3), is a type I membrane protein with a sequence of 417 amino acids and a molecular weight of 45 kDa (Valatas2019TL1A). The protein structure includes an extracellular domain composed of four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are crucial for ligand binding and are characterized by cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds (Liu2014ProgranulinDerived; Borysenko2005Comparative). These CRDs are involved in the interaction with its ligand, TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A), with primary contacts occurring in the second and third CRDs (Liu2014ProgranulinDerived).

The intracellular region of TNFRSF25 contains a death domain, which is involved in apoptotic signaling pathways (Valatas2019TL1A). This domain facilitates interactions with adaptor proteins such as TRADD, leading to the recruitment of TRAF2 and RIP, and the activation of signaling pathways like NF-κB, JNK, p38, ERK, and NFAT (Dostert2019The).

TNFRSF25 is expressed in both transmembrane and soluble forms, and it undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, with 13 variants identified in humans (Valatas2019TL1A; Borysenko2005Comparative). The functional implications of these splice variants are not fully understood.

## Function
TNFRSF25, also known as Death Receptor 3 (DR3), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and plays a crucial role in immune regulation. It is primarily expressed on lymphocytes, including T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells, and is involved in modulating immune responses through its interaction with the ligand TL1A (TNFSF15) (Valatas2019TL1A; Meylan2011TL1A).

In healthy human cells, TNFRSF25 acts as a co-stimulator for T cell activation and expansion, particularly during immune responses. It enhances T cell proliferation by increasing the expression of IL-2 receptors, thereby boosting responsiveness to IL-2, a critical cytokine for T cell growth and function (Valatas2019TL1A; Meylan2011TL1A). TNFRSF25 signaling also promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, and IFNγ, which are important for various immune functions (Meylan2011TL1A).

The receptor is involved in maintaining regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis, where its activation can lead to Treg proliferation, contributing to immune tolerance and homeostasis (Bittner2017Multifaceted). TNFRSF25's role in immune regulation is context-dependent, capable of promoting both cell survival and apoptosis, depending on the signaling environment and cellular context (Bittner2017Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of TNFRSF25, also known as death receptor 3 (DR3), have been implicated in various diseases. In autoimmune diseases, the TL1A-DR3 interaction is crucial for Th17 cell function, with increased DR3 expression promoting Th17 proliferation and contributing to conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Pappu2008TL1A–DR3). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with up-regulation of the TL1A/DR3 system, correlating with disease severity and contributing to chronic inflammation and adaptive immunity dysregulation (Valatas2019TL1A).

In cancer, TNFRSF25 activation through agonistic antibodies and multimeric TL1A proteins has shown potential in inhibiting tumor growth by co-stimulating CD8+ T cells, although its expression is often reduced in cancer tissues, correlating with poorer survival outcomes (Lyu2024Targeting). 

In the context of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (uVTE), the TNFSF15-TNFRSF25 axis is up-regulated, leading to endothelial dysfunction by inducing apoptosis and impairing endothelial colony-forming cell functions, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of uVTE (Della2019Pathologic). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNFRSF25 in various pathological conditions, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for modulating its activity.

## Interactions
TNFRSF25, also known as death receptor 3 (DR3), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and primarily interacts with its ligand, TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A), to mediate immune responses. This interaction is significant in various immune processes, including T cell activation and expansion, particularly in autoimmune disease models (Valatas2019TL1A; Meylan2011TL1A). TL1A binding to TNFRSF25 recruits the intracellular signaling molecule TRADD via its death domain, which then recruits TRAF2 and RIP1 to form complex 1, activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways (Schreiber2010The). 

Atsttrin, a progranulin-derived molecule, also interacts with TNFRSF25 by binding directly to it and inhibiting the activity of TL1A. This interaction involves the first three cysteine-rich domains of TNFRSF25 and is significant in modulating inflammatory responses (Liu2014ProgranulinDerived). 

TNFRSF25 is expressed at low levels on naive T cells and is upregulated upon activation. It is highly expressed by regulatory T cells and a subpopulation of CD11c+ and NK cells (Schreiber2010The). The receptor's interactions with TL1A and other proteins play a crucial role in immune regulation and have potential therapeutic implications in cancer and inflammatory diseases (Valatas2019TL1A; Lyu2024Targeting).
