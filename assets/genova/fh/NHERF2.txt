# NHERF2

## Overview
NHERF2, or Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor 2, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein known as NHERF family PDZ scaffold protein 2. This protein is integral to cellular signaling and structural organization, primarily through its role in forming multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane. Characterized by two tandem PDZ domains and an ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) binding domain, NHERF2 facilitates interactions with various proteins, including receptors and ion transporters, thereby influencing processes such as ion transport, receptor signaling, and cytoskeletal organization (Fam2005P2Y; Oh2004NHERF2). NHERF2 is particularly significant in epithelial and endothelial cells, where it regulates ion transport and cell proliferation, respectively. Its interactions with proteins like the LPA2 receptor and CFTR highlight its role in modulating signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Singh2009Differential; Oh2004NHERF2). Alterations in NHERF2 expression or function can have clinical implications, particularly in conditions such as cystic fibrosis and other gastrointestinal disorders (Singh2009Differential).

## Structure
NHERF2, a member of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor family, is characterized by its two tandem PDZ domains, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions (Oh2004NHERF2). These PDZ domains facilitate the binding of NHERF2 to the carboxyl-termini of target proteins, such as the LPA2 receptor, through specific PDZ-binding motifs (Oh2004NHERF2). The second PDZ domain of NHERF2 is particularly important for its interaction with the LPA2 receptor, which is essential for receptor-mediated phospholipase C-β3 activation (Oh2004NHERF2).

NHERF2 also contains an ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) binding domain, which contributes to its role as a scaffold protein, anchoring membrane proteins and organizing signaling complexes. This structural organization allows NHERF2 to form multiprotein complexes, such as those involving the P2Y1 receptor and PLCβ, which are important for Gαq-mediated signal transduction (Fam2005P2Y).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate NHERF2's activity and interactions, although NHERF2 itself is not a phosphoprotein like NHERF1 (Lau2001Oligomerization). NHERF2 may also have splice variant isoforms that alter its functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
NHERF2 (Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor 2) is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and homeostasis. It is involved in organizing protein complexes at the plasma membrane, influencing ion transport, receptor signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. In endothelial cells, NHERF2 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation by modulating the expression of key cell cycle proteins such as c-Myc, cyclin D1, and p27, thereby maintaining endothelial homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled angiogenesis (Bhattacharya2012NHERF2).

NHERF2 is crucial for the phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins, which are essential for cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. It provides an anchoring surface for ERM and Rho kinase 2, facilitating these processes in endothelial cells (Boratkó2013NHERF2). NHERF2 also interacts with the VE-Cad/β-Catenin complex, playing a role in maintaining intercellular junctions and regulating cell proliferation (Bhattacharya2012NHERF2).

In epithelial cells, NHERF2 is involved in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger-3 (NHE3), impacting ion transport and epithelial cell function (Boratkó2013NHERF2). It is also implicated in the inhibition of CFTR-mediated intestinal anion secretion, highlighting its role in modulating ion transport in epithelial tissues (Singh2009Differential).

## Clinical Significance
NHERF2 (NHERF family PDZ scaffold protein 2) plays a significant role in regulating CFTR-mediated intestinal anion secretion. Alterations in NHERF2 expression or mutations can impact CFTR function, which may have clinical implications in diseases such as cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal disorders. NHERF2 is crucial for the inhibition of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate secretion by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) through the LPA2 receptor. In Nherf2-deficient mice, the inhibitory effect of LPA on CFTR is absent, indicating NHERF2's essential role in this pathway (Singh2009Differential). 

NHERF2 also interacts with the LPA2 receptor to mediate phospholipase C-β3 (PLC-β3) activation, which is important for LPA-induced signaling pathways. This interaction is specific to NHERF2 and does not occur with other LPA receptor isoforms, highlighting its unique role in cellular signaling (Oh2004NHERF2). Disruptions in NHERF2's interactions or expression levels could potentially affect these signaling pathways, contributing to pathological conditions. While the clinical significance of NHERF2 mutations is not fully detailed, its role in CFTR regulation and LPA signaling suggests that alterations could impact diseases where these pathways are critical (Singh2009Differential; Oh2004NHERF2).

## Interactions
NHERF2 (NHERF family PDZ scaffold protein 2) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and structural organization. One of its primary interactions is with the cytoskeletal protein ezrin. NHERF2 binds to ezrin through its ezrin-binding domain (EBD) and an upstream ezrin-binding regulatory sequence (EBRS), which enhances this interaction. Phosphorylation of Serine 303 within the EBRS reduces NHERF2's affinity for ezrin, causing a shift from the apical microvilli to the cytosol (Yang2015The).

NHERF2 also interacts with other proteins such as NHE3 and α-actinin-4, facilitated by non-conserved linkers within its structure (Yang2015The). In pulmonary endothelial cells, NHERF2 is a preferred binding partner for ERM proteins over EBP50, influencing ERM phosphorylation, which is essential for cell adhesion and migration (Boratkó2013NHERF2).

In the central nervous system, NHERF2 interacts with several G protein-coupled receptors, including the P2Y1 receptor, where it modulates calcium signaling by extending the duration of receptor-mediated responses (Fam2005P2Y; Paquet2005Astrocytic). These interactions highlight NHERF2's role in regulating various cellular processes through its scaffold function.
