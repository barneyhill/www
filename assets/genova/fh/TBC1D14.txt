# TBC1D14

## Overview
TBC1D14 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 14, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy and endosomal trafficking. The protein is characterized by the presence of a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as ULK1 and Rab11, although it does not exhibit the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity typical of other RabGAPs (Longatti2012TBC1D14). TBC1D14 functions as a negative regulator of autophagy by modulating the dynamics of recycling endosomes and interacting with the TRAPP complex, particularly affecting the trafficking of ATG9 and the formation of autophagosomes (Lamb2015TBC1D14). The gene's role in cellular homeostasis and its implications in diseases such as melanoma and neurodegenerative disorders underscore its biological significance (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16; Lamb2015TBC1D14).

## Structure
TBC1D14 is a protein characterized by the presence of a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which is crucial for its role in autophagy and endosomal trafficking. The TBC domain is located at the C-terminus of the protein and is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as ULK1 and Rab11, although TBC1D14 does not exhibit GAP activity typical of other RabGAPs (Longatti2012TBC1D14). The protein also contains a specific region, residues 120-223, identified as the TRAPP-binding region (TBR), which is distinct from the region interacting with ULK1 kinase (Lamb2015TBC1D14).

The N-terminal part of TBC1D14 includes a 103 amino acid stretch known as the TBR, which is essential for its interaction with the TRAPPIII complex, affecting the tubulation of recycling endosomes and inhibiting autophagy (Lamb2015TBC1D14). The interaction with Rab11 is mediated through specific residues, and TBC1D14 binds preferentially to activated Rab11bQ70A, suggesting it acts as an effector rather than a GAP (Longatti2012TBC1D14).

The molecular structure of TBC1D14 does not include detailed information on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, nor are there specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms provided in the available context.

## Function
TBC1D14 is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. It functions primarily by interacting with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab11, and is involved in the modulation of recycling endosome (RE) traffic. TBC1D14 binds to Rab11a and Rab11b, influencing the transport of membranes from ULK1- and transferrin-positive REs to forming LC3-positive autophagosomes (Longatti2012TBC1D14). 

TBC1D14 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy by inhibiting autophagosome formation. It does so by sequestering Rab11 or its downstream effectors, thereby disrupting vesicular transport from the recycling endosome (Longatti2012TBC1D14). The protein also interacts with the TRAPP complex, particularly the TRAPPC8 subunit, which is crucial for the activation of RAB1, a process necessary for proper vesicle trafficking and autophagosome formation (Lamb2015TBC1D14). 

In healthy human cells, TBC1D14 is active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates the dynamics of recycling endosomes and contributes to the regulation of autophagy, maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to nutrient deprivation (Lamb2015TBC1D14; Longatti2012TBC1D14).

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D14 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in autophagy and cellular trafficking. Alterations in the expression of TBC1D14 have been associated with melanoma, where its mRNA levels vary according to clinical stage, suggesting a potential role in melanoma progression (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). The gene's involvement in autophagy regulation is crucial, as disruptions in this process are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Lamb2015TBC1D14). 

Mutations in TBC1D14, such as the L5Jcs5 mutation, have been associated with embryonic lethality in mice, indicating a critical role in early development. This mutation results in a serine to glycine change at amino acid 433, which is conserved across species, highlighting its potential importance in cellular processes (Ching2010High). 

The gene's interaction with the TRAPP complex and its regulation of ATG9 trafficking are essential for maintaining autophagy, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to impaired cellular homeostasis (Lamb2015TBC1D14). While the clinical significance of TBC1D14 mutations in specific diseases is not fully elucidated, its role in autophagy suggests it may be relevant to conditions involving cellular degradation and recycling processes.

## Interactions
TBC1D14 is involved in regulating autophagy through its interactions with the TRAPP complex and ATG9 traffic. It is a TBC domain-containing RABGAP that affects membrane trafficking and autophagosome formation. TBC1D14 interacts specifically with the TRAPP complex via the TRAPPC8 subunit, which is crucial for the activation of RAB1, a process necessary for proper autophagosome formation (Lamb2015TBC1D14). The interaction between TBC1D14 and the TRAPP complex is mediated by amino acids 120-223 of TBC1D14, known as the TRAPP-binding region (TBR) (Lamb2015TBC1D14).

Overexpression of TBC1D14 leads to the formation of an enlarged, ULK1-positive tubulated recycling endosome compartment, which inhibits autophagy (Lamb2015TBC1D14). TBC1D14 also interacts with RAB11, facilitating the recruitment of RAB1 to membranes, which is essential for ATG9 trafficking and autophagosome formation (Lamb2015TBC1D14). The study suggests that TBC1D14 acts as a bridge between the TRAPP complex and activated RAB11, modulating the contribution of recycling endosomes and Golgi membranes to autophagosome formation (Lamb2015TBC1D14).
