# EOGT

## Overview
EOGT is a gene that encodes the enzyme EGF domain-specific O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a modification critical for the function of EGF domain-containing proteins. EOGT is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a pivotal role in processes such as Notch signaling, which is essential for cell fate determination and vascular development (Ogawa2019Structure; Ogawa2015Impaired). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and influencing cellular metabolism. Mutations in the EOGT gene have been linked to congenital disorders such as Adams-Oliver syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Nauman2023EOGT; Shaheen2013Mutations).

## Function
The EOGT gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) of epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a post-translational modification crucial for the proper functioning of EGF domain-containing proteins. This enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the modification of proteins such as Notch receptors, which are essential for signal transduction and cell fate determination (Ogawa2019Structure; Ogawa2015Impaired).

EOGT plays a significant role in regulating vascular development and integrity by enhancing Delta-like ligand-mediated Notch signaling, which is vital for intercellular communication (Ogawa2019Structure). In endothelial cells, EOGT is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and proper vascular development, as evidenced by studies showing defects in vascular branching in Eogt mutant mice (Ogawa2019Structure).

The enzyme's activity involves the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins, which is important for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and potentially influencing cellular metabolism through pathways linked to pyrimidine synthesis and UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (Ogawa2019Structure). EOGT's function in healthy cells includes potentiating Notch signaling, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and proper cellular signaling (Ogawa2019Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EOGT gene are associated with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), a rare congenital disorder characterized by aplasia cutis congenita and terminal transverse limb defects. These mutations impair the enzyme's function, leading to reduced O-GlcNAcylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of AOS (Shaheen2013Mutations; Ogawa2015Impaired). Specific mutations such as W207S, R377Q, and G359D fs * 28 have been identified in patients with AOS, affecting the enzyme's stability and activity (Ogawa2015Impaired). The R377Q mutation, for instance, impairs the enzyme's ability to bind UDP-GlcNAc, crucial for its glycosyltransferase activity (Ogawa2015Impaired).

EOGT mutations are also linked to the congenital disorder of glycosylation EOGT-CDG, also known as Adams-Oliver Syndrome Type 4 (AOS4), which includes limb extremity and scalp developmental defects, as well as ocular, vascular, and intellectual abnormalities (Nauman2023EOGT). In addition, altered EOGT expression has been associated with 2% of colorectal adenocarcinoma cases, suggesting a potential role in cancer (Nauman2023EOGT). High EOGT expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates with poor prognosis and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, impacting immune response and tumor progression (Shu2022EOGT).

## Interactions
EOGT, an enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAcylation of EGF-like domains, interacts with several proteins involved in the Notch signaling pathway. It modifies the extracellular EGF repeats of Notch receptors, which are also modified by other glycans such as O-glucose and O-fucose. This modification is crucial for the proper function of Notch and its ligands, Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser), in Drosophila, as well as in mammals (Müller2013The; Sakaidani2012OlinkedNacetylglucosamine; Varshney2017EOGT).

EOGT's activity is essential for maintaining the stability and function of these proteins, as evidenced by phenotypes like wing blisters in Drosophila when EOGT is knocked down. This suggests that EOGT's interaction with EGF-repeat containing proteins is critical for cell adhesion and signaling (Müller2013The; Varshney2017EOGT).

In mammals, EOGT also interacts with proteins involved in extracellular matrix interactions, as indicated by the presence of the CXXGXS/TGXXC motif in several proteins, including NOTCH2, which are substrates for EOGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation (Alfaro2012Tandem). However, there is no evidence of direct interactions between EOGT and nucleic acids (Müller2013The).
