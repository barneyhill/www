# DGLUCY

## Overview
DGLUCY is a gene that encodes the enzyme D-glutamate cyclase, which is involved in amino acid metabolism. The enzyme is categorized as a cyclase, specifically facilitating the conversion of D-glutamate to 5-oxo-D-proline within the cytoplasm. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to metabolic demands. D-glutamate cyclase is particularly significant in the context of mitochondrial function, as its expression is upregulated in response to mitochondrial disorders, suggesting a role in compensatory mechanisms for managing cellular stress (Murgia2018Single). The gene and its encoded enzyme are integral to metabolic pathways that regulate amino acid levels and contribute to overall cellular health.

## Function
DGLUCY (D-glutamate cyclase) is an enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of D-glutamate, an amino acid involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DGLUCY is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the conversion of D-glutamate to 5-oxo-D-proline. This conversion is part of the cellular response to certain metabolic demands and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis (Murgia2018Single).

The enzyme's activity is significant in the context of mitochondrial function, as it has been observed to be upregulated in response to mitochondrial disorders, particularly in COX- muscle fibers. This suggests that DGLUCY may be involved in compensatory mechanisms that help manage cellular stress or dysfunction related to mitochondrial activity (Murgia2018Single). Although the specific function of DGLUCY in healthy cells is not fully detailed, its role in amino acid metabolism indicates its importance in broader metabolic pathways that support cellular and organismal health. The enzyme's activity in converting D-glutamate is crucial for processes that require precise regulation of amino acid levels and metabolic intermediates.
