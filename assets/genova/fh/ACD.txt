# ACD

## Overview
The ACD gene encodes the protein known as TPP1, which is a critical component of the shelterin complex, a group of proteins that protect telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, from degradation and inappropriate repair. TPP1 functions as a telomerase recruitment factor, playing a pivotal role in telomere maintenance by facilitating the addition of telomeric repeats to chromosome ends, thus ensuring chromosomal stability and cellular longevity (Guo2014Inherited; Henslee2021Identification). As a telomere-binding protein, TPP1 interacts with other shelterin components, such as POT1 and TIN2, to regulate telomere length and protect telomeres from being recognized as DNA damage (Grill2021TPP1). Mutations in the ACD gene can lead to telomere biology disorders and have been implicated in various cancers, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Spinella2015A; Revy2022Genetics).

## Function
The ACD gene encodes the telomere-binding protein TPP1, a crucial component of the shelterin complex, which plays a significant role in telomere biology. TPP1 is essential for recruiting telomerase to telomeres, a process vital for maintaining telomere length and ensuring chromosomal stability in human cells (Guo2014Inherited; Henslee2021Identification). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that adds telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends, preventing cellular senescence or apoptosis (Guo2014Inherited). TPP1 interacts with telomerase through a specific region known as the TEL patch, which is necessary for telomerase recruitment (Guo2014Inherited).

In addition to its role in telomerase recruitment, TPP1 enhances the processivity of telomerase, allowing it to synthesize long tracts of telomeric DNA (Guo2014Inherited). TPP1 also interacts with the single-stranded DNA binding protein Pot1, tethering it to telomeres and protecting them from being recognized as DNA damage (Guo2014Inherited). This interaction is crucial for maintaining telomere integrity and preventing genomic instability (Jones2016The). The ACD gene's function in healthy cells is integral to telomere maintenance, which is essential for chromosome stability and cellular lifespan (Guo2014Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACD gene, which encodes the shelterin protein TPP1, are associated with several telomere biology disorders (TBDs). These disorders are characterized by abnormally short telomeres, leading to conditions such as bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and premature hair greying. ACD mutations, such as in-frame deletions like K170 and E169, can result in telomere lengths below the first percentile and are linked to autosomal dominant transmission of TBDs (Guo2014Inherited; Revy2022Genetics). Biallelic variants in ACD have been associated with severe TBDs, including Høyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, which presents with intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, and immunodeficiency (Henslee2021Identification).

ACD mutations have also been implicated in familial cancer syndromes, including cutaneous malignant melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and papillary thyroid cancer. These mutations, which include stopgain, splice-site, and missense variants, may disrupt normal telomere length regulation, potentially leading to abnormally long telomeres (Revy2022Genetics). In leukemia, a somatic mutation in ACD, specifically p.G223V, has been shown to induce telomere lengthening and apoptosis resistance, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Spinella2015A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACD mutations in both telomere-related disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
The ACD gene encodes the TPP1 protein, a crucial component of the shelterin complex involved in telomere maintenance and protection. TPP1 interacts with several key proteins within this complex, including POT1, TIN2, and telomerase. The interaction between TPP1 and POT1 enhances POT1's affinity for single-stranded telomeric DNA, which is essential for preventing the activation of the ATR kinase and ensuring genome stability (Grill2021TPP1). TPP1 also recruits POT1 to telomeres, and its depletion leads to a robust ATR response (Grill2021TPP1).

TPP1 interacts with TIN2 through a more extensive interface than previously understood, involving a newly identified region called the TPP1 TIN2-binding motif extension (TPP1 TBM-ext). This interaction is critical for the TIN2-TRF2 interaction and is essential for hematopoiesis (Grill2021TPP1). TPP1 also binds telomerase through its N-terminal OB domain, facilitating telomerase recruitment to telomeres and enhancing its activity during DNA replication (Grill2021TPP1; Else2007Tpp1Acd).

Mutations in the TPP1-binding region of POT1 and the TEL patch of TPP1, which is crucial for telomerase interaction, are linked to diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, familial melanomas, and inherited bone marrow failure (Guo2014Inherited; Grill2021TPP1).
