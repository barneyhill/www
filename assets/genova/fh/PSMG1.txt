# PSMG1

## Overview
PSMG1 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome assembly chaperone 1, also known as PAC1. This protein is a critical component in the assembly of the 20S proteasome, a core structure within the 26S proteasome complex responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. As a chaperone, PSMG1 facilitates the correct assembly of the proteasome by assisting in the formation of the α-ring and preventing improper dimerization of its subunits (Bedford2010Assembly; Sasaki2010PAC1). The proper function of PSMG1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein turnover, which are vital for normal cellular functions and organismal development. Dysregulation of PSMG1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Sbardella2020Defective; Larsson2022Pancancer).

## Structure


## Function
PSMG1, also known as PAC1, is a proteasome assembly chaperone that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the 26S proteasome complex responsible for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. This process is essential for the degradation of proteins tagged with polyubiquitin chains, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins and damaged proteins (Sasaki2010PAC1). PSMG1 specifically assists in the formation of the α-ring during the assembly of the 20S proteasome, preventing aberrant dimerization of the α-ring subunits (Bedford2010Assembly; Sasaki2010PAC1).

In healthy human cells, PSMG1 is crucial for maintaining proteasome activity, which is necessary for normal cellular functions and organismal development. Its role is particularly significant in tissues with low cell proliferation, such as quiescent adult hepatocytes, where it is responsible for producing the majority of the 20S proteasome. Deficiency in PSMG1 leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and premature cellular senescence, indicating its importance in cellular integrity and homeostasis (Sasaki2010PAC1). The proper assembly and function of the proteasome, facilitated by PSMG1, are essential for preventing proteotoxic stress and ensuring efficient protein turnover (Sasaki2010PAC1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PSMG1 gene, also known as PAC1, have significant clinical implications. In cancer, PSMG1 is frequently overexpressed, which is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This overexpression is often due to genetic alterations such as DNA amplification, contributing to high proteasome activity, a characteristic of cancer cells. PSMG1, along with other proteasome genes, has prognostic potential for overall survival in cancer patients, indicating its importance as a prognostic and therapeutic marker (Larsson2022Pancancer).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, PSMG1 is implicated in Rett Syndrome (RTT). Mutations in the MECP2 gene, which regulates PSMG1, lead to its downregulation, affecting proteasome biogenesis. This results in defective proteasome assembly and function, contributing to the pathophysiology of RTT. The downregulation of PSMG1 in RTT fibroblasts is linked to decreased proteasome activity and impaired protein degradation, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sbardella2020Defective).

In mice, the absence of PSMG1 leads to early embryonic lethality and severe developmental and neurological issues, underscoring its essential role in development and cellular homeostasis (Sasaki2010PAC1).

## Interactions
PSMG1, also known as proteasome assembly chaperone 1, plays a crucial role in the assembly of the 20S proteasome complex. It interacts with other chaperones such as PSMG2 to form the PAC1/PAC2 complex, which is essential for incorporating proteasome alpha-subunits into the full 20S proteasome (de2019Novel). This interaction is vital for the proper folding and assembly of the proteasome, which is necessary for protein degradation.

In the context of proteasome maturation, PSMG1 has been identified as interacting with stable proteasome components and other chaperones, including PSMG2 and PSME4 (Postic2020Probing). These interactions are part of a complex network that facilitates the assembly and function of the proteasome, as indicated by proteome-wide interactome studies (Adolf2024Visualizing).

PSMG1 is also implicated in the maturation of the α-ring, a critical step in 20S proteasome biogenesis. Its transcriptional regulation is influenced by MeCP2, which can lead to dysregulation in conditions such as Rett syndrome (Sbardella2020Defective). The downregulation of PSMG1, along with other chaperones, is linked to defective proteasome biogenesis observed in certain disease states (Sbardella2020Defective).
