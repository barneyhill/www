# GALNT3

## Overview
The GALNT3 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (ppGalNAc-T3), a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of O-GalNAc glycan biosynthesis. This enzyme is integral to the process of O-glycosylation, where it catalyzes the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification crucial for protein stability, signaling, and interactions (Kato2021Polypeptide; Garay2022Polypeptide). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications such as acetylation and methylation, which influence its catalytic and carbohydrate-binding properties (Garay2022Polypeptide). GALNT3 is particularly significant in the glycosylation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a process essential for maintaining mineral metabolism and phosphate homeostasis (Kato2021Polypeptide). Mutations in GALNT3 are linked to disorders such as hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis and hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome, underscoring its clinical importance in phosphate regulation (Yancovitch2011Novel; Ichikawa2010Clinical).

## Structure
The GALNT3 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (ppGalNAc-T3), which is involved in the initiation of O-GalNAc glycan biosynthesis. The enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein, featuring a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a stem region that contribute to its Golgi localization (Garay2022Polypeptide). The catalytic domain is responsible for its glycosyltransferase activity, while the lectin domain, characterized by a β-trefoil fold, assists in high-density O-GalNAc glycosylation and interacts with other glycosyltransferases to modulate enzymatic activity (Garay2022Polypeptide).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in regulating ppGalNAc-T3 activity. Acetylation in the catalytic domain can reduce enzymatic activity, while acetylation in the lectin domain affects carbohydrate recognition. A mutation mimicking acetylation at the K626 site in the lectin domain significantly alters catalytic activity and carbohydrate-binding properties (Garay2022Polypeptide). The enzyme is also subject to methylation, adding another layer of regulation (Garay2022Polypeptide).

Alternative splicing or proteolytic processing may result in soluble forms of ppGalNAc-T3, which lack certain amino acid sequences and contain nuclear localization signals, suggesting potential nuclear functions (Garay2022Polypeptide).

## Function
The human gene GALNT3 encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GalNAc-T3), which plays a crucial role in the process of O-glycosylation. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. This process is essential for the proper functioning of various proteins, influencing their stability, signaling, and interactions (BalcikErcin2018Genomewide; Kato2021Polypeptide).

GalNAc-T3 is particularly important for the O-glycosylation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) on threonine 178, which is critical for its biological activity. This modification is vital for maintaining normal mineral metabolism and phosphate homeostasis (Kato2021Polypeptide). In healthy human cells, GALNT3 is primarily expressed in the pancreas and testis, with lower levels in the kidney, prostate, and intestine (Kato2021Polypeptide).

In addition to its role in mineral metabolism, GalNAc-T3 is involved in the glycosylation of proteins important for sperm maturation and function, such as zonadhesin and equatorin, which are crucial for sperm-egg interaction and fertility (Kato2021Polypeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALNT3 gene are associated with several rare autosomal recessive disorders, primarily hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC) and hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome (HHS). These conditions are characterized by persistent hyperphosphatemia due to increased renal phosphate reabsorption, resulting from decreased levels of active fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a protein crucial for phosphate regulation (Yancovitch2011Novel; Ichikawa2010Clinical).

HFTC is marked by the deposition of calcified tumors in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, leading to painful joint contractures and immobility (Topaz2004Mutations). HHS, on the other hand, involves recurrent painful swellings of the long bones and cortical hyperostosis, often mimicking bone malignancies (Frishberg2004Identification; Olauson2008A). Both conditions are allelic disorders, meaning they are different manifestations of the same genetic defect in GALNT3 (Frishberg2004Identification).

The GALNT3 gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the O-glycosylation of FGF23, which protects it from proteolytic degradation. Mutations in GALNT3 disrupt this process, leading to enhanced degradation of FGF23 and subsequent hyperphosphatemia (Gok2009Newly; Ichikawa2010Clinical). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of GALNT3 in maintaining phosphate homeostasis.

## Interactions
GALNT3, or polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role in O-glycosylation. GALNT3 has strong interactions with proteins such as B3GNT6, ST6GALNAC1, C1GALT1C1, C1GALT1, and GCNT1, as indicated by STRING database analysis (Hussain2013Clinically). It also interacts with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), where it plays a crucial role in preventing FGF23 proteolytic degradation by O-glycosylation at Thr178, a process that is lectin-dependent (Hussain2016Nacetylgalactosaminyltransferases). This interaction is significant for maintaining FGF23 levels, which are important for phosphate regulation and vitamin D metabolism (Garringer2007Two).

Mutations in GALNT3 can alter its interaction with FGF23, impacting the protein's function. For example, in the R162Q mutant, the binding pocket for GalNAc involves a tetrad cavity with different FGF23 residues, indicating altered interaction patterns (Hussain2013Clinically). These interactions highlight GALNT3's role in regulating physiological processes through its glycosylation activity. The context does not provide evidence of GALNT3 interacting with nucleic acids.
