# CREB3L4

## Overview
CREB3L4 is a gene that encodes the protein cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 4, a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is essential for its role in DNA binding and dimerization, facilitating its function as a transcription factor (Pu2020The). CREB3L4 is a type II transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it plays a significant role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Aicha2007Transcriptional). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression in response to cellular stress and hormonal signals, adipogenesis, and chromatin organization during spermiogenesis. It is particularly active in the prostate and testis, with implications in cancer and metabolic disorders (Kim2014Identification; Adham2005Reduction). CREB3L4's interactions with other proteins, such as the androgen receptor, highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like prostate cancer and metabolic conditions (Kim2015Effects; Kim2017The).

## Structure
CREB3L4, also known as Tisp40, AIbZIP, or ATCE1, is a transcription factor that belongs to the CREB/ATF family and is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain. This domain, located in the central region of the protein (amino acids 222-280), is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, a common feature among ATF/CREB proteins (Pu2020The). The bZIP domain facilitates the formation of a stable dimerization interface, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor.

CREB3L4 is a type II transmembrane protein, indicating that it is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It is processed to its active form in response to ER calcium depletion, which is a part of its role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Aicha2007Transcriptional). The protein is primarily cytoplasmic, but deletion of its transmembrane domain results in nuclear localization, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving its translocation to the nucleus (Adham2005Reduction).

CREB3L4 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and function. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its functional properties.

## Function
CREB3L4 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in response to cellular stress and hormonal signals. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nucleus, where it influences various molecular processes. In prostate cells, CREB3L4 is involved in the regulation of genes related to protein processing, RNA metabolism, and stress response. It upregulates genes such as BAG3, DNAJC12, KDELR3, and EDEM1, which are crucial for protein folding, sorting, and degradation, indicating its role in maintaining protein homeostasis (Aicha2007Transcriptional).

CREB3L4 is also implicated in adipogenesis, acting as a negative regulator. It inhibits the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes by promoting the degradation of C/EBPβ, a transcription factor essential for adipocyte differentiation, and by enhancing the expression of GATA3, another negative regulator in this process (Kim2014Identification). This regulation is important for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and suggests potential therapeutic implications for obesity-related conditions.

In addition, CREB3L4 is associated with chromatin organization during spermiogenesis and is highly expressed in the testis, particularly in postmeiotic male germ cells, indicating its role in male germ cell development (Adham2005Reduction).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CREB3L4 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In prostate cancer, CREB3L4 is overexpressed and plays a crucial role in the proliferation of cancer cells by modulating androgen receptor (AR) activity. This interaction enhances AR-mediated transcription, which is essential for prostate cancer cell growth. Knockdown of CREB3L4 results in decreased expression of AR target genes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for prostate cancer (Kim2017The).

In luminal androgen receptor subtype triple-negative breast cancer (LAR TNBC), CREB3L4 is significantly upregulated. Its depletion leads to suppressed cell proliferation and inhibited G1-S transition, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression through the p27-SKP2 pathway. This highlights CREB3L4 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in LAR TNBC, a subtype with poor prognosis and limited treatment options (Ito2024AIbZIPCREB3L4).

In metabolic disorders, CREB3L4 knockout mice exhibit increased adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin sensitivity, particularly when fed a low-fat diet or with aging. These findings suggest that CREB3L4 is involved in lipid metabolism and its absence may contribute to conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes (Kim2015Effects).

## Interactions
CREB3L4 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In prostate cancer cells, CREB3L4 directly interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), enhancing AR-mediated transcription by promoting AR binding to androgen response elements (AREs) within target gene promoters such as PSA. This interaction is crucial for the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and is mediated through the IRE1α pathway, part of the unfolded protein response (Kim2017The).

In breast cancer, CREB3L4 binds directly to the promoter region of the PCNA gene, influencing its transcription. This interaction has been demonstrated through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, indicating that CREB3L4 may play an oncogenic role by modulating PCNA expression (Pu2020The).

CREB3L4 also acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis by interacting with C/EBPβ, a transcription factor. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of C/EBPβ, affecting the expression of adipogenic transcription factors such as PPARγ2 and C/EBPα. CREB3L4's role in adipogenesis is further supported by its ability to increase the expression of GATA3, another negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation (Kim2014Identification).
