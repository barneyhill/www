# OR10J4

## Overview
OR10J4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily J member 4, which is part of the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in olfactory signaling. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that detect odor molecules, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in the perception of smell. The OR10J4 protein is expressed at low levels in various tissues, including the testis, cortex, and thyroid, and has been linked to cardiovascular disease (Guruceaga2017Enhanced). Additionally, OR10J4 has been implicated in interactions with Indian hedgehog (IHH), suggesting a potential role in immune cell function, particularly in thymocyte differentiation (Röth2023Mass). Despite its recognized role in olfactory processes, the detailed interactions and broader physiological implications of OR10J4 remain an area of ongoing research.

## Function
OR10J4 is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are located in the cell membranes of olfactory sensory neurons and play a crucial role in the molecular process of olfaction by binding specific odorants. This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell, which is essential for various organismal outcomes, including food selection, predator avoidance, and social communication (Guruceaga2017Enhanced; Masseroli2015Detection).

OR10J4 has been observed to have low expression in tissues such as the testis, cortex, and thyroid, and is associated with cardiovascular disease (Guruceaga2017Enhanced). The functional analysis of OR10J4 has revealed its involvement in pathways related to G-protein coupled receptors and olfactory receptor activity, highlighting its role in transcription regulation and sensory perception (Guruceaga2017Enhanced). Additionally, OR10J4 has been identified in formaldehyde crosslinking studies, where it was found to interact with Indian hedgehog (IHH), a protein involved in thymocyte differentiation, suggesting a potential role in immune cell function (Röth2023Mass).

## Interactions
The human gene OR10J4, part of the olfactory receptor family, is involved in odor detection and is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). While specific physical interactions of OR10J4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented, some studies provide insights into its potential interactions. 

A study by Röth et al. identified a significant interaction where Indian hedgehog (IHH) was crosslinked to the G-protein coupled receptor OR10J4. This interaction is notable as IHH is expressed in CD4+ CD8+ double-positive cells and plays a role in thymocyte differentiation, as well as being expressed in macrophages (Röth2023Mass). 

In the context of missing protein detection, OR10J4 was identified among olfactory receptors, which are enriched in categories such as G-protein coupled receptors and olfactory receptor activity. However, specific physical interactions of OR10J4 with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed in this study (Guruceaga2017Enhanced). 

Overall, while OR10J4 is recognized for its role in olfactory signaling, detailed interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored in the current literature.
