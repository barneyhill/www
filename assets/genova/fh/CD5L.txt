# CD5L

## Overview
CD5L, also known as CD5 antigen-like, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. The protein product of CD5L is characterized by scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which facilitate its role as a pattern recognition receptor and its interaction with immunoglobulin M (IgM) (Xiao2024CD5L; Wang2023CD5L). Primarily expressed by macrophages, CD5L contributes to the polarization of M2 macrophages, promoting anti-inflammatory responses and tissue repair (Sanjurjo2018CD5L). Additionally, CD5L is implicated in autophagy and lipid homeostasis, influencing processes such as cholesterol efflux and fatty acid metabolism (Bárcena2019CD5L). Clinically, CD5L has been associated with various conditions, including sepsis, cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets (Oliveira2024CD5L; Fatima2017CD5; LaFargue2023Overcoming).

## Structure
CD5L, also known as CD5 antigen-like, is a protein that contains scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are crucial for its function in immune regulation. The protein is encoded by residues 20-347 and includes a signal peptide for secretion (Xiao2024CD5L). CD5L is characterized by multiple SRCR domains, specifically SRCR2 and SRCR3, which are essential for its interaction with the IgM pentamer via the J chain. The SRCR3 domain features a dual-cation-binding site that coordinates two Ca2+ ions, critical for binding to the Fcμ-J complex (Xiao2024CD5L; Wang2023CD5L).

The tertiary structure of CD5L involves the SRCR domains interacting with the J chain of IgM, with the SRCR2 domain forming a disulfide bond with the Cμ3 domain of Fcμ5B, enhancing the stability of the IgM-CD5L complex (Xiao2024CD5L). The quaternary structure of CD5L may involve homodimerization, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications of CD5L may include glycosylation, as suggested by its identification as an up-regulated glycoprotein in atopic dermatitis patients (Kim2008Glycoproteomic). However, specific details on splice variant isoforms are not mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
CD5L, also known as CD5 molecule-like, is a secreted glycoprotein primarily expressed by macrophages and plays a significant role in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, CD5L is involved in promoting an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile and enhancing the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which are key characteristics of M2 macrophage polarization (Sanjurjo2018CD5L). This polarization is crucial for tissue repair and maintaining immune homeostasis. CD5L achieves this by upregulating specific markers such as CD163 and MERTK, while not affecting M1 markers like CD80 (Sanjurjo2018CD5L).

CD5L also plays a role in autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and immune function. It promotes autophagy-mediated upregulation of the transcription factor ID3, which is necessary for the M2 phenotype (Sanjurjo2018CD5L). This autophagic activity is indicated by increased LC3-II content and colocalization with acidic compartments in macrophages treated with CD5L (Sanjurjo2018CD5L).

In the liver, CD5L supports macrophage survival and enhances their phagocytic activity, contributing to the clearance of dead cells and infectious agents. It is also involved in lipid homeostasis, influencing cholesterol efflux and fatty acid metabolism, which helps prevent atherosclerosis (Bárcena2019CD5L).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD5L gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In sepsis, CD5L plays a crucial role in the immune response and survival. CD5L-deficient mice exhibit impaired immune responses, increased susceptibility to infection, and higher mortality rates in sepsis models. The administration of recombinant CD5L has been shown to improve survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for sepsis (Oliveira2024CD5L).

In cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, CD5L overexpression is associated with resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, such as bevacizumab. This resistance is linked to increased CD5L expression in tumor endothelial cells and higher serum levels, which are driven by hypoxia and the upregulation of the transcription factor PPARG. Targeting CD5L with antibodies or RNA-aptamers can restore sensitivity to anti-VEGF therapy, highlighting its role in adaptive resistance mechanisms (LaFargue2023Overcoming).

CD5L is also identified as a potential biomarker for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Elevated levels of CD5L in CML patients suggest its involvement in the disease's pathophysiology, possibly through aberrant STAT signaling pathways. Its expression levels may serve as indicators for monitoring therapeutic responses (Fatima2017CD5).

## Interactions
CD5L, also known as CD5 molecule-like, is a protein that interacts with immunoglobulin M (IgM) through the joining chain (J chain) in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction forms a tripartite complex with Fcμ-J-CD5L, where CD5L binds asymmetrically to the IgM pentamer, occupying a gap with the J chain. The SRCR3 domain of CD5L interacts with several regions of the J chain, including the β5-β6 hairpin, while the SRCR2 domain forms a disulfide bond with Fcμ, specifically between Cys191 in SRCR2 and Cys414 in the Cμ3 domain of Fcμ5B (Xiao2024CD5L; Wang2023CD5L).

CD5L's interaction with IgM does not significantly affect IgM's binding to the IgM-specific receptor FcμR or its role in complement activation. However, it reduces IgM's binding affinity to the mucosal transport receptor pIgR by approximately 500-fold, likely due to structural collisions with the secretory component of pIgR (Xiao2024CD5L; Wang2023CD5L).

CD5L also acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide, which facilitates phagocytosis and reduces inflammation (Oliveira2024CD5L; Martinez2014The).
