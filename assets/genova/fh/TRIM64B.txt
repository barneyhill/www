# TRIM64B

## Overview
TRIM64B is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 64B, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are typically associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The TRIM64B protein is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and is classified as an 'all beta protein' due to its structural composition (Dong2015Structural). The protein's structure includes zinc finger regions, a coiled-coil region, and a B30.2/SPRY domain, which contribute to its complex folding and functional capabilities (Dong2015Structural). TRIM64B has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus, where alterations in its expression and mutations may play significant roles in disease pathophysiology (Tarabichi2020A; Zhang2023Transcriptome).

## Structure
TRIM64B is a protein characterized by specific structural domains that contribute to its function. The I-TASSER model of TRIM64B reveals the presence of two zinc finger regions located between amino acids 15-56 and 87-128, a coiled-coil region spanning amino acids 189-225, and a B30.2/SPRY domain from amino acids 268-449 (Dong2015Structural). These domains are integral to the protein's tertiary structure, suggesting a complex folding pattern that supports its biological roles. The protein is classified as an 'all beta protein' and is predominantly located in the cytoplasm (Dong2015Structural).

TRIM64B is part of the tripartite motif family, which typically includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, contributing to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. While specific post-translational modifications for TRIM64B are not detailed in the provided context, TRIM proteins generally undergo modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which can influence their function and interactions. The context does not provide information on the primary, secondary, or quaternary structures, nor does it mention splice variant isoforms for TRIM64B.

## Clinical Significance
TRIM64B, a member of the tripartite motif family, has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of cancer, TRIM64B is noted for having thesaurus mutations, which are mutations linked to alternative genomic sites with similar sequences. These mutations are the dominant class for TRIM64B and may interact with cancer pathways, offering potential opportunities for translational research (Tarabichi2020A).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), TRIM64B is identified as one of the downregulated genes negatively correlated with the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score. This suggests that lower expression levels of TRIM64B may be associated with increased disease severity, indicating its potential role in the pathophysiology of SLE (Zhang2023Transcriptome).

While TRIM64B was used as a negative control in a study on colorectal cancer, the study did not provide specific information on its clinical significance in this context (Wan2021Genomescale). Overall, the clinical implications of TRIM64B mutations and expression changes are still being explored, particularly in relation to cancer and autoimmune diseases.
