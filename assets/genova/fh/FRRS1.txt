# FRRS1

## Overview
The FRRS1 gene encodes the protein ferric chelate reductase 1, which is involved in the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron, a crucial step in iron metabolism. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, indicating its role in facilitating the transport of iron across cellular membranes. Ferric chelate reductase 1 is essential for maintaining iron homeostasis within the body, impacting various physiological processes, including oxygen transport and DNA synthesis. Dysregulation of FRRS1 expression or function can lead to disorders related to iron metabolism, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as anemia and iron overload disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
