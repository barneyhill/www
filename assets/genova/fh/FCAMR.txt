# FCAMR

## Overview
The FCAMR gene encodes the Fc alpha/mu receptor, a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the immune system by binding to the Fc regions of IgA and IgM antibodies. This receptor is part of the double-disulfide Ig superfamily (ddIgSF), characterized by a unique immunoglobulin superfamily domain structure (Flowers2021Identification). The Fc alpha/mu receptor is primarily expressed on immune cells such as follicular dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and is involved in antigen presentation and immune complex handling (Kikuno2007Unusual). Its expression is regulated by inflammatory cytokines, and it is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune regulation, pathogen defense, and inflammatory responses (WardCaviness2017A). The receptor's involvement in diseases such as coronary atherosclerosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (WardCaviness2017A; Hamvas2018Exome).

## Structure
The FCAMR gene encodes the Fc alpha/mu receptor, which is part of the double-disulfide Ig superfamily (ddIgSF). This family is characterized by a specialized Variable (V)-type immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain that includes a canonical IgSF disulfide bond and an additional disulfide bond, a defining feature of the ddIgSF family (Flowers2021Identification). In humans, the FCAMR protein is a single-domain receptor, which is a result of evolutionary changes where multiple domains present in ancestral forms were lost in early mammals (Flowers2021Identification).

The receptor is involved in immune functions by binding to IgA and IgM antibodies. It is expressed by various immune cells, including follicular dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, as well as in kidney tubules (Flowers2021Identification). The FCAMR protein structure includes immunoglobulin-like domains, which are common in receptors that interact with antibodies. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, influencing receptor function. Splice variants can lead to different isoforms with potentially distinct functional roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The FCAMR gene encodes the Fc alpha/mu receptor (Fca/μR), which plays a significant role in the immune response by binding to the Fc regions of IgA and IgM antibodies. This receptor is primarily expressed on the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the germinal centers of tonsils, where it is involved in antigen presentation and B cell selection during the germinal center response (Kikuno2007Unusual). The Fca/μR is a stable homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that specifically binds polymeric forms of IgM and IgA, but not IgG, indicating a specialized role in immune complex handling (Kikuno2007Unusual).

In healthy human cells, the receptor is involved in the organization and function of immune structures, particularly in secondary lymphoid tissues like the tonsils. It is expressed by a small subpopulation of B cells and CD14+ cells, which may include macrophages or FDCs, suggesting its role in immune regulation and pathogen defense (Kikuno2007Unusual). The receptor's expression pattern and ligand specificity suggest it may influence the development of lymphoid follicles and the early immune response (Kikuno2007Unusual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FCAMR gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In coronary atherosclerosis, genetic variants at the FCAMR-PIGR locus have been associated with the disease through interactions with environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution. These interactions suggest that FCAMR may play a role in the inflammatory processes underlying atherosclerosis (WardCaviness2017A).

In the context of respiratory conditions, FCAMR has been identified as a gene of interest in studies of extreme respiratory outcomes following preterm birth. Variants in FCAMR were found in cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, indicating a potential role in lung development and disease susceptibility (Hamvas2018Exome).

The FCAMR gene has also been linked to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in breast cancer patients treated with paclitaxel. A single nucleotide polymorphism in FCAMR showed a trend toward significant association with CIPN, suggesting that alterations in FCAMR may contribute to the development of this condition (Rodwin2022Biomarkers).

In livestock, FCAMR expression is significantly upregulated in cases of postparturient endometritis in Ossimi sheep, indicating its involvement in immune responses to infections (Safhi2023New).

## Interactions
The FCAMR protein, encoded by the FCAMR gene, is involved in immune responses by binding to the Fc regions of IgA and IgM antibodies. This interaction suggests a role in modulating immune functions through its participation in immune complexes. FCAMR is upregulated by the inflammatory cytokine IL1A, indicating its involvement in inflammatory processes (WardCaviness2017A). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, intestine, heart, and lung, which implies its broad role in immune surveillance and response across different organ systems (WardCaviness2017A).

The study by Ward-Caviness et al. highlights the potential interaction of FCAMR with environmental factors, such as traffic-related air pollution, which may influence its expression and function in the context of coronary atherosclerosis. Although direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, the study suggests that FCAMR, along with PIGR, is implicated in immune responses and inflammatory pathways, potentially through gene-environment interactions (WardCaviness2017A). These interactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases like coronary atherosclerosis, emphasizing the importance of FCAMR in both genetic and environmental contexts.
