# HSD3B1

## Overview
The HSD3B1 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. This enzyme, categorized as a bifunctional oxidoreductase, facilitates the conversion of Δ5-steroid precursors into Δ4-ketosteroids, a pivotal step in the production of various steroid hormones such as progesterone, androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids (Simard2005Molecular; Wang2007Human). The enzyme operates in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and its expression is notably high in the placenta and peripheral tissues, including the skin, mammary gland, and prostate (Simard2005Molecular). The HSD3B1 gene and its encoded enzyme play significant roles in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as prostate cancer, where genetic variants can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Shiota2019Association; Hettel2017HSD3B1).

## Function
The HSD3B1 gene encodes the type I 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-Δ4 isomerase enzyme, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of Δ5-steroid precursors into Δ4-ketosteroids, a key step in the production of all major classes of steroid hormones, including progesterone, androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids (Simard2005Molecular; Wang2007Human). The enzyme is bifunctional, possessing both 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and Δ5-Δ4 isomerase activities within a single protein, and is NAD-dependent, operating in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Simard2005Molecular).

HSD3B1 is predominantly expressed in the placenta and peripheral tissues, including the skin, mammary gland, and prostate (Simard2005Molecular). In the placenta, it plays a significant role in the production of progestins and estrogens during pregnancy, while in peripheral tissues, it facilitates steroid formation from low concentrations of substrates (Simard2005Molecular). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including cytokines like IL-4 and IL-13, which can induce its expression in certain cell types, suggesting a role in immune response regulation (Simard2005Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HSD3B1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in prostate cancer. The HSD3B1 gene encodes the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1, which is crucial for the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from extragonadal precursor steroids. A specific variant of this gene, characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism (1245A>C), results in an amino acid substitution (Asn367Thr) that leads to increased enzyme stability and activity. This variant is associated with resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients, as it facilitates the conversion of adrenal precursor steroids to DHT, promoting cancer progression despite low gonadal androgen levels (Shiota2019Association; Hettel2017HSD3B1).

The presence of the HSD3B1 variant allele is linked to shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. It is also associated with a more rapid progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Thomas2020Germline; Hettel2017HSD3B1). In addition, the variant affects the metabolism of steroidal drugs like abiraterone, potentially altering treatment responses (Shiota2019Association). The HSD3B1 genotype is considered a predictive biomarker for treatment decisions in prostate cancer, influencing the choice between ADT and alternative therapies like abiraterone (Shiota2019Association).
