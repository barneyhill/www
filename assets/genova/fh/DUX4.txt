# DUX4

## Overview
DUX4 is a gene that encodes the double homeobox 4 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its unique double homeobox structure. This protein plays a pivotal role in early embryonic development by activating specific genes and retrotransposons necessary for embryonic genome activation (Hendrickson2017Conserved). The DUX4 protein is distinguished by its two homeodomain regions, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Dong2018Structural). It is primarily expressed in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, although its precise function in these cells remains to be fully elucidated (Gatica2016A). Misexpression of DUX4 is associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness, as well as certain cancers, where it can act as an oncogenic transcriptional activator (Yao2014DUX4-induced; Rehn2020DUX). The regulation of DUX4 expression is critical, as its aberrant activity can lead to significant pathological consequences.

## Structure
The DUX4 protein is characterized by its unique double homeobox structure, which includes two adjacent homeodomain regions, HD1 and HD2, connected by a short linker of 15 residues (Dong2018Structural). Each homeodomain consists of three alpha-helices, with HD1 comprising helices a1-a3 and HD2 comprising helices a4-a6 (Li2018Structural). These homeodomains adopt a classical homeobox fold and are arranged in a head-to-head manner, facilitating DNA binding (Li2018Structural).

The DUX4 protein's tertiary structure includes a highly positive charge, which aids in its interaction with the negatively charged DNA (Li2018Structural). The protein employs a two-step clamp-like DNA binding mechanism, where the RRRR motif of HD1 initially binds to the DNA minor groove, followed by the QNR HD1 motif inserting into the DNA major groove (Dong2018Structural). The quaternary structure involves the DUX4-DH/DNA complex, which belongs to the P3 2 21 space group, with one DUX4-DH protein molecule and one DNA duplex per asymmetric unit (Li2018Structural).

DUX4 also contains multiple nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that contribute to its nuclear import, with NLS1 and NLS2 playing significant roles (Corona2013Multiple). The protein's C-terminal domain is involved in its function as a transcription factor, recruiting additional molecules (Corona2013Multiple).

## Function
DUX4 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in early embryonic development by activating specific genes and retrotransposons during the cleavage stage. It directly binds to the promoters of genes such as ZSCAN4, facilitating the transcriptional program necessary for embryonic genome activation (EGA) (Hendrickson2017Conserved). This activation is essential for de-repressing germ cell heterochromatin and coordinating gene expression for subsequent lineage decisions (Hendrickson2017Conserved).

In healthy human cells, DUX4 is expressed in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, although its specific function in these cells remains unclear (Gatica2016A). DUX4 has strong transcription factor activity, capable of activating a germline transcriptional program and genes involved in early stem cell development (Gatica2016A). It binds to transposable elements, forming alternative promoters for human protein-coding genes, long noncoding RNAs, and antisense transcripts, which may contribute to its role in normal physiology (Gatica2016A).

DUX4 is also involved in the expression of genes associated with stem cell biology and the germline, and it can activate transcription of certain human endogenous retroviruses (Shadle2017DUX4induced). Its activity is tightly regulated, as misexpression is linked to diseases such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (Yao2014DUX4-induced).

## Clinical Significance
The DUX4 gene is clinically significant due to its association with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. FSHD is linked to the aberrant expression of DUX4 from D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on chromosome 4q35. This mis-expression is a result of chromatin relaxation and epigenetic changes, such as hypomethylation and loss of repressive histone modifications, which allow DUX4 expression (Rehn2020DUX; Ganassi2022Antagonism). The expression of DUX4 in muscle cells leads to the activation of genes typically restricted to germline cells, contributing to muscle cell toxicity and degeneration (Yao2014DUX4-induced).

DUX4 is also implicated in certain cancers, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and Ewing-like sarcoma, where rearrangements involving DUX4 produce chimeric proteins with altered transcriptional activity. In B-ALL, the DUX4 rearrangement results in a chimeric protein that acts as an oncogenic transcriptional activator (Rehn2020DUX). The DUX4-IGH fusion protein, for instance, binds to many of the same gene targets as wild-type DUX4 but upregulates fewer genes, indicating altered transcriptional activity (Rehn2020DUX). These alterations in DUX4 expression and function underscore its role in the pathogenesis of both muscular and oncogenic diseases.

## Interactions
DUX4 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in gene regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with PTOV1 and MED25 through its C-terminal activation region, which is involved in recruiting the Mediator complex and RNA polymerase II to promote transcription (Slavin2023The). The interaction with PTOV1 is characterized by high affinity, with the DUX4 activation region wrapping along a groove on the PTOV1 domain (Slavin2023The).

DUX4 also recruits the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP through its C-terminus, leading to increased histone acetylation marks, such as H3K18Ac and H3K27Ac, near DUX4 binding sites. This interaction is crucial for DUX4's function as a transcriptional regulator (Choi2016DUX4).

In the context of immune signaling, DUX4 interacts with STAT1, particularly with its phosphorylated form at Y701, which suppresses the expression of interferon-gamma-stimulated genes by interfering with stable DNA binding and transcriptional activation (Spens2022Human).

DUX4 also interacts with cytoplasmic proteins such as desmin and RNA-binding proteins involved in splicing and mRNA export, highlighting its involvement in muscle differentiation and other cellular processes (Ansseau2016Homologous).
