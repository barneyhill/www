# CFLAR

## Overview
CFLAR, or CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator, is a gene that encodes the c-FLIP protein, a crucial regulator of apoptosis and necroptosis. The c-FLIP protein is categorized as an apoptosis regulator due to its structural similarity to caspase-8, although it lacks proteolytic activity. This protein exists in multiple isoforms, including c-FLIP(L), c-FLIP(S), and c-FLIP(R), each playing distinct roles in modulating cell death pathways. c-FLIP interacts with key components of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), such as procaspase-8 and FADD, to regulate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Additionally, c-FLIP is involved in necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis. The balance of c-FLIP isoforms is critical for cellular homeostasis and immune response regulation, making CFLAR a significant focus in cancer research due to its implications in tumor progression and treatment resistance (Tsuchiya2015FLIP; Faiz2018Cigarette).

## Structure
The CFLAR gene encodes the c-FLIP protein, which is a key regulator of apoptosis. The primary structure of c-FLIP includes two death effector domains (DEDs) and an inactive CASc (CASc*) domain. These structural features are conserved across vertebrates, with the DED motifs facilitating interactions with other proteins in the apoptotic pathway, such as procaspase-8 and FADD (Sakamaki2015Conservation; Smyth2020FLIP(L): page 0 of 6).

The tertiary structure of c-FLIP is characterized by six β-sheets and five α-helices, resembling the structure of human c-FLIP. This structure is crucial for its function in apoptosis regulation (Sakamaki2015Conservation). The CASc* domain contains a pseudocatalytic triad, with conserved arginine and tyrosine residues, which are essential for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Sakamaki2015Conservation).

c-FLIP exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including c-FLIP(L) (long form), c-FLIP(S) (short form), and c-FLIP(R) (Raji). These isoforms differ in their C-terminal regions, with c-FLIP(L) having a pseudo-caspase domain that lacks catalytic activity (Smyth2020FLIP(L): page 0 of 6; Sakamaki2015Conservation page 0 of 8). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, play significant roles in regulating c-FLIP's stability and function (Li2019The).

## Function
The CFLAR gene encodes the cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP), which plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and necroptosis, two forms of programmed cell death. cFLIP is structurally similar to caspase-8 but lacks proteolytic activity due to specific amino acid substitutions. It exists in three isoforms in humans: cFLIP L, cFLIP S, and cFLIP R, each with distinct roles in cell death regulation (Tsuchiya2015FLIP).

cFLIP is involved in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, where it interacts with procaspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). cFLIP L can activate procaspase-8 without interdomain cleavage, altering its substrate specificity, while cFLIP S and cFLIP R inhibit procaspase-8 activation through heterodimerization (Tsuchiya2015FLIP). This regulation determines whether a cell undergoes apoptosis or survives, highlighting cFLIP's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tsuchiya2015FLIP).

In addition to apoptosis, cFLIP is involved in necroptosis, a non-apoptotic cell death pathway. cFLIP S promotes necroptosis by facilitating the assembly of the ripoptosome, while cFLIP L inhibits this process (Faiz2018Cigarette). The balance and concentration of cFLIP isoforms are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating immune responses (Tsuchiya2015FLIP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CFLAR gene, which encodes the c-FLIP protein, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. High levels of CFLAR, particularly the long isoform CFLAR(L), are associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), colorectal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (McLornan2012Prognostic; Humphreys2018FLIP). In AML, elevated CFLAR(L) expression correlates with lower overall survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (McLornan2012Prognostic). 

CFLAR also plays a role in drug resistance. In pancreatic cancer, variations in CFLAR splicing, particularly the SNP rs10190751, affect sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent triptolide. The presence of the rs10190751-A allele, which reduces the expression of the short form CFLAR(S), increases sensitivity to triptolide (Chauhan2015Genomewide). 

In NSCLC, CFLAR interacts with proteins like GMEB1 and USP40, which stabilize CFLAR(L) and inhibit apoptosis, contributing to cancer cell survival. Targeting these interactions could be a therapeutic strategy (An2019Glucocorticoid). Overall, CFLAR's role in apoptosis regulation and its expression levels are crucial in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
CFLAR, also known as c-FLIP, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate apoptosis and necroptosis. It interacts with FADD and procaspase-8 through its death effector domains (DEDs) to form part of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), inhibiting the activation of caspase-8 and preventing apoptosis (Fulda2012Targeting; Irmler1997Inhibition). CFLAR also interacts with the DNA repair protein Ku70, which regulates its stability by inhibiting polyubiquitination. This interaction is acetylation-dependent and can be disrupted by histone deacetylase inhibitors, leading to CFLAR degradation and apoptosis (Kerr2012Identification).

In non-small cell lung cancer cells, CFLAR interacts with GMEB1 and USP40. GMEB1 stabilizes CFLAR by facilitating its interaction with USP40, which de-ubiquitinates CFLAR, reducing its degradation and inhibiting apoptosis (An2019Glucocorticoid). CFLAR also interacts with PRMT5 and PRMT1, which regulate its degradation through methylation processes. PRMT5 decreases CFLAR ubiquitination, while PRMT1 increases it, affecting CFLAR's stability and its role in apoptosis regulation (Li2019The). These interactions highlight CFLAR's role in modulating cell death pathways, making it a potential target in cancer therapy.
