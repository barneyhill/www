# KRTAP20-2

## Overview
KRTAP20-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 20-2, which is part of the keratin-associated protein family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin filament matrix. The keratin-associated protein 20-2 is involved in the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of keratinized tissues. Alterations in the expression and methylation of KRTAP20-2 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may influence cellular pathways related to tumorigenesis and disease progression (Battista2012Bladder; Deng2024Proteomics; Reinert2011Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
KRTAP20-2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and methylation patterns. In bladder cancer, KRTAP20-2 is found to be hypomethylated, which correlates with increased transcript expression. This epigenetic alteration suggests a role in the malignant process by potentially affecting cellular pathways related to tumorigenesis, cell movement, and apoptosis (Reinert2011Comprehensive). The differential methylation of KRTAP20-2 on chromosome 21 is significant in bladder cancer cells compared to non-malignant cells, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Battista2012Bladder).

In the context of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (ACP), KRTAP20-2 is one of the top upregulated proteins in recurrent ACP compared to Rathke's cleft cysts. This upregulation may be associated with the intricate regulation of biological functions in ACPs, suggesting a role in the recurrence of this condition (Deng2024Proteomics).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of KRTAP20-2 in cancer, where its altered expression and methylation status may serve as potential biomarkers for disease detection and progression, particularly in bladder cancer and recurrent ACP.
