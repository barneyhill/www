# AKR1C4

## Overview
AKR1C4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a pivotal role in steroid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of bile acids and the clearance of steroid hormones. As a 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, AKR1C4 catalyzes the reduction of 3-ketosteroids to 3α-hydroxysteroids, facilitating the conversion of bile acid precursors into their active forms necessary for digestion and absorption of dietary fats (Penning2007Human; Rižner2014Role). Additionally, AKR1C4 is involved in the inactivation of potent androgens, such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone, by converting them to less active forms, thus regulating androgen levels in the body (Rižner2014Role). The enzyme's activity is dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, with a preference for NADPH, which supports its function as a reductase in vivo (Rižner2014Role). The gene's expression and function are significant for maintaining steroid hormone balance and overall liver health, with implications in various diseases when altered (Rižner2014Role).

## Structure
The AKR1C4 protein is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and features a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, also known as a TIM barrel. This structure is characterized by an alternating arrangement of α-helices and β-strands forming a β-barrel (Penning2004Structure–function; Rižner2014Role). The enzyme contains a catalytic tetrad consisting of Asp50, Tyr55, Lys84, and His117, with Tyr55 acting as a general acid-base (Rižner2014Role). The cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), binds in a conserved manner across the lip of the β-barrel, while the steroid substrate lies perpendicular to the cofactor (Rižner2014Role).

AKR1C4 is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a significant role in bile acid biosynthesis and steroid hormone clearance (Penning2004Structure–function; Rižner2014Role). The enzyme is cytosolic and facilitates 4-pro-R hydride transfer to the acceptor group (Rižner2014Role). While the context does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of AKR1C4, it is noted that the AKR1C genes, including AKR1C4, are located on chromosome 10p15-p14 and have 12 exons (Rižner2014Role).

## Function
The human gene AKR1C4 encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldo-keto reductase family, specifically involved in steroid metabolism. AKR1C4 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bile acids and the hepatic clearance of steroid hormones (Penning2004Structure–function; Rižner2014Role). The enzyme functions as a 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, catalyzing the reduction of 3-ketosteroids to 3α-hydroxysteroids, which is essential for the conversion of bile acid precursors into their active forms necessary for digestion and absorption of dietary fats (Penning2007Human; Rižner2014Role).

AKR1C4 also participates in the inactivation of potent androgens, such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), by converting them to less active forms like 3α-Diol, thus regulating androgen levels in the body (Rižner2014Role). The enzyme's activity is dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, with a preference for NADPH, which facilitates its role as a reductase in vivo (Rižner2014Role). AKR1C4's function is significant for maintaining steroid hormone balance and preventing the accumulation of toxic compounds, contributing to overall liver health and metabolic homeostasis (Rižner2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AKR1C4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, particularly among postmenopausal women undergoing combined estrogen-progestin therapy, a specific polymorphism, L311V, in AKR1C4 is associated with decreased enzyme activity, potentially increasing mammographic percentage density and breast cancer risk (Alshogran2017Pharmacogenetics). In colorectal cancer (CRC), AKR1C4 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression serves as a sensitive and specific marker for CRC diagnosis (Li2023Comprehensive). 

AKR1C4 is also involved in the 'backdoor pathway' of androgen biosynthesis, which is crucial for male fetal development. Mutations in this gene have been identified in individuals with disordered sexual dysgenesis (DSD), affecting sexual development (Rižner2014Role). Despite these associations, genetic variants in AKR1C4 do not significantly contribute to hypospadias, a condition related to abnormal urethral development (Mares2020Molecular). Additionally, AKR1C4 alterations have been linked to endometrial cancer, where it is up-regulated in more aggressive forms of the disease (Rižner2014Role).
