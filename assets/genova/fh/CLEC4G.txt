# CLEC4G

## Overview
CLEC4G is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 4 member G, a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed in liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells. This protein, also known as LSECtin, is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which facilitates its role as a receptor in the immune system. LSECtin is involved in the recognition and binding of specific carbohydrates on pathogens, contributing to immune defense by aiding in the capture and clearance of viruses and bacteria. The protein's structure, including its transmembrane domain and extracellular CRD, is crucial for its function in pathogen recognition and immune modulation. Additionally, CLEC4G has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including hepatic T-cell activation, tumor immune evasion, and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in both immune homeostasis and disease progression (Valverde2020Molecular; Liu2004Characterization; Huang2009Identification).

## Structure
The CLEC4G gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain (TMD), and an extracellular domain. The extracellular domain includes a neck region and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Huang2009Identification). The neck region is composed of 111 amino acids and contains two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, as well as a heptad repeat pattern that is expected to form alpha-helix coiled-coil structures. This region facilitates the formation of a disulfide-linked dimer through two cysteine residues (Huang2009Identification).

The CRD, spanning the last three exons, is highly conserved among CLEC4G homologues and contains key residues for calcium and carbohydrate binding, including eight conserved cysteines predicted to form disulfide bonds (Huang2009Identification). The CRD's unique set of amino acid residues, such as the EPN motif and Trp265, are critical for binding specific oligosaccharides, including the disaccharide GlcNAcb1-2Man (Huang2009Identification). The protein's structure and glycosylation sites are essential for its function in pathogen recognition, as it can bind to carbohydrate motifs on viral glycoproteins (Huang2009Identification).

## Function
CLEC4G, also known as LSECtin, is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells. It plays a significant role in the immune system by recognizing and binding to specific carbohydrates, such as mannose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and fucose, in a calcium-dependent manner. This binding facilitates the capture and clearance of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, thereby contributing to immune defense mechanisms (Liu2004Characterization; Zhang2013DCSIGN).

LSECtin is involved in cell adhesion and pathogen recognition, which are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. It is co-expressed with DC-SIGNR and shares structural similarities with other C-type lectins, including a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) that is essential for its sugar-binding activity (Liu2004Characterization; Zhang2013DCSIGN). The protein also plays a role in modulating hepatic T-cell activation and facilitating tumor cell immune evasion, which can influence tumor progression (Valverde2020Molecular).

In addition to its immune functions, LSECtin is involved in maintaining and regenerating the intestinal epithelial barrier, highlighting its role in tissue repair and homeostasis (Yang2018Ctype).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLEC4G gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and liver pathologies. In Alzheimer's disease, reduced expression of CLEC4G in neurons is linked to disease progression. The gene is thought to play a protective role by inhibiting the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins, which are implicated in AD pathology. CLEC4G shows an inverse correlation with BACE1, an enzyme involved in Aβ production, suggesting that decreased CLEC4G expression may lead to increased Aβ levels and contribute to AD progression (Feng2024Reduced). Additionally, CLEC4G is involved in microglial activation, and its reduced expression may impair immune cell communication, further influencing AD progression (Feng2024Reduced).

In liver diseases, CLEC4G expression is significantly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This down-regulation is associated with larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, and shorter survival times in HCC patients. CLEC4G is identified as a negative marker for CD34 in liver pathogenesis, and its low expression is linked to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for liver diseases (ACAR2024Investigation; Chen2022Ctype).

## Interactions
CLEC4G, also known as LSECtin, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a role in immune response and pathogen recognition. It interacts with BACE1, a key enzyme in the production of amyloid-beta peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease. This interaction was identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis, and confirmed in Neuro2A cells. CLEC4G suppresses the cleavage of APP by BACE1, reducing amyloid-beta production, which highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (Kizuka2015Clec4g).

CLEC4G also binds to viral glycoproteins, such as those from the Ebola virus, through its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). This interaction is mediated by the binding of CLEC4G to truncated glycans on the viral glycoproteins, specifically GlcNAc-terminated N-linked glycans. This binding is specific and concentration-dependent, suggesting a role in facilitating viral entry (Powlesland2008A).

The protein's CRD is structurally similar to that of other C-type lectins, allowing it to bind to specific glycan structures, such as GlcNAcβ1-2Man, with high affinity. This interaction involves coordination with a conserved calcium ion in the primary binding site (Powlesland2008A).
