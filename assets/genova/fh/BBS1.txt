# BBS1

## Overview
The BBS1 gene encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 protein, a critical component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary membrane protein trafficking. This protein is categorized as part of the WD40 repeat family, characterized by its β-propeller domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins such as the small GTPase ARL6. These interactions are essential for the recruitment of the BBSome to ciliary membranes, a process crucial for the proper functioning of cilia. The BBS1 protein also contains a C-terminal GAE domain, which contributes to the structural stability of the BBSome by interacting with other subunits like BBS9 and BBS8. Mutations in the BBS1 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including retinal dystrophy and obesity, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Singh2019Structure; Beales2003Genetic; Klink2020Structure).

## Structure
The BBS1 protein is a key component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in ciliary membrane protein trafficking. Its structure includes a β-propeller domain, which is part of the seven-bladed WD40 repeat family, characterized by a 'velcro' closure where the N-terminal β1-strand serves as the outermost strand for the last blade (Singh2019Structure). This domain is crucial for interactions with the small GTPase ARL6, which recruits the BBSome to membranes in a GTP-dependent manner (Klink2020Structure). The β-propeller domain of BBS1 also interacts with ARL6:GTP, involving the first and last blades of the domain (Singh2019Structure).

BBS1 contains a C-terminal GAE domain, which interacts with other BBSome subunits such as BBS9 and BBS8, contributing to the structural stability of the complex (Klink2020Structure). The GAE domain is involved in heterodimerization with BBS9, forming a dimerization interface that occludes the peptide-binding site typical of clathrin adaptor GAE domains (Singh2019Structure).

The quaternary structure of BBS1 within the BBSome involves interactions with subunits like BBS4, BBS8, and BBS9, forming a sophisticated intertwined arrangement that is crucial for the complex's function (Klink2020Structure). The BBS1 protein's structure is integral to the assembly and function of the BBSome, with its domains playing key roles in cargo recognition and membrane association (Klink2020Structure).

## Function
The BBS1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the BBSome complex, which plays a significant role in the formation and function of cilia, hair-like structures on the surface of cells. The BBSome is involved in ciliary membrane biogenesis and the trafficking of signaling molecules, essential for various cellular processes such as signal transduction and sensory perception (Zhang2012BBS; Schmid2011U1).

BBS1 predominantly localizes to the basal body or transitional zone of ciliated cells, where it interacts with other BBS proteins, including BBS2, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9, to form the BBSome complex (Schmid2011U1). This complex is crucial for the proper functioning of cilia, as it facilitates the fusion and docking of vesicles to the ciliary membrane, a process necessary for the transport of membrane proteins towards the cilium (Schmid2011U1).

In healthy human cells, BBS1 is also involved in the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway by modulating the ciliary localization of Smoothened (Smo), a key component of this pathway. This regulation is vital for normal tissue patterning during development (Zhang2012BBS). The BBSome, including BBS1, may play a role in the retrograde transport of Smo out of cilia, influencing Shh pathway activation (Zhang2012BBS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS1 gene are associated with a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by symptoms such as retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal anomalies, and cognitive impairment (EstradaCuzcano2012BBS1; Beales2003Genetic). The most common mutation in BBS1 is the M390R variant, which is prevalent in European populations and is often associated with a milder form of BBS (EstradaCuzcano2012BBS1; Beales2003Genetic).

Patients with BBS1 mutations typically exhibit a milder phenotype compared to those with mutations in other BBS genes, with lower penetrance of renal anomalies and polydactyly (Niederlova2019Meta‐analysis). The variability in phenotypic expression can range from nonsyndromic RP, where night blindness is often the first symptom, to classic BBS with multiple systemic features (EstradaCuzcano2012BBS1).

BBS1 mutations can also result in non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, such as triallelic inheritance, where a combination of mutations at different loci is necessary for the disease to manifest (Beales2003Genetic). This complex genetic interaction suggests that BBS1 mutations contribute to BBS through interactions with other genetic loci (Beales2003Genetic).

## Interactions
The BBS1 protein is a crucial component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in membrane-protein trafficking. BBS1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in substrate recognition. It binds to the C-terminal cytosolic tails of proteins such as Smoothened, Patched-1, the Leptin receptor, and polycystin-1. This interaction is facilitated by the plasticity of BBS1, allowing it to reorient and make optimal contacts with multiple cargoes (Singh2019Structure).

BBS1 also interacts with ARL6:GTP, a membrane-associated protein that recruits the BBSome to ciliary membranes. This interaction occurs at the b-propeller domain of BBS1, specifically at blades 1 and 7, and is essential for the entry of the BBSome into cilia (Singh2019Structure).

In addition to these interactions, BBS1 has been shown to interact with proteins such as ALDOB, EEF1A1, and KRT18, as identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation assays. These interactions suggest a role for BBS1 in intracellular trafficking and ciliary function (Oeffner2007Novel).

BBS1's interaction with the IFT complexes, specifically IFT38 of the IFT-B complex, further underscores its role in protein trafficking within the BBSome complex (Singh2019Structure).
