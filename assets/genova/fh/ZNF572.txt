# ZNF572

## Overview
ZNF572 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 572, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 572 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF572 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in gene expression regulation and may have implications in certain diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
