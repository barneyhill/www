# PA2G4

## Overview
The PA2G4 gene encodes the proliferation-associated 2G4 protein, also known as ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1), which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA processing, translation, and transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with multiple cellular components, such as the ErbB3 receptor and the oncoprotein MYCN, playing a significant role in cancer biology. EBP1 is known for its dual isoforms, PA2G4-p42 and PA2G4-p48, which exhibit distinct functional roles, particularly in cancer progression and metastasis. The protein's structure, featuring a 'pita bread' conformation and an RNA-binding domain, facilitates its involvement in ribosome biosynthesis and rRNA processing. Additionally, EBP1's interactions with nuclear Akt and its role in transcriptional repression underscore its importance in cell survival and proliferation (Koach2019Drugging; Stevenson2020A; Yoo2000Interaction).

## Structure
The PA2G4 gene encodes a protein with a complex molecular structure, including two main isoforms, PA2G4-p42 and PA2G4-p48, which have distinct roles in cancer. The protein has a 'pita bread' conformation, consisting of two α-helices enclosing two anti-parallel β-sheets, similar to Type-II Methionine Aminopeptidases, but with only 25% sequence similarity, indicating functional differences (Stevenson2020A). The PA2G4-p48 isoform is characterized by several lysine-rich regions, a LxxLL motif, and phosphorylation sites, which are crucial for its interactions and functions (Stevenson2020A). The N-terminal region is essential for nuclear localization, while the C-terminal region is involved in nucleolar localization and RNA interactions (Stevenson2020A).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in the functional differences between the isoforms. PA2G4-p48 has 42 potential phosphorylation sites, while PA2G4-p42 has 33, affecting their localization and interactions (Stevenson2020A). The protein can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and contains an RNA-binding domain, contributing to its role in ribosome biosynthesis and rRNA processing (Stevenson2020A). The structural features of PA2G4, such as its lysine-rich regions and protein-protein interaction sites, are integral to its function in cellular processes (Stevenson2020A).

## Function
The PA2G4 gene encodes the Ebp1 protein, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including RNA processing, translation, and transcriptional regulation. Ebp1 is involved in ribosome biosynthesis and associates with mature ribosomes, inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation by binding to PKR, which is essential for protein synthesis (Stevenson2020A). It also acts as an endonuclease, cleaving pre-rRNA to generate mature rRNA, highlighting its role in ribosome assembly (Stevenson2020A).

Ebp1 interacts with the ErbB3 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, and this interaction is regulated by the ligand heregulin. Upon stimulation, Ebp1 translocates to the nucleus, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction pathways (Yoo2000Interaction). In the nucleus, Ebp1 functions as a transcriptional repressor, binding to the E2F-1 promoter and inhibiting transcription of E2F1 and androgen receptor-regulated genes (Liu2009Human).

Ebp1 also plays a role in cell survival by interacting with nuclear Akt, preventing DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. This interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation through Protein Kinase C, which is crucial for its anti-apoptotic function (Ahn2006Nuclear). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Liu2006Ebp1).

## Clinical Significance
The PA2G4 gene, also known as ErbB3-binding protein 1 (EBP1), plays a significant role in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PA2G4 is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues, and its elevated levels are associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival. PA2G4 promotes metastasis in HCC by stabilizing FYN mRNA in a YTHDF2-dependent manner, enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increasing metastatic ability (Sun2022PA2G4).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly cases with 3q26 abnormalities, PA2G4 is highly expressed and implicated in maintaining oncogenic signaling. The disruption of the PA2G4-MYC interface using small molecule inhibitors like WS6 has shown potential in reducing AML cell proliferation, suggesting PA2G4 as a druggable target (Marchesini2024Orthogonal).

In neuroblastoma, PA2G4 acts as an oncoprotein, with its overexpression linked to increased cell migration, proliferation, and poor prognosis. The PA2G4-MYCN interaction is crucial in maintaining high levels of MYCN, contributing to tumorigenesis. Targeting this interaction presents a potential therapeutic strategy (Koach2019Drugging).

## Interactions
The PA2G4 protein, also known as ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1), engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are significant in cancer biology. It interacts with the ErbB3 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, through its juxtamembrane domain. This interaction is regulated by the ligand heregulin, which causes PA2G4 to dissociate from ErbB3 and translocate to the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional regulation by interacting with proteins such as Sin3A, Akt, retinoblastoma (Rb), and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) on E2F promoters (Kowalinski2007The; Yoo2000Interaction).

PA2G4 also binds to the oncoprotein MYCN, forming a feedforward loop that maintains high levels of both proteins, contributing to oncogenic signaling. This interaction involves specific amino acids in PA2G4, such as Ser47, Arg271, and Arg272, which are critical for binding (Koach2019Drugging). Additionally, PA2G4 interacts with protein kinase B (Akt), suppressing apoptosis, and with the p53 E3 ligase HDM2, promoting p53 degradation (Stevenson2020A). These interactions highlight PA2G4's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer biology.
