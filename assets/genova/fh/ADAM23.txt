# ADAM23

## Overview
ADAM23 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 23 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, which is characterized by its role in cell adhesion rather than proteolytic activity. The protein is a transmembrane component predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in neural development and function. ADAM23 is involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the regulation of neuronal morphology, primarily through its interactions with integrins and other neural proteins (Goldsmith2004ADAM23; Cal2000ADAM). Its function is essential for the maintenance of neural networks, and alterations in its expression have been linked to various cancers and neurological disorders, including epilepsy (Koskinen2015Identification; Ma2018Low).

## Structure
ADAM23 is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, characterized by a modular domain structure typical of this family. The protein is composed of 832 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 91.9 kDa (Cal2000ADAM). Its structure includes several characteristic domains: a propeptide, a metalloproteinase-like domain, a disintegrin-like domain, cysteine-rich domains, an EGF-like repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Cal2000ADAM). 

The metalloproteinase-like domain of ADAM23 lacks the essential residues for proteolytic activity, indicating its primary function is in cell adhesion rather than protease activity (Cal2000ADAM). The disintegrin-like domain is crucial for its role in cell adhesion, particularly through interaction with the αvβ3 integrin via an RGD-independent mechanism (Cal2000ADAM). 

ADAM23 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is evident in its two forms: a 70 kD mature form and a 100 kD immature form, both of which are glycosylated (Goldsmith2004ADAM23). The 70 kD form is more abundant and likely represents a membrane-bound protein lacking the prodomain (Goldsmith2004ADAM23).

## Function
ADAM23 is a non-catalytic member of the ADAM family, primarily involved in cell adhesion rather than proteolytic activity. It interacts with the αvβ3 integrin through an RGD-independent mechanism, promoting cell adhesion in neural-origin cells (Cal2000ADAM). This interaction is crucial for the development and maintenance of neural networks, as ADAM23 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons and Schwann cells (Souza2021Endocytosis; Goldsmith2004ADAM23).

ADAM23 plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and cell survival. In human neural progenitor cells, upregulation of ADAM23 enhances neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, while its downregulation leads to increased apoptosis and reduced cell survival (MarkusKoch2017ADAM23). The protein is involved in synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth, contributing to the regulation of neuronal morphology and cell adhesion (Souza2021Endocytosis).

ADAM23 is also involved in the trafficking and stabilization of Kv1-potassium channels, which are essential for synaptic function and neuronal signaling (Souza2021Endocytosis). Its presence at the cell surface and its ability to undergo constitutive internalization and recycling contribute to its long half-life and stability, which are important for its function in the central nervous system (Souza2021Endocytosis).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADAM23 gene have been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), ADAM23 expression is significantly reduced in malignant tissues compared to normal and benign tissues. This reduction is associated with advanced FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival outcomes, making ADAM23 an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in EOC patients (Ma2018Low). Similarly, in breast cancer, ADAM23 is frequently silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, which correlates with tumor progression and metastasis. This silencing is linked to lower distant metastases-free and disease-specific survival, serving as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes (Verbisck2009ADAM23).

In neurological disorders, ADAM23 is associated with epilepsy. Studies in mice have shown that a complete knockout of ADAM23 results in severe neurological symptoms, including seizures, indicating its critical role in neuronal function (Koskinen2015Identification). ADAM23 interacts with LGI1, a protein linked to epilepsy, and alterations in ADAM23 expression or mutations could contribute to epilepsy phenotypes by affecting neuronal morphology and function (Owuor2009LGI1associated).

## Interactions
ADAM23 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its disintegrin domain. It promotes cell adhesion by interacting with the αvβ3 integrin via an RGD-independent mechanism. This interaction is mediated by a specific amino acid sequence, AVNECDIT, within the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM23. Mutations in this sequence significantly reduce its adhesion-promoting activity (Cal2000ADAM). ADAM23's interaction with αvβ3 integrin is specific, as it does not promote adhesion in cells expressing other integrins like α5β1 or α2β1 (Cal2000ADAM).

ADAM23 also interacts with the cellular prion protein (PrP C) through its metalloprotease and disintegrin domains. This interaction is glycosylation-independent and suggests that PrP C and αvβ3 integrin may bind the same functional domain of ADAM23 (Costa2009Characterization).

In the context of cancer, ADAM23 negatively modulates αvβ3 integrin activation, which is crucial for cell migration and adhesion during metastasis. Knockdown of ADAM23 enhances αvβ3 integrin activation, suggesting its role in maintaining integrin in a nonactivated state (Verbisck2009ADAM23). ADAM23 also interacts with LGI1, a secreted protein, indicating its involvement in neural signaling pathways (Sagane2008LGI1).
