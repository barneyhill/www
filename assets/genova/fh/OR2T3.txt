# OR2T3

## Overview
The OR2T3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell. OR2T3 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants, contributing to the vast array of olfactory responses (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR2T3 is implicated in various biological processes, including immune response and cell adhesion, and is expressed in non-olfactory tissues such as the skin, where it may influence epidermal homeostasis (Ignatieva2019Exomewide; Uehara2021Non‐invasive; Gregson2015Altered).

## Structure


## Function
OR2T3 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR2T3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory responses (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2T3 has been implicated in other biological processes. It is associated with immune responses, as its expression is elevated during acute rejection in lung transplants, indicating a potential role in inflammatory pathways (Gregson2015Altered). OR2T3 is also involved in the extracellular matrix proteoglycans pathway, suggesting a role in cell adhesion and migration (Ignatieva2019Exomewide).

The expression of OR2T3 is not limited to the olfactory system; it is also found in other tissues, such as the skin, where its downregulation is associated with sensitive skin conditions. This suggests that OR2T3 may play a role in epidermal homeostasis, potentially affecting keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
