# HOXA7

## Overview
HOXA7 is a gene that encodes the homeobox A7 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, a conserved 60-amino acid motif that facilitates DNA binding and is crucial for the protein's function in transcriptional regulation (Rezsohazy2015Cellular). The homeobox A7 protein plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation across various cell types, acting as both a transcriptional activator and repressor depending on the cellular context (Schnabel1996Repression). It is involved in critical developmental processes and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including ovarian cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, where it influences tumor progression and chemoresistance (Afonja2000MEIS1; Bondos2020Contextdependent). The protein's interactions with other transcription factors and cofactors, such as PBX and MEIS1, further modulate its activity and specificity in gene regulation (La2001Human).

## Structure
The HOXA7 protein is a member of the homeobox gene family, characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, a 60-amino acid helix-turn-helix structure that facilitates DNA binding (Rezsohazy2015Cellular). This homeodomain is crucial for the protein's function as a transcriptional repressor, with specific residues in helix III and the N-terminal arm contributing to its repressive activity (Schnabel1996Repression). The protein also contains a hexapeptide motif adjacent to the homeodomain, which mediates interactions with PBC class proteins like Pbx, enhancing its DNA binding specificity (Schnabel1996Repression; Rezsohazy2015Cellular).

The C-terminal region of HOXA7 includes an acidic domain that plays a significant role in its repressor function, particularly in certain cell types (Schnabel1996Repression). The protein's structure is modular, allowing it to function as both a repressor and an activator depending on the cellular context (Schnabel1996Repression).

Post-translational modifications, such as poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, can affect HOXA7's DNA binding ability, although specific details on other modifications like phosphorylation are not extensively documented (Draime2018Posttranslational). Information on splice variant isoforms of HOXA7 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
HOXA7 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in various cell types. In human granulosa cells, HOXA7 enhances cell proliferation by up-regulating the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This up-regulation promotes cell growth through EGFR-mediated signaling pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt, which are crucial for cellular processes like growth and differentiation (Zhang2010Homeobox).

In the context of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), HOXA7 is essential for maintaining stem cell identity and function. It is expressed in fetal liver HSPCs and is necessary for their expansion and reconstitution capabilities. Knockdown of HOXA7 in these cells results in impaired self-renewal, indicating its critical role in sustaining HSPC populations (Dou2016Medial). HOXA7 also interacts with retinoic acid signaling to regulate the expression of genes associated with hematopoietic stem cell fate, suggesting its involvement in the establishment of definitive HSC identity (Dou2016Medial).

HOXA7 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression patterns that are vital for the development and maintenance of specific cell types, contributing to the overall regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
HOXA7 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation. In ovarian cancer, HOXA7 is associated with chemoresistance by inhibiting apoptosis, contributing to tumor survival and metastasis. Its expression can transform ovarian surface epithelial cells, leading to low-grade tumor formation and promoting angiogenesis, which is crucial for tumor growth (Bondos2020Contextdependent). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HOXA7 expression is linked to a poorer response to chemotherapy. It is often co-expressed with MEIS1, and this co-activation is associated with leukemogenesis. The expression of HOXA7 in AML patients correlates with a lower likelihood of achieving a complete response to induction therapy (Afonja2000MEIS1). HOXA7 is also involved in MLL-rearranged leukemias, where it supports the oncogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins, contributing to the transformation of myeloid progenitors (Ayton2003Transformation). In papillary thyroid cancer, HOXA7 serves as a biomarker, and its epigenetic downregulation is linked to recurrence in nonsmall cell lung cancer (Paço2020Methylation). Additionally, HOXA7 plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating cell cycle progression (Brotto2020Contributions).

## Interactions
HOXA7 is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its role in transcriptional regulation. It can form complexes with homeodomain cofactors such as PBX and MEIS1, which modulate its DNA binding specificity and cooperative interactions. These interactions are crucial for altering site recognition and enhancing DNA binding affinity (La2001Human). HOXA7 also competes with AP-1 factors for binding to CBP, a coactivator, which may explain its antagonistic role in TPA-induced differentiation (La2001Human).

In addition to protein interactions, HOXA7 binds to specific DNA sequences, such as the upstream regulatory region of the TGM1 gene, where it acts as a transcriptional repressor. This binding is confirmed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays, indicating a direct interaction with nucleic acids (La2001Human). HOXA7's ability to bind to the HPV-16 E6/E7 enhancer further suggests its role in regulating gene expression by interacting with specific nucleic acid sequences (La2001Human).

These interactions highlight HOXA7's multifaceted role in gene regulation, involving both direct DNA binding and complex formation with other proteins to modulate transcriptional activity.
