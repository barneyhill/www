# DLGAP5

## Overview
DLGAP5, or DLG associated protein 5, is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle organization. The protein product of DLGAP5 is essential for maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. It plays a pivotal role in promoting microtubule polymerization and bipolar spindle formation, which are crucial for accurate cell division. DLGAP5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is regulated throughout the cell cycle, particularly influencing the M phase progression. Its interactions with key cell cycle regulators and involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its significance in cellular proliferation and tumor pathogenesis. The gene's expression and regulation have been implicated in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Rao2022NEAT1MALAT1XISTPKDHsaMir1013pDLGAP5; Chen2024DLGAP5; Tang2021Pancancer).

## Structure
DLGAP5, also known as DLG associated protein 5, is a protein involved in cell cycle regulation. The molecular structure of DLGAP5 is characterized by specific domains that facilitate its interaction with other cellular components. These domains are crucial for its role in the cell cycle, although detailed descriptions of the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function. Phosphorylation is a common modification that can alter the activity, interactions, and stability of proteins, suggesting that DLGAP5's role in cell cycle regulation might be modulated through such modifications.

DLGAP5 also exhibits structural and functional diversity through splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's structure, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its regulatory functions within the cell cycle. The presence of these isoforms indicates a level of complexity in the regulation and function of DLGAP5, allowing it to adapt to different cellular contexts and requirements.

## Function
DLGAP5, also known as DLG associated protein 5, is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle organization. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it is essential for maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Tang2021Pancancer). DLGAP5 is involved in promoting microtubule polymerization and bipolar spindle formation, which are crucial for accurate cell division (Deng2022Whole).

In healthy human cells, DLGAP5 functions as a cell-cycle-regulated protein, particularly influencing the M phase progression by modulating spindle assembly and stabilizing kinetochore fibers. This activity is vital for chromosomal segregation during mitosis, thereby influencing cell proliferation and organismal development (Chen2024DLGAP5). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and genomic integrity.

DLGAP5's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its significance in cell biology, where it contributes to the regulation of cell cycle phases and the prevention of genomic instability. Its activity in the cytoplasm and association with microtubules are key to its function in cell division and proliferation (Tang2021Pancancer).

## Clinical Significance
DLGAP5, also known as DLG associated protein 5, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DLGAP5 is upregulated and associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor treatment outcomes. Its expression is higher in LUAD cases with mutations in driver genes such as ALK, ROS1, NTRK3, and RET, and lower in cases with EGFR or KRAS mutations. DLGAP5 expression correlates with cancer functional states like proliferation and DNA repair, and it affects drug sensitivity, showing increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic drugs and resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant LUAD (Chen2024DLGAP5).

In breast cancer, elevated DLGAP5 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. It is involved in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor development and metastasis. Downregulation of DLGAP5 inhibits these processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2023DLGAP5; Xu2020Elevated).

DLGAP5 is also upregulated in bladder cancer, where it is associated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval. It may be regulated by the NEAT1/MALAT1/XIST/PKD--Hsa-mir-101-3p pathways, indicating its involvement in RNA regulatory networks (Rao2022NEAT1MALAT1XISTPKDHsaMir1013pDLGAP5).

## Interactions
DLGAP5, also known as DLG associated protein 5, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle formation. It is a microtubule-associated protein that interacts with Aurora A kinase, which phosphorylates DLGAP5 and is essential for centrosome maturation and spindle assembly (Kettenbach2011Quantitative). This interaction highlights DLGAP5's role in promoting microtubule polymerization and stability, which is vital for proper cell division (Rao2022NEAT1MALAT1XISTPKDHsaMir1013pDLGAP5).

DLGAP5 is also part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes key cell cycle regulators such as CDK1, CCNB1, and TOP2A, as identified using the STRING database (Rao2022NEAT1MALAT1XISTPKDHsaMir1013pDLGAP5). These interactions suggest that DLGAP5 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression and mitotic regulation. Additionally, DLGAP5 has been shown to interact with NUSAP1, a protein that regulates its expression and influences cell cycle progression and chemotherapy susceptibility in breast cancer cells (Zhang2018Nucleolar).

The interaction network of DLGAP5 also includes proteins involved in microtubule motor activity, further supporting its role in tumor pathogenesis and cell cycle regulation (Tang2021Pancancer).
