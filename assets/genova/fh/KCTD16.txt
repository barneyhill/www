# KCTD16

## Overview
KCTD16 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 16, which is a crucial auxiliary subunit of the GABA B receptor complex. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB domain and a C-terminal domain, which facilitate its oligomerization and interaction with other proteins. KCTD16 plays a significant role in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain by interacting with the GABA B2 subunit, influencing receptor signaling kinetics, and preventing rapid desensitization. Additionally, KCTD16 is involved in modulating synaptic transmission through its interaction with N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, linking GABA B receptor activity with calcium channel function (Zuo2019Structural; Seddik2012Opposite; berner2016gabab).

## Structure
The KCTD16 protein is characterized by its structural complexity, featuring a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain that facilitates oligomerization and protein-protein interactions. This domain is versatile, allowing KCTD16 to form various oligomeric states, including monomeric, tetrameric, and pentameric forms (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted; Balasco2019The). The protein's T1 domain forms an open pentamer, a circular assembly of five subunits, each consisting of a three-stranded β-sheet and five α-helices (Zuo2019Structural). The pentameric structure is maintained even in the absence of the GABA B receptor peptide, indicating its physiological relevance (Zuo2019Structural).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of KCTD16 is predicted to have a propeller-like structure, similar to crystallographic models, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.10 Å against the crystal structure (Esposito2022Alphafold). The BTB domain in the full-length context adopts an open state close to its functional state, with an RMSD of 1.25 Å (Esposito2022Alphafold). KCTD16 interacts with the GABA B2 receptor, with specific interactions involving phenylalanines forming a spiraling ladder and a hydrogen bond between Y903 of GABA B2 and E102 of KCTD16, crucial for binding specificity and affinity (Zuo2019Structural).

## Function
KCTD16 is a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of the GABA B receptor, playing a crucial role in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It interacts specifically with the GABA B2 subunit, forming a complex that influences the receptor's signaling kinetics. Unlike other KCTD proteins such as KCTD12, which promote rapid desensitization, KCTD16 generates primarily nondesensitizing receptor responses, which is essential for maintaining normal inhibitory signaling in neuronal circuits (Zuo2019Structural; Seddik2012Opposite).

KCTD16 contains a C-terminal H2 domain that inhibits desensitization of the GABA B receptor, likely through a steric hindrance mechanism. This domain is crucial for its function, as it prevents the rapid desensitization seen with other KCTD proteins lacking this domain (Seddik2012Opposite; Skoblov2013Protein). Additionally, KCTD16 interacts with N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), specifically CaV2.2, affecting their voltage-dependence and current amplitudes. This interaction suggests a role for KCTD16 in modulating synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter release, linking GABA B receptor activity with calcium channel function (berner2016gabab).

## Interactions
KCTD16 is known to interact with the GABA B receptor complex, specifically binding to the GABA B2 subunit. This interaction is crucial for modulating the receptor's signaling kinetics and is characterized by the formation of a pentameric structure by the KCTD16 T1 domain. The binding involves specific residues that form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, which are conserved among KCTD proteins associated with GABA B receptors (Zuo2019Structural). 

KCTD16 typically forms a pentameric assembly, which is essential for its interaction with the GABA B2 receptor. This interaction does not induce significant conformational changes in KCTD16, indicating the rigidity of its pentameric structure (Zuo2019Structural). The binding of the GABA B2 peptide to KCTD16 occurs with a 1:5 stoichiometry, forming a loop inside the pentameric ring (Zuo2019Structural). 

In addition to its role in the GABA B receptor complex, KCTD16 can form higher-order oligomers, such as hexamers, in the presence of specific peptides. This structural change is facilitated by additional interactions, including hydrogen bonds and cation-π interactions, which enhance the stability of KCTD16 (Sereikaite2019Targeting).
