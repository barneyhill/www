# PRRT1B

## Overview
The PRRT1B gene encodes the proline-rich transmembrane protein 1B, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich regions, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a potential role in cellular signaling pathways. The specific functions and interactions of proline-rich transmembrane protein 1B remain to be fully elucidated, but its structural features imply a significant role in cellular communication and possibly in the modulation of signal transduction processes. Further research is needed to understand the precise biological functions and clinical implications of PRRT1B and its encoded protein.
