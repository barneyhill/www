# DNAJB4

## Overview
DNAJB4 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B4, which is a molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp40 family. This protein is classified as a Type II J-domain protein, characterized by its J-domain that facilitates interaction with Hsp70, enhancing its ATPase activity and assisting in protein folding and quality control (Solana2022The). DNAJB4 plays a critical role in maintaining proteostasis, particularly in striated muscles, where it prevents the accumulation of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates, thereby preserving muscle integrity (Inoue2022Distinctive). The protein's involvement extends to cellular stress responses, where it is upregulated in reaction to proteotoxic stress, such as heat shock, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Miao2019HSP90). Additionally, DNAJB4 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including muscle disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Inoue2022Distinctive; Yu2019Effects).

## Structure
DNAJB4 is a member of the Hsp40 family, specifically classified as a Type II J-domain protein. It features a J-domain, which is crucial for its interaction with Hsp70, promoting ATP hydrolysis and facilitating polypeptide binding (Solana2022The). The J-domain typically consists of approximately 70 amino acids forming four α-helices, with a conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) motif essential for stimulating ATP hydrolysis (Solana2022The). DNAJB4 also contains a glycine-phenylalanine-rich (G/F) linker, which is a characteristic feature of Type II proteins (Solana2022The).

The protein lacks a zinc-finger domain, which distinguishes it from Type I Hsp40 proteins (Solana2022The). DNAJB4's tertiary structure is likely stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, as suggested by its ability to bind the EEVD motif of Hsp70 through hydrophobic contacts (Johnson2021Two). The protein can form quaternary structures through dimerization, a common feature among Hsp40 proteins (Solana2022The).

DNAJB4 is involved in maintaining proteostasis in skeletal muscles, and mutations such as the F90L variant can lead to toxic protein aggregation, affecting muscle function (Inoue2022Distinctive). The protein is predominantly expressed in striated muscles, highlighting its role in muscle integrity (Inoue2022Distinctive).

## Function
DNAJB4, a member of the Hsp40 family, functions as a molecular chaperone, primarily acting as a co-chaperone for HSP70. It enhances HSP70's ATPase activity and facilitates the interaction with substrate proteins, playing a crucial role in protein quality control and homeostasis (Miao2019HSP90). DNAJB4 is predominantly expressed in striated muscles, where it is essential for maintaining muscle integrity by preventing the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins and protein aggregation (Inoue2022Distinctive). This function is vital in skeletal muscles, which are subject to various stresses and require active protein synthesis (Inoue2022Distinctive).

In healthy cells, DNAJB4 assists in the conformational refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins, contributing to cellular proteostasis. It works in conjunction with small heat shock proteins and nucleotide exchange factors to regulate ATPase activity and client protein recognition (Inoue2022Distinctive). DNAJB4 is also involved in the cellular response to proteotoxic stress, such as heat shock or HSP90 inhibitor treatment, which results in elevated translation of both HSP70 and DNAJB4 through m6A-mediated mechanisms (Miao2019HSP90). This regulation is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis under stress conditions, highlighting DNAJB4's role in stress response pathways (Miao2019HSP90).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DNAJB4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A dominant variant, specifically the F90L mutation, in DNAJB4 is linked to a distinctive chaperonopathy characterized by late-onset distal myopathy and the presence of protein aggregates in myofibers. This condition presents with symptoms such as asymmetric hand grip weakness and muscle atrophy, along with unique muscle MRI patterns. The F90L mutation leads to toxic gain-of-function effects through interactions with HSP70, resulting in large cytoplasmic inclusions in myofibers, which are distinct from those seen in DNAJB6 myopathy (Inoue2022Distinctive).

In cancer, DNAJB4 expression levels have been implicated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and stomach adenocarcinoma. In LUAD, DNAJB4 is identified as a hub gene with lower expression levels in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression and prognosis (Yu2019Effects). In stomach adenocarcinoma, DNAJB4 expression is negatively correlated with its methylation status, and low expression is associated with poorer disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Pohl2019Gene). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both muscle-related disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
DNAJB4 interacts with the C-terminal EEVD motif of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), playing a crucial role in modulating its ATPase and client refolding activities. This interaction is selective for the EEVD motif of Hsp70 and does not occur with the similar MEEVD motif of Hsp90. DNAJB4 binds specifically to the carboxylate group and the P5 isoleucine residue within the EEVD motif, with amidation of the carboxylate significantly reducing binding affinity (Johnson2021Two).

DNAJB4 competes with another co-chaperone, CHIP, for binding to the EEVD motif. While both co-chaperones recognize the carboxylate and P5 position, DNAJB4 can accommodate a wider range of amino acids at P5 due to its hydrophobic pocket, unlike CHIP, which prefers small, branched-chain aliphatic residues (Johnson2021Two). This competition influences whether Hsp70-bound proteins are directed towards folding or degradation pathways (Johnson2021Two).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer, DNAJB4 interacts with intracellular proteins, including Src, inhibiting its interaction with activators like FAK, thereby blocking the Src signaling pathway and promoting apoptosis (Fang2023DNAJB4). DNAJB4 also interacts with proteins such as desmin, p62, and filamin C in skeletal muscle, affecting their solubility and aggregation (Inoue2022Distinctive).
