# ME2

## Overview
The ME2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme malic enzyme 2, which is a critical component of cellular metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of L-malate to pyruvate, a reaction that concurrently reduces NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. Malic enzyme 2 plays a significant role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, contributing to energy production and maintaining mitochondrial DNA stability. The enzyme's activity is intricately regulated by allosteric effectors, such as fumarate, which activates it, and ATP, which inhibits it. ME2's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as MRPL45 and DUT, further underscore its importance in mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Clinically, variations in the ME2 gene have been linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, including genetic generalized epilepsy and bipolar disorder, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hsieh2023Suppression; Dae2007Malic; Wang2021Malic).

## Structure
The human malic enzyme 2 (ME2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by converting L-malate to pyruvate. Structurally, ME2 is a homotetramer, meaning it is composed of four identical subunits, each contributing to its quaternary structure (Hsieh2023Suppression; Xu1999Crystal). Each monomer of ME2 consists of four distinct domains: A, B, C, and D. Domain A is involved in tetramerization and catalysis, and it is the site where the allosteric activator fumarate binds (Hsieh2023Suppression; Xu1999Crystal).

The secondary structure of ME2 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with domain B containing a unique parallel five-stranded beta sheet, and domain C featuring a Rossmann fold, which is a common structural motif involved in binding nucleotides like NAD+ (Xu1999Crystal). The enzyme's active site is located in a deep cleft at the interface of domains B and C, requiring divalent cations such as Mg2+ for catalysis (Xu1999Crystal).

ME2 exhibits dual cofactor specificity, utilizing both NAD+ and NADP+, and is subject to complex allosteric regulation, being activated by fumarate and inhibited by ATP (Hsieh2023Suppression). The enzyme's structure allows for significant adaptability at the allosteric site, accommodating various inhibitors that can modulate its activity (Hsieh2023Suppression).

## Function
Malic enzyme 2 (ME2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of L-malate to pyruvate, while simultaneously reducing NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. This reaction is vital for mitochondrial energy metabolism, contributing to the production of NADH and NADPH, which are essential for cellular respiration and energy production (Hsieh2023Suppression). ME2 is involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, where it facilitates the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (Hsieh2023Suppression).

ME2 is regulated by allosteric activators and inhibitors, with fumarate acting as an activator that enhances its activity by increasing substrate affinity, while ATP serves as an inhibitor (Hsieh2023Suppression). The enzyme also plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels and stability by interacting with deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (DUT), which is crucial for dNTP metabolism and mtDNA synthesis (Wang2021Malic).

In addition to its metabolic functions, ME2 is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress by increasing NADPH levels, which helps counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria (Hsieh2023Suppression). This function is particularly important in maintaining cellular redox balance and supporting various metabolic pathways in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The ME2 gene has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders due to its role in neurotransmitter synthesis and neuronal energy metabolism. Genetic variations in ME2 have been associated with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), a condition characterized by various types of seizures. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ME2 gene that are significantly associated with GGE, suggesting that alterations in ME2 expression may influence seizure susceptibility (Wang2019Replication).

ME2 is also linked to psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Research has shown that ME2 expression is significantly reduced in the brains of individuals with bipolar disorder, and specific haplotypes within the ME2 gene are associated with psychosis (Dae2007Malic). The gene's location in the 18q21 region, which has shown linkage disequilibrium with psychosis and mania, further supports its involvement in these conditions (Dae2007Malic).

The shared genetic etiology between bipolar disorder and GGE, with ME2 as a potential common factor, highlights its clinical significance. Anticonvulsants targeting the GABAergic system, which is influenced by ME2 activity, are used to treat both epilepsy and bipolar disorder, underscoring the gene's role in these diseases (Wang2019Replication).

## Interactions
Malic enzyme 2 (ME2) participates in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular metabolism. ME2 interacts with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL45, a relationship influenced by the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate. Fumarate disrupts the ME2-MRPL45 complex, promoting MRPL45's attachment to the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is essential for mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial protein translation (Wang2021Malic). ME2 also interacts with deoxyuridine triphosphatase (DUT), where fumarate-induced ME2 dimerization activates DUT, leading to increased mitochondrial deoxynucleotide triphosphate levels and mtDNA (Wang2021Malic).

ME2 is subject to posttranslational modification by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which methylates ME2 at arginine 67. This methylation inhibits ME2's ability to sense fumarate, suppressing its dimerization and activity. PRMT1's methylation of ME2 also affects its interaction with MRPL45 and DUT, inhibiting DUT activity. This inhibition can be reversed by PRMT1 inhibitors, which enhance DUT activity and increase mtDNA abundance (Wang2021Malic). These interactions highlight ME2's role in linking fumarate signaling to mitochondrial biogenesis and protein synthesis, as well as its regulation by PRMT1 in mitochondrial function and disease progression (Wang2021Malic).
