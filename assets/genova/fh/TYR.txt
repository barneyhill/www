# TYR

## Overview
The TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of melanin, the pigment responsible for coloration in human skin, hair, and eyes. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanin production, including the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA and the subsequent oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone, which are critical for the synthesis of eumelanin and pheomelanin (Sturm2001Human; Lai2016LargeScale). The enzyme's activity is dependent on copper ions, which are essential for its catalytic function (Sturm2009Molecular). Mutations in the TYR gene can lead to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), a condition characterized by reduced or absent melanin production, underscoring the gene's significance in pigmentation (Sturm2001Human). Tyrosinase is regulated by various factors, including transcriptional targets of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and hormonal signals, ensuring its proper function in melanin production (Kondo2011Update).

## Structure
The human tyrosinase (TYR) protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein crucial for melanin biosynthesis. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with 529 amino acids, featuring two copper-binding sites essential for its enzymatic activity (Mahmood2020Insilico; Lai2016LargeScale). The secondary structure of TYR includes a four α-helical bundle that maintains the active site, which contains two copper ions, CuA and CuB, coordinated by specific histidine residues (Katie2018Dynamic). 

The tertiary structure of TYR forms a compact, globular shape, with a unique cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and the absence of a thioether bond near the active site, distinguishing it from other eukaryotic tyrosinases (Lai2016LargeScale). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is common among tyrosinase family proteins (SchmidtKüntzel2005Tyrosinase).

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, are vital for TYR's stability and function. The protein has seven putative N-linked glycosylation sites, with glycosylation at N347 and N371 being crucial for proper folding and stability (Katie2018Dynamic; Lai2016LargeScale). These modifications are essential for TYR's enzymatic activity and its ability to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (Katie2018Dynamic).

## Function
The TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase, which plays a critical role in the melanin biosynthesis pathway. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanin production, specifically the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA and the subsequent oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone. These reactions are essential for the synthesis of both eumelanin and pheomelanin, the two primary types of melanin pigments found in human skin, hair, and eyes (Sturm2001Human; Lai2016LargeScale).

Tyrosinase is a type I transmembrane protein located in melanosomes, specialized organelles within melanocytes responsible for melanin production. The enzyme's activity is dependent on the presence of copper ions, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Sturm2009Molecular). The proper function of tyrosinase is vital for normal pigmentation and provides protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation by contributing to the photoprotective properties of the skin (Kondo2011Update).

Mutations in the TYR gene can lead to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), characterized by reduced or absent melanin production, highlighting the enzyme's importance in pigmentation (Sturm2001Human). Tyrosinase activity is also regulated by various factors, including transcriptional targets of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and hormonal signals, ensuring its proper function in melanin production (Kondo2011Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TYR gene, which encodes the enzyme tyrosinase, are primarily associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). This condition is characterized by a significant reduction or complete absence of melanin production, leading to hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes, as well as visual impairments (Dolinska2017Oculocutaneous; Chaki2011Molecular). OCA1 is subdivided into OCA1A, where there is a complete lack of tyrosinase activity, and OCA1B, which retains some residual enzymatic function (Dolinska2017Oculocutaneous).

Mutations in the TYR gene can lead to the retention of tyrosinase in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in its early degradation and loss of function, a common mechanism in OCA1 (Shah2014Identification). Specific mutations, such as p.Ile198Thr and p.Arg278Ter, have been identified in various populations, contributing to the genetic diversity of OCA1 (Shakil2022Delineating; Shah2014Identification).

Additionally, common TYR variants like p.Ser192Tyr and p.Arg402Gln, when present in certain combinations, can contribute to a partial OCA1 phenotype by significantly reducing tyrosinase activity (Norman2017Identification; Lin2022Evidence). These findings highlight the complexity of genetic interactions in TYR-related albinism and the importance of understanding these mutations for accurate genetic diagnosis and counseling.

## Interactions
Tyrosinase (TYR) is a key enzyme in melanin synthesis and interacts with its homologues TYRP1 and TYRP2 to form a heterotrimeric complex. This complex is crucial for melanin production in melanocytes, as it stabilizes TYR and enhances its enzymatic activity. Computational docking studies have shown that TYRP1 and TYRP2 dock to different adjacent surfaces on TYR, forming a stable and biophysically compatible complex. This interaction positions the C-terminus of each enzymatic domain to allow their transmembrane helices to form a membrane-embedded three-helix bundle (Lavinda2021Biophysical).

The TYR-TYRP1 interaction is characterized by a contiguous channel that facilitates substrate channeling, which is beneficial for melanin synthesis by reducing cellular toxicity and increasing substrate flux. The TYR-TYRP2 interaction involves a larger contact area, indicating a higher affinity interaction. The presence of glycosylation sites in the TYR-TYRP2 interaction suggests evolutionary significance (Lavinda2021Biophysical).

Mutations in TYR, such as H256Y, R402Q, and P406L, can affect these interactions, leading to conditions like oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). These mutations are often located on surfaces that may interact with other proteins, such as OCA2, a putative anion channel (Lavinda2021Biophysical).
