# NPM2

## Overview
NPM2, or nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin 2, is a gene that encodes a nuclear chaperone protein belonging to the nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family. This protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and nucleosome assembly, which are essential processes for gene expression regulation and embryonic development. NPM2 is characterized by its ability to bind histones, particularly histones H2A and H2B, facilitating their storage and assembly into chromatin structures. This function is especially critical during oogenesis and early embryogenesis, where it aids in chromatin decondensation and reorganization in gametes (Frehlick2006New; Okuwaki2012Function). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, enhancing its chromatin remodeling capabilities (Okuwaki2012Function). NPM2 is predominantly expressed in oocytes and is involved in nucleolar organization and chromatin compaction, with its absence leading to fertility defects in mice, although other family members like NPM1 and NPM3 may compensate for some of its functions (Frehlick2006New; Burns2003Roles).

## Structure
The NPM2 protein is a member of the nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family and is characterized by its gene structure, which includes eight exons. It lacks an A1 acid tract in the N-terminal core region, unlike NPM1, but contains the longest A2 acid tract among family members in its C-terminal tail domain (Frehlick2006New). The N-terminal core domain is highly conserved and responsible for oligomerization and chaperone activity, forming a monomer subunit with an eight-stranded beta-barrel topology that assembles into pentameric complexes (Frehlick2006New; Okuwaki2012Function). 

The protein has a classic bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) with the consensus sequence KRN 10 KKK, which is crucial for its nuclear targeting (Frehlick2006New; Inoue2009Role). The C-terminal region also contains a lysine-rich motif important for targeting to nucleolus-like bodies (Inoue2009Role). NPM2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity, particularly in chromatin remodeling (Okuwaki2012Function). The protein's interactions with histones and protamines primarily occur in the C-terminal unstructured regions, with specific interaction sites identified through cross-linking mass spectrometry (Ellard2016Expression).

## Function
NPM2 (nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin 2) is a nuclear chaperone protein involved in chromatin remodeling and nucleosome assembly, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and embryonic development. In healthy human cells, NPM2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes, impacting DNA replication and repair processes (Frehlick2006New; Okuwaki2012Function). 

NPM2 is known for its ability to bind histones, particularly histones H2A and H2B, and mediate their storage and assembly into chromatin structures. This function is crucial during oogenesis and early embryogenesis, where NPM2 helps in the decondensation and reorganization of chromatin in gametes (EirínLópez2006LongTerm; Burns2003Roles). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its chromatin remodeling capabilities (Okuwaki2012Function).

In mammals, NPM2 is expressed predominantly in oocytes and is involved in nucleolar organization and chromatin compaction. Although NPM2-null mice exhibit fertility defects, indicating its importance in early development, other NPM family members like NPM1 and NPM3 may compensate for its absence in certain functions (Frehlick2006New; Burns2003Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NPM2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including melanoma and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). In melanoma, NPM2 is hypermethylated and downregulated, which correlates with its absence in malignant melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes. This loss of expression suggests that NPM2 could serve as a diagnostic marker to distinguish malignant melanoma from benign melanocytic lesions (Fujiwara2019Gene). The study by Fujiwara et al. highlights the potential of NPM2 as an immunohistochemical marker for melanoma, indicating its clinical significance in differentiating between malignant and benign conditions (Fujiwara2019Gene).

In the context of MPM, the loss of NPM2 expression is observed in a significant majority of cases, with 76% of patients showing negative expression. This loss is associated with poor prognosis and is negatively correlated with clinicopathological factors such as the completeness of cytoreduction score and vascular tumor emboli. Although NPM2 expression levels are related to certain pathological features, they do not independently predict patient outcomes in MPM (Wu2022Loss). The findings suggest that NPM2 could be a potential therapeutic target for MPM, given its role in tumor pathology (Wu2022NPM2).

## Interactions
NPM2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and nucleosome assembly. It forms stable pentameric complexes and interacts with chromosomal proteins such as histones and protamines. NPM2 preferentially interacts with the distal part of the nucleoplasmin pentamer, particularly with histones H2A, H2B, and H4, while no interactions are detected for H3 (Ellard2016Expression). These interactions are modulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can fine-tune histone sequestration and deposition (Ellard2016Expression).

NPM2 also interacts with protamines, with saturation occurring at a specific stoichiometric ratio, similar to its interactions with histones (Ellard2016Expression). Cross-linking mass spectrometry has revealed that these interactions occur primarily in the C-terminal unstructured regions and the lateral face of the nucleoplasmin pentamer (Ellard2016Expression).

In the context of sperm chromatin remodeling, NPM2 is involved in chromatin decondensation and nucleosome assembly, although its activity is lower compared to NPM1. This reduced activity may be due to the absence of an 'A1 tract' in human NPM2, which is crucial for chromatin decondensation in other species (Okuwaki2012Function). NPM2's interactions with nucleic acids are also significant, as it can bind to DNA and mediate nucleosome assembly at low concentrations (Okuwaki2012Function).
