# KRTAP6-3

## Overview
KRTAP6-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 6-3, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. This family of proteins is integral to the structural composition of human hair, particularly in the hair cortex, where they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to enhance hair strength and flexibility. The keratin-associated protein 6-3 is characterized by its high content of glycine and tyrosine, as well as significant amounts of cysteine and serine, which contribute to its ability to form strong cross-links with keratin. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the mechanical properties and overall appearance of hair (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP6-3 encodes a keratin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of human hair. This protein is part of the KAP6 family, which is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, along with significant amounts of cysteine and serine. The proteins in this family, including KRTAP6-3, are small, ranging from 7.3 to 11.1 kDa, and feature repetitive units of glycine-tyrosine and glycine-tyrosine-glycine residues. These structural characteristics suggest that KRTAP6-3 contributes to the formation of a robust and flexible hair fiber by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP6-3 is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it is involved in the cross-linking of keratin filaments, which is essential for maintaining hair strength and resilience. The high glycine-tyrosine content of KRTAP6-3 allows it to form strong interactions with keratin, influencing hair texture and quality. This protein's role in the hair cortex is vital for the structural integrity of hair, contributing to its mechanical properties and overall appearance (Rogers2006Human).
