# TMBIM1

## Overview
TMBIM1, or transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif protein family. This protein is integral to cellular processes, particularly in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is predominantly located in membranous compartments such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. The TMBIM1 protein is involved in extrinsic apoptosis pathways, where it interacts with the death receptor Fas/CD95/Apo1 to modulate apoptosis. Additionally, TMBIM1 plays a significant role in calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation, acting as an inhibitor of adipogenesis. Its multifaceted functions have implications for various health conditions, including metabolic disorders and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Gao2022TMBIM1; RojasRivera2014TMBIM; Zhao2021TMBIM1).

## Function
TMBIM1, a member of the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif protein family, plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is primarily located in membranous compartments such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. In healthy human cells, TMBIM1 is involved in regulating extrinsic apoptosis pathways by forming a complex with the death receptor Fas/CD95/Apo1, which reduces Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. This interaction likely occurs at the Golgi apparatus, where TMBIM1 decreases the distribution of Fas to the plasma membrane without altering its overall expression levels (RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

TMBIM1 also plays a role in calcium homeostasis and signaling pathways that influence cell survival. It is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation, acting as an inhibitor of adipogenesis. This function is achieved by promoting the degradation of NEDD4, an E3 ligase that stabilizes PPARg, a key regulator of adipogenesis. By destabilizing PPARg, TMBIM1 inhibits the formation of fat cells, which has implications for metabolic health (Zhao2021TMBIM1). These activities highlight TMBIM1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
TMBIM1 is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TMBIM1 is overexpressed compared to normal brain tissues. This overexpression is associated with higher malignancy and worse prognosis. TMBIM1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and autophagy, processes crucial for tumor metastasis and progression, by stimulating the autophagic degradation of E-cadherin via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 axis. Knockdown of TMBIM1 reduces migration and invasion of GBM cells, suggesting its role as an oncogene and potential prognostic marker in gliomas (Gao2022TMBIM1).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), the genetic variant rs992157, located in the intron of TMBIM1, is associated with increased CRC risk. This variant acts as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for TMBIM1, with higher expression levels linked to increased metastasis risk. TMBIM1's role in CRC progression and metastasis is further supported by its involvement in regulating apoptosis and inflammation (Orlando2016Variation; Zhang2019Genetic).

TMBIM1 also plays a protective role against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by modulating inflammatory responses and metabolic processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2017Tmbim1).

## Interactions
TMBIM1 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the E3 ligase NEDD4, which plays a role in stabilizing the nuclear transcription factor PPARg by preventing its proteasomal degradation. TMBIM1 promotes the autoubiquitination and degradation of NEDD4, thereby indirectly destabilizing PPARg and inhibiting adipogenesis (Zhao2021TMBIM1). This interaction involves both the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of TMBIM1, and the WW domains of NEDD4 mediate this interaction (Zhao2021TMBIM1).

TMBIM1 also forms a complex with the death receptor Fas/CD95/Apo1, potentially at the Golgi apparatus, which reduces Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis by decreasing the distribution of Fas to the plasma membrane (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). This interaction is specific to FasL-induced pathways and does not affect apoptosis triggered by TNFα or intrinsic death stimuli (RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

These interactions highlight TMBIM1's role in regulating apoptosis and adipogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders and diseases involving cell death.
