# STIP1

## Overview
The STIP1 gene encodes the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, a co-chaperone protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate interactions with molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, thereby aiding in protein folding and stabilization. STIP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell growth and survival by regulating the folding and function of other proteins. It is also involved in the regulation of the Hsp90 ATPase activity, maintaining it in an open conformation to receive client proteins, which is vital for the proper functioning of the chaperome network (Bhattacharya2020The; Lackie2022Stressinducible). Beyond its intracellular roles, STIP1 can be secreted to provide neuroprotective signals, highlighting its significance in cellular stress response and signal transduction (Lackie2022Stressinducible). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Chao2013Tumor; Lackie2022Stressinducible).

## Structure
The STIP1 protein, also known as Hop or Sti1, is a hydrophilic protein primarily composed of α-helical domains. It contains three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, named TPR1, TPR2A, and TPR2B, each consisting of tandem arrays of two antiparallel α-helices with 34 amino acid repeats (Bhattacharya2021The; Scheufler2000Structure). These TPR domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with the C-terminal EEVD motifs of Hsp70 and Hsp90, forming helix-turn-helix motifs (Scheufler2000Structure). The protein also includes two aspartate-proline-rich (DP) segments, DP1 and DP2, which have α-helical folds with six helices in DP1 and five in DP2 (Bhattacharya2021The).

STIP1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions with other proteins (Bhattacharya2021The). The full-length structure of STIP1 has not been resolved, but its modular arrangement of TPR and DP domains suggests a complex tertiary structure. There is debate about whether STIP1 functions as a monomer or dimer, with some studies suggesting that a Hsp90 dimer binds only one STIP1 molecule (Bhattacharya2021The). The protein's ability to form complexes with heat shock proteins indicates a quaternary structure (Bhattacharya2021The).

## Function
STIP1, also known as stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, functions as a co-chaperone that interacts with the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, facilitating the transfer of substrate proteins between these chaperones. This interaction is crucial for protein folding, stabilization, and assembly in eukaryotic cells (Bhattacharya2020The). STIP1 forms a ternary complex with Hsp70 and Hsp90, using its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains to bind specific sequences on these chaperones, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of the 26S/30S proteasome, a key component in protein degradation (Bhattacharya2020The).

In healthy human cells, STIP1 plays a role in maintaining proteostasis by shifting the balance from protein folding towards degradation. This balance is crucial for cellular fitness and resilience to proteotoxic stress (Bhattacharya2020The). STIP1 is also involved in the regulation of Hsp90 ATPase activity, maintaining it in an open conformation to receive client proteins, which is vital for the proper functioning of the chaperome network (Lackie2022Stressinducible).

STIP1 is active primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell growth and survival by regulating the folding and function of other proteins (Bhattacharya2020The). Its role in cellular stress response and signal transduction is also significant, as it can be secreted to provide neuroprotective signals via the prion protein (Lackie2022Stressinducible).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STIP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, STIP1 is involved in the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, a key feature in conditions such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). STIP1 interacts with α-synuclein, facilitating its phosphorylation at serine residue 129 (S129), which is a pathological marker in these diseases. Elevated levels of STIP1 in PD and DLB brains are associated with increased α-synuclein toxicity and aggregation, suggesting that STIP1 may exacerbate disease pathology (Lackie2022Stressinducible).

In cancer, STIP1 is overexpressed in several types, including ovarian cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). High STIP1 expression is linked to poor prognosis and reduced survival rates in these cancers. In ovarian cancer, STIP1 expression correlates with high-grade tumors and reduced overall survival (Chao2013Tumor). In OSCC, STIP1 overexpression is associated with poor cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival (Dourado2023Stress). In CRC, STIP1 promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the STAT3 signaling pathway, and its knockdown suppresses these processes (Xia2021STIP1).

## Interactions
STIP1, also known as stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, is a co-chaperone that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis. It acts as a scaffold protein facilitating interactions between lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β). The TPR1 and TPR2B domains of STIP1 bind with the AOL domain of LSD1, while the TPR2A and TPR2B domains interact with the kinase domain of GSK3β. This interaction is essential for GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of LSD1, enhancing LSD1 stability and promoting cell proliferation (Tsai2018Stressinduced).

STIP1 also interacts with the protein tyrosine kinase JAK2, where it is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues 134 and 152. This phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, influencing STIP1's stability, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, and secretion (Chao2022JAK2Mediated).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, STIP1 interacts with Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) and heat shock proteins, including HSP90, to regulate c-Myc expression. This interaction influences telomerase activity and cell proliferation (Wang2020GOLPH3).
