# MTX3

## Overview
MTX3, or metaxin 3, is a gene that encodes the metaxin 3 protein, which is integral to mitochondrial function. The protein is categorized as a mitochondrial import protein and shares homology with glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), featuring conserved domains such as GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37. These domains are crucial for its role in the import and assembly of proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane, a process essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Adolph2019Metaxin). Metaxin 3 is part of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein import machinery and interacts with other proteins within the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and cellular energy production (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated; Oakley2023Hidden). The evolutionary conservation of MTX3 across vertebrates highlights its fundamental role in cellular processes related to mitochondria (Adolph2019Metaxin).

## Structure
The MTX3 (metaxin 3) protein is characterized by its highly conserved nature across vertebrates, including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles (Adolph2019Metaxin). The primary structure of human MTX3 consists of 326 amino acids (Adolph2019Metaxin). The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, with little presence of beta strands (Adolph2019Metaxin). 

MTX3 contains specific domains, including GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37. In humans, the GST_N_Metaxin1_like domain spans residues 5 through 77, the GST_C_Metaxin1_3 domain covers residues 105-241, and the Tom37 domain extends from residues 23 to 142 (Adolph2019Metaxin). These domains are conserved across different species, indicating a shared evolutionary origin (Adolph2019Metaxin).

The tertiary structure of MTX3 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but the presence of these conserved domains suggests a stable and functional 3D conformation. There is no specific information on the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications of MTX3 in the context provided. The protein's conservation and domain structure suggest its involvement in mitochondrial import processes, similar to other metaxin proteins (Adolph2019Metaxin).

## Function
Metaxin 3 (MTX3) is a protein involved in mitochondrial function, specifically in the import and assembly of proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is homologous to mitochondrial import proteins and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), characterized by the presence of GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37 domains (Adolph2019Metaxin). These domains are conserved across various vertebrate species, indicating a fundamental role in cellular processes related to mitochondria (Adolph2019Metaxin).

MTX3 is part of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein import machinery, similar to other metaxin proteins such as MTX1 and MTX2, which are involved in the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). Although the specific function of MTX3 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested to play a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, impacting cellular energy production and apoptosis regulation (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated; Adolph2019Metaxin). The evolutionary conservation of MTX3 across vertebrates underscores its importance in mitochondrial processes (Adolph2019Metaxin).

## Interactions
MTX3 (metaxin 3) is a component of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, where it interacts closely with other proteins such as SAM50 and MTX2. MTX3 is predicted to form heterodimers with MTX2, which acts as a key interaction domain within the metaxin family. This interaction is supported by high MC scores in structural predictions, indicating a specific interaction preference between MTX3 and MTX2 (Oakley2023Hidden). 

Complexome profiling studies have shown that MTX3 co-migrates with MTX2 and SAMM50, suggesting that these proteins form a subassembly within the MIB complex. This subassembly is distinct from another subassembly involving MTX1 and DNAJC11, highlighting the specific network of interactions that MTX3 participates in within the MIB complex (Huynen2016Evolution).

MTX3 is also mentioned in the context of the MICOS complex, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial inner membrane structure. Metaxins, including MTX3, are part of the SAM complex that aids in outer membrane b-barrel protein biogenesis and cristae architecture maintenance, indicating a role in mitochondrial trafficking and protein import (Mukherjee2021MICOS).
