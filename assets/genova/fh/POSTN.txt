# POSTN

## Overview
The POSTN gene encodes periostin, a secreted extracellular matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in tissue development and repair. Periostin is categorized as a matricellular protein, which is involved in the structural organization and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including an N-terminal signal sequence, a cysteine-rich EMI domain, and four fasciclin I-like (FAS1) domains, which facilitate interactions with integrins and other ECM proteins (Hoersch2010Periostin; Field2015Novel). These interactions are crucial for processes such as collagen fibrillogenesis, cell adhesion, and migration, contributing to the biomechanical properties of connective tissues (Kudo2017Periostin; Norris2007Periostin). Periostin's expression is modulated by cytokines and mechanical stress, underscoring its role in responding to physiological changes and its involvement in pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Kudo2017Periostin; Coelho2021Expression).

## Structure
Periostin (POSTN) is a secreted extracellular matrix protein with a complex molecular structure. It contains an N-terminal signal sequence, a cysteine-rich EMI domain, and four fasciclin I-like (FAS1) domains. The EMI domain, encoded by exons 2 and 3, is involved in protein-protein interactions and may facilitate periostin dimerization (Hoersch2010Periostin). The FAS1 domains, encoded by exons 3 to 14, are cell adhesion modules with integrin binding motifs located in the second and fourth domains (Hoersch2010Periostin). These domains feature a novel seven-stranded β-wedge and multiple α-helical folds, which are crucial for binding to integrins such as αvβ3, αvβ5, and α6β4, as well as other extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin and collagen (Field2015Novel).

The C-terminal region of periostin is hydrophilic and lacks known domains but is characterized by regions of low compositional complexity and intrinsic disorder. This region undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to periostin's functional diversity (Hoersch2010Periostin). These splice variants are particularly prevalent between exons 17 and 21, affecting the protein's interaction capabilities and biological roles (Kudo2017Introductory). Periostin is also subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function (Field2015Novel).

## Function
Periostin (POSTN) is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in the organization and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells. It is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, which is crucial for the biomechanical properties of connective tissues. Periostin directly binds to collagen Type I, facilitating collagen fibril formation and maturation, and enhancing collagen cross-linking through its interaction with lysyl oxidase (Kudo2017Periostin; Norris2007Periostin). This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of tissues such as skin, tendons, and heart valves (Norris2007Periostin).

Periostin is also involved in cell adhesion and migration, interacting with integrins to promote these processes. It plays a role in tissue repair and remodeling by forming a scaffold with fibronectin and tenascin-C, which supports collagen cross-linking (Kudo2017Periostin). In the heart, periostin is crucial for ECM stabilization and cardiac development, being upregulated during myocardial injury to promote collagen synthesis and ECM reorganization (Snider2008Periostin). Its expression is regulated by cytokines such as TGFβ, which are induced during inflammation or mechanical stress, highlighting its role in responding to physiological changes (Kudo2017Periostin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the POSTN gene, which encodes the protein periostin, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, a short fragment of periostin containing exon 17, produced through aberrant alternative splicing, is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. This fragment is transported from fibroblasts to cancer cells, potentially via exosomes, and plays a significant role in the tumor microenvironment (IkedaIwabu2021Periostin). In papillary thyroid carcinomas, high periostin expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness, including extrathyroidal invasion and distant metastasis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Puppin2008High). 

In colon cancer, periostin is overexpressed in metastatic tumors, enhancing metastatic growth by preventing apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis through the Akt/PKB signaling pathway (Bao2004Periostin). Periostin also plays a role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its knockdown reduces tumor growth and invasion, indicating its involvement in tumor progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Wong2013Periostin). 

In non-cancerous conditions, periostin is associated with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, where its expression is linked to mucosal repair during remission (Coelho2021Expression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of POSTN in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Periostin (POSTN) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of connective tissues. One of its primary interactions is with collagen Type I, where periostin directly binds to it, influencing collagen fibrillogenesis and the biomechanical properties of tissues such as skin, tendons, and heart valves (Norris2007Periostin). This interaction is significant for collagen fibril maturation and assembly, as evidenced by reduced collagen fibril diameter in periostin knockout mice (Norris2007Periostin).

Periostin also interacts with FAM20C, a Golgi casein kinase, which binds to periostin in a kinase-activity independent manner. This interaction occurs within the Fas I domain of periostin, and FAM20C can phosphorylate periostin, suggesting a regulatory role in connective tissue integrity (Lin2020FAM20C).

Additionally, periostin is involved in cell adhesion processes, supporting the attachment and spreading of osteoblast-like cells. This function is facilitated by its homology to fasciclin I, a cell adhesion molecule, and its interaction with integrins such as αvβ3, which is implicated in promoting tumor cell survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Horiuchi1999Identification; Conway2013The).
