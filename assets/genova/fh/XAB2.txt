# XAB2

## Overview
XAB2 is a gene that encodes the XPA binding protein 2, a multifunctional protein involved in several essential cellular processes, including transcription, transcription-coupled DNA repair, and pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is characterized by its composition of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes, categorizing it as a scaffold protein (Onyango2016Tetratricopeptide; Hou2019XAB2). XPA binding protein 2 is a component of a multimeric complex that interacts with RNA polymerase II and spliceosome components, playing a crucial role in RNA processing and genome maintenance (Kuraoka2008Isolation; Goulielmaki2021The). The protein's involvement in maintaining genomic stability and preventing harmful R-loop accumulation underscores its importance in cellular health and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Goulielmaki2021The; Goulielmaki2020The).

## Structure
XAB2 is a human protein characterized by its composition of 15 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes (Onyango2016Tetratricopeptide; Hou2019XAB2). These TPR motifs are arranged in specific regions that are important for its function in homologous recombination, particularly TPR motifs 2-4 and 11-12 (Onyango2016Tetratricopeptide). The TPR domains in XAB2 are suggested to play a role in intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions, which are essential for its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and transcription-coupled repair (Kuraoka2008Isolation).

XAB2 forms a multimeric protein complex with several subunits, including hAquarius, hPRP19, CCDC16, hISY1, and PPIE, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Kuraoka2008Isolation). The protein interacts with RNA polymerase II and is part of the spliceosome complex, indicating its role in RNA processing (Hou2019XAB2; Goulielmaki2021The). XAB2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Onyango2016Tetratricopeptide). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its roles in DNA repair and RNA splicing.

## Function
XAB2 (XPA binding protein 2) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including transcription, transcription-coupled DNA repair, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA export. In healthy human cells, XAB2 is part of a multimeric protein complex that includes subunits such as hAquarius, hPRP19, CCDC16, hISY1, and PPIE, all of which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Kuraoka2008Isolation). XAB2 interacts with RNA polymerase II and is essential for transcription-coupled repair (TCR), a process that rapidly removes lesions on the transcribed strand to resume transcription (Kuraoka2008Isolation).

XAB2 also plays a role in maintaining genome stability by facilitating proper RNA processing and preventing the accumulation of harmful R-loops, which are RNA:DNA hybrids that can lead to transcription stalling and DNA damage (Goulielmaki2020The). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to ensure proper gene expression and cellular health (Hou2016XAB2). XAB2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and responding to DNA damage (Kuraoka2008Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the XAB2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to DNA repair and genomic stability. XAB2 is crucial for the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, and its dysfunction can lead to the accumulation of DNA damage, contributing to conditions such as cancer. For instance, polymorphisms in the XAB2 gene have been associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer, suggesting that genetic variants can influence DNA repair capacity and cancer susceptibility (Xie2021XAB2).

XAB2 is also involved in R-loop processing, and its deficiency can result in increased R-loop formation, leading to DNA breaks and activation of the DNA damage response. This dysfunction is linked to genomic instability, which is a hallmark of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Goulielmaki2021The).

In addition, XAB2 depletion has been shown to induce cellular senescence and cell cycle arrest, with upregulation of p53 and p21, which are known regulators of senescence. This suggests that XAB2 plays a role in cellular aging processes, and its alterations could impact age-related diseases (Hou2019XAB2). The gene's essential role in early development is highlighted by studies showing that its disruption leads to preimplantation lethality in mice, indicating its critical function in embryogenesis (Yonemasu2005Disruption).

## Interactions
XAB2 (XPA binding protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions essential for its role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and pre-mRNA splicing. XAB2 is a component of a multimeric protein complex that includes subunits such as hAquarius (IBP160), hPRP19 (hPSO4), CCDC16, hISY1, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E (PPIE) (Kuraoka2008Isolation). It interacts with the ERCC1-XPF and XPG endonucleases, forming a trimeric complex that binds to RNA:DNA hybrids, particularly under conditions favoring R-loop formation (Goulielmaki2021The). XAB2 also associates with spliceosome components, including U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs, and proteins such as PRP8, PRP19, BCAS2, and SNRP40, which are crucial for pre-mRNA splicing (Goulielmaki2021The; Goulielmaki2020The).

XAB2 interacts with RNA polymerase II, particularly its hyperphosphorylated form, playing a role in transcription elongation (Hou2019XAB2). It is also involved in homologous recombination, interacting with proteins like ISY1 and PRP19, which are important for DNA repair processes (Onyango2016Tetratricopeptide). These interactions highlight XAB2's multifaceted role in RNA processing and genome maintenance.
