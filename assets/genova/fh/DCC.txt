# DCC

## Overview
The DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma) gene encodes the DCC netrin 1 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in axon guidance and cell migration. As a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the DCC protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III domains, facilitating its function as a receptor for the guidance cue netrin-1 (Dun2017Role; Rajasekharan2009The). The receptor is crucial for mediating cellular responses to netrin-1, promoting axonal growth and orientation in the central nervous system, and regulating cell survival in the intestinal epithelium (KeinoMasu1996Deleted; Mehlen2005Role). DCC functions as a dependence receptor, inducing apoptosis in the absence of netrin-1, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Mehlen2005Role). Clinically, DCC is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, with alterations linked to various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancers, as well as other disorders such as congenital mirror movement disorder (RestrepoLozano2022Corticolimbic; Fearon1990Identification).

## Structure
The DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) protein is a type I transmembrane receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its primary structure includes four immunoglobulin (Ig) domains at the N-terminus, followed by six fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains (Dun2017Role; Rajasekharan2009The). The FNIII domains, particularly FNIII4, FNIII5, and FNIII6, are crucial for binding the ligand netrin-1 (Dun2017Role). The protein has a single-pass transmembrane region and a large cytoplasmic tail containing three highly conserved sequence motifs, P1, P2, and P3, which are important for signal transduction (Xu2018The; Dun2017Role).

The secondary structure of DCC involves beta-sheets and alpha-helices, typical of immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains. The tertiary structure is characterized by the arrangement of these domains, forming a horseshoe conformation (Dun2017Role). The quaternary structure involves dimerization upon netrin-1 binding, which is essential for its function in axon guidance (Xu2018The; Rajasekharan2009The).

Post-translational modifications of DCC include glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function. The DCC gene can produce splice variant isoforms, potentially leading to proteins with distinct functions (KeinoMasu1996Deleted).

## Function
The DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma) gene encodes a receptor for netrin-1, a guidance cue involved in axon guidance and cell migration. In healthy human cells, DCC functions as a dependence receptor, which means it can induce apoptosis in the absence of its ligand, netrin-1. This proapoptotic role is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing unwanted cell migration, particularly in the nervous system and intestinal epithelium (Mehlen2005Role).

In the central nervous system, DCC is involved in axon guidance by mediating chemoattraction or repulsion in response to netrin-1. This interaction is essential for the proper growth and orientation of neurons, ensuring that they do not migrate to inappropriate locations (KeinoMasu1996Deleted; Mehlen2005Role). DCC is expressed on axons and growth cones, where it facilitates the outgrowth-promoting effects of netrin-1, particularly in spinal commissural neurons (KeinoMasu1996Deleted).

In the intestinal epithelium, DCC and netrin-1 regulate cell survival. Netrin-1 is produced at the base of the intestinal crypts, protecting proliferating cells from apoptosis. As cells migrate towards the villus tip, where netrin-1 is scarce, DCC induces apoptosis, maintaining the balance of cell proliferation and death (Mehlen2005Role).

## Clinical Significance
The DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma) gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In colorectal cancer, DCC is frequently altered, with one allele deleted in 71% of cases and expression significantly reduced or absent in 88% of colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Somatic mutations, including homozygous deletions and point mutations, are found in 13% of colorectal carcinomas, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Fearon1990Identification).

In gastric cancer, DCC alterations are common, with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) observed in 35.3% of cases, particularly in advanced stages. Loss of expression occurs in 49% of cases, often in the intestinal type of gastric cancer. These alterations are associated with malignant progression and may serve as prognostic factors (Fang1998Loss). Genetic and epigenetic changes, such as promoter methylation and LOH, contribute to reduced DCC expression, supporting the two-hit theory of tumor suppressor gene inactivation (Toda2015Genetic).

DCC is also involved in the development of leiomyosarcomas, where rearrangements and LOH on chromosome 18q are indicative of its role in these tumors (Patterson1994Abnormalities). Additionally, DCC dysfunction is linked to congenital mirror movement disorder, highlighting its significance beyond cancer (RestrepoLozano2022Corticolimbic).

## Interactions
The DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) netrin 1 receptor is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its role in signal transduction. DCC has a domain structure that includes four immunoglobulin domains and six fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats, with the fourth and fifth FNIII repeats specifically required for binding netrin 1. Upon binding netrin 1, DCC undergoes homodimer formation, which is the active form of the receptor, leading to the recruitment of various intracellular signaling molecules. These include members of the Rho family of GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42), Src-family kinases (Src-1, pFyn), the serine/threonine kinase Pak1, the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome related protein family (NWASP), and the Arp2/3 actin-binding complex (Rajasekharan2009The).

DCC also interacts with the Trio GEF, which plays a role in netrin-induced axon guidance by activating Rac1 and Cdc42, essential for changes in growth cone morphology (O’Donnell2009Axon). The receptor is involved in the maintenance of paranodal axoglial junctions in the central nervous system, where it interacts with proteins such as Caspr and neurofascin, contributing to the structural integrity of these regions (Jarjour2008Maintenance). These interactions highlight DCC's role in axon guidance and cellular processes related to cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion.
