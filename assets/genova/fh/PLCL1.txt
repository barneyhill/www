# PLCL1

## Overview
Phospholipase C-like 1 (PLCL1) is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipase C-like 1, which is characterized as an inactive member of the phospholipase C family. Despite its lack of enzymatic activity, the PLCL1 protein functions as a scaffold protein, playing a crucial role in various intracellular signaling pathways. It is involved in modulating the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway and acts as a chelator of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling, thereby influencing processes such as cell survival, differentiation, and apoptosis (Muter2016ProgesteroneDependent). PLCL1 is also implicated in bone health, immune response, and inflammation, interacting with multiple proteins to regulate these pathways (Liu2008Identification; Luo2022PLCL1). Clinically, alterations in the PLCL1 gene have been associated with neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, and various cancers, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Wu2021A; Alharthi2022Complex; Zheng2021GABA).

## Structure


## Function
PLCL1, also known as phospholipase C-like 1, is a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, despite lacking enzymatic activity typical of the phospholipase C family. In human endometrial stromal cells, PLCL1 is highly induced in response to progesterone signaling and functions as a scaffold protein. It modulates the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway, maintaining basal phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT activity, which prevents the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor FOXO1 and the induction of apoptosis (Muter2016ProgesteroneDependent). PLCL1 also acts as a chelator of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling, uncoupling phospholipase C activation from intracellular calcium release, which is crucial for cell survival and differentiation (Muter2016ProgesteroneDependent).

In the context of bone health, PLCL1 is associated with hip bone size variation in females, suggesting a role in bone mechanical sensing by inhibiting IP3-mediated calcium signaling (Liu2008Identification). This function is important for bone cell response to mechanical signals, potentially influencing bone quality and strength (Liu2008Identification). PLCL1's involvement in these pathways highlights its multifaceted role in cellular processes and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLCL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of neurological disorders, rare variants in PLCL1 have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and related conditions such as intellectual disability and developmental delay. Specific genetic variants, including a 542 kb microdeletion and a p.(Met974Ile) substitution, have been identified in patients with ASD, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these disorders (Zheng2021GABA).

PLCL1 is also linked to autoimmune diseases. In a consanguineous Arab family, rare missense variants in PLCL1, along with PAK2 and TAP2, were associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. These variants may disrupt T-cell receptor signaling and antigen processing pathways, contributing to the development of these conditions (Alharthi2022Complex).

In cancer, decreased expression of PLCL1 is associated with poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, correlating with advanced tumor grade and stage (Wu2021A). Additionally, PLCL1 mutations and expression alterations have been linked to stomach adenocarcinoma, influencing drug sensitivity and immune response (Ye2020Bioinformatics). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLCL1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
PLCL1, a protein encoded by the PLCL1 gene, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a scaffold protein, interacting with protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) and the serine/threonine kinase AKT, which are crucial for growth factor signaling (Muter2016ProgesteroneDependent). PLCL1 modulates the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway, preventing the nuclear translocation of FOXO1 and the induction of the apoptotic activator BIM (Muter2016ProgesteroneDependent).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, PLCL1 interacts with NLRP3 inflammasomes, promoting inflammation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Silencing PLCL1 reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, while its overexpression increases them, indicating its role in regulating inflammation through these interactions (Luo2022PLCL1).

PLCL1 is also associated with the GABAergic synapse and T cell receptor signaling pathway, interacting with proteins involved in these processes (Alharthi2022Complex). Additionally, PLCL1 interacts with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CBL, which is connected to T cell activation and immune response regulation (Alharthi2022Complex). These interactions highlight PLCL1's role in various cellular and immune processes.
