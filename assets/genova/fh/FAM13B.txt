# FAM13B

## Overview
FAM13B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 13 member B. This protein is primarily involved in cardiac function, particularly in the regulation of sodium currents, which are essential for maintaining proper cardiac electrophysiology. The FAM13B protein localizes to the plasma membrane and sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes, indicating its role in cardiac muscle structure and function (Tchou2019Causal). Beyond its cardiac implications, FAM13B is also associated with cancer pathologies, notably esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where it participates in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Wang2020Expression). The gene's expression and its regulatory mechanisms have been linked to clinical conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Structure


## Function
The FAM13B gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cardiac function, particularly in the context of atrial fibrillation susceptibility. It is involved in regulating sodium currents, which are crucial for cardiac electrophysiology. Knockdown studies in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have shown that FAM13B affects sodium current density, indicating its importance in maintaining proper cardiac function (Tchou2019Causal). The protein localizes to the plasma membrane and sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes, suggesting its involvement in cardiac muscle structure and function (Tchou2019Causal).

FAM13B is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression within cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of FAM13B results in significant changes in the expression of over 1000 genes, including those involved in sodium current regulation, which aligns with its role in atrial fibrillation susceptibility (Tchou2019Causal). The gene is expressed on the plasma membrane and at the Z-disk in cardiomyocytes, further supporting its role in cardiac muscle structure (Tchou2019Causal). These findings highlight FAM13B's potential role in cardiac health, particularly in maintaining proper sodium current and muscle structure, which are essential for normal heart function.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM13B gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in relation to cardiac and cancer pathologies. Alterations in FAM13B expression have been associated with atrial fibrillation susceptibility. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17171731, located at the chromosome 5q31 locus, has been identified as a causal variant regulating FAM13B expression. The risk allele of this SNP exhibits reduced enhancer activity, leading to decreased FAM13B expression, which in turn affects sodium current properties in cardiomyocytes, potentially contributing to atrial arrhythmogenesis (Tchou2019Causal).

In the context of cancer, FAM13B has been studied for its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Increased expression of FAM13B is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, pathological stage, and clinical stage of ESCC. The gene is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and forms a positive feedback loop with granulin (GRN), enhancing cancer-promoting functions such as cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. This suggests that FAM13B plays a critical role in the malignant transformation of esophageal lesions (Wang2020Expression). These findings highlight the potential of FAM13B as a biomarker and therapeutic target in these diseases.
