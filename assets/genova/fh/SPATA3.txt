# SPATA3

## Overview
SPATA3, or spermatogenesis associated 3, is a gene that encodes a protein primarily involved in the process of spermatogenesis, which is essential for the development and maturation of sperm cells. The SPATA3 protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved PEST domain, which is often associated with roles in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, suggesting its involvement in critical cellular processes necessary for sperm development (Zhou2019Characterization). Predominantly expressed in the testis, SPATA3 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in male reproductive biology (Zhou2019Characterization). Despite its specific expression and potential significance, the precise molecular functions of SPATA3 remain largely unexplored, although it has been implicated in male infertility and interactions with proteins from pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii (Girault2021Deletion; Wang2016Identification).

## Structure
The SPATA3 gene encodes a protein involved in spermatogenesis, with several isoforms identified through molecular cloning and characterization studies. The primary structure of SPATA3 includes multiple isoforms, such as SPATA3-I1, SPATA3-I2, SPATA3-I3, and SPATA3-I4, which vary in base pair lengths and amino acid sequences. SPATA3-I2 was previously reported, while SPATA3-I3 and SPATA3-I4 are novel isoforms identified in recent studies (Zhou2019Characterization).

A notable feature of the SPATA3 protein is the presence of a conserved PEST domain, specifically the QQP-SPESTP domain, which is thought to play a role in spermatogenesis and male development. This domain is characterized by variable repeats across different isoforms and species, indicating its potential functional significance (Zhou2019Characterization).

The SPATA3 protein is highly conserved across several species and is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting its critical role in male reproductive development. However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SPATA3, as well as any post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available literature (Zhou2019Characterization).

## Function
The SPATA3 gene, also known as spermatogenesis associated 3, is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in the process of spermatogenesis, which is crucial for the development and maturation of sperm cells. The protein encoded by SPATA3 is localized to the acrosome region of sperm cells, a critical area involved in fertilization (Girault2021Deletion). Although the exact molecular function of SPATA3 in healthy human cells remains largely unknown, it is suggested to play a role in spermatogenesis cell apoptosis and may be involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis (Zhou2019Characterization).

SPATA3 contains a conserved PEST domain, which is often associated with proteins that have a role in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, suggesting its potential involvement in cellular processes essential for sperm development (Zhou2019Characterization). Despite its specific expression in the testis, the function of SPATA3 is not fully understood, as it does not share sequence similarity with other proteins in the SPATA family (Girault2021Deletion). The gene's expression is down-regulated in infertile men with nonobstructive azoospermia, indicating its potential role in male fertility (Malcher2013Potential).

## Clinical Significance
The SPATA3 gene has been implicated in several reproductive health issues, particularly male infertility. In humans, SPATA3 is among the most down-regulated genes in the testis of infertile men diagnosed with nonobstructive azoospermia, a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in the ejaculate due to impaired sperm production (Girault2021Deletion). This suggests that alterations in SPATA3 expression may contribute to certain forms of male infertility.

In mouse models, deletion of the Spata3 gene results in significant sperm alterations, including acrosome defects and an overabundance of lipid droplets in cytoplasmic remnants, which lead to reduced efficiency in in vitro fertilization assays. These findings indicate that while Spata3 is not essential for in vivo fertility, it plays a crucial role in sperm function under artificial conditions (Girault2021Deletion). The study suggests that SPATA3 may be involved in conditions such as globozoospermia, characterized by round-shaped sperm heads with acrosome abnormalities (Girault2021Deletion).

Additionally, rare variants of the SPATA3 gene have been associated with prostate cancer, although the specific mechanisms and implications of these associations require further investigation (Girault2021Deletion).

## Interactions
SPATA3, a gene associated with spermatogenesis, has been identified to interact with the Toxoplasma gondii micronemal protein MIC3. This interaction was confirmed through various experimental methods, including yeast two-hybrid assays, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells. The yeast two-hybrid assay initially identified several proteins, but only SPATA3, Dkk2, and two uncharacterized proteins showed true interactions with MIC3 (Wang2016Identification). The GST pull-down assay demonstrated that His-tagged SPATA3 specifically interacted with GST-MIC3, confirming the binding (Wang2016Identification). In mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation assays further validated that Myc-MIC3 could coprecipitate with YFP-tagged SPATA3 (Wang2016Identification).

Additionally, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC) was used to visualize these interactions in live cells, showing that SPATA3 interacts with MIC3 in the cytoplasm (Wang2016Identification). The study also highlighted the importance of the EGF domain of MIC3 in mediating these interactions, as it was critical for binding to host proteins, including SPATA3 (Wang2016Identification). These findings suggest that SPATA3 is a significant interacting partner of MIC3, with potential implications for understanding host-pathogen interactions in Toxoplasma gondii infections.
