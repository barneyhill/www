# ALKBH2

## Overview
The ALKBH2 gene encodes the alkB homolog 2, alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, a critical enzyme involved in the repair of alkylated DNA lesions. This protein belongs to the AlkB family of non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases and is characterized by its jelly-roll beta-barrel fold, which is typical for enzymes in this family (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational). ALKBH2 plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing alkylated bases such as 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine through an oxidative demethylation mechanism (Wilson2018Fluorescence). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing mutations and ensuring proper cellular function, particularly during DNA replication and cell division (Ke2020ALKBH2). ALKBH2's interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is essential for its function in DNA repair, and alterations in its expression have significant implications in cancer, particularly in the context of chemotherapy resistance (Fu2015The; Johannessen2012The).

## Structure
The ALKBH2 protein is a member of the AlkB family of non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases, characterized by a jelly-roll beta-barrel fold, which is typical for this enzyme family (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational). The protein structure includes a conserved double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, which is common among 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent dioxygenases (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational). The primary structure of ALKBH2 features a poorly ordered N-terminal domain, a DSBH catalytic core, and a nucleotide recognition lid (NRL motif) connected by specific loop regions (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational).

The active site of ALKBH2 contains a highly conserved 2-His-1-Asp triad (His-171, Asp-173, and His-236) that coordinates the Fe(II) ion, essential for its enzymatic activity (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational). The protein also includes a β3-β4 hairpin motif, which is crucial for base flipping during DNA repair, with Phe-102 playing a significant role in this process (Chen2013The; Lenz2020Insights). ALKBH2 interacts with damaged DNA using a short positively charged RKK loop and a long loop motif to hold the complementary strand (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational).

The protein's interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is mediated by an ALKBH2-PCNA interacting motif (APIM) located in the first seven amino acid residues, which is crucial for its function during DNA replication (Fu2015The). The structure of ALKBH2 and its complex with damaged DNA has been primarily studied using X-ray crystallography, providing insights into its conformational dynamics during the DNA repair process (Kanazhevskaya2022Conformational).

## Function
ALKBH2 is a crucial enzyme in DNA repair, specifically targeting alkylated DNA lesions such as 1-methyladenine (m1A) and 3-methylcytosine (m3C). It functions as an Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, primarily acting on double-stranded DNA substrates. This enzyme plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing these alkylated bases, thereby preventing mutations and ensuring proper cellular function (Wilson2018Fluorescence). ALKBH2 operates through an oxidative demethylation mechanism, which involves the removal of methyl groups from DNA bases, restoring them to their normal state and preventing cytotoxicity (Ke2020ALKBH2).

In healthy human cells, ALKBH2 is active in the cell nucleus, where it helps preserve DNA integrity. This activity is essential for processes such as cell division and organismal development, as it prevents transcriptional errors and error-prone replication bypass that could lead to genomic instability (Wilson2018Fluorescence). The enzyme's function is vital for preventing the accumulation of DNA damage, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer, if left unrepaired (Ke2020ALKBH2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ALKBH2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, ALKBH2 is overexpressed and contributes to resistance against the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. This resistance is mediated by ALKBH2's role in repairing methylating agent-induced DNA damage, which temozolomide targets. Silencing ALKBH2 expression in GBM cells increases their sensitivity to temozolomide, suggesting that targeting ALKBH2 could enhance treatment efficacy (Johannessen2012The).

In non-small cell lung cancer, downregulation of ALKBH2 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy, while upregulation in glioblastoma contributes to drug resistance (Ougland2015Nonhomologous). ALKBH2 mutations or altered expression have also been identified in pediatric brain tumors and gastric cancers, indicating its role in cancer progression and resistance mechanisms (Ougland2015Nonhomologous).

ALKBH2's expression level is a significant prognostic biomarker in GBM, with higher transcription levels associated with poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that ALKBH2 not only influences chemotherapy resistance but also impacts overall disease prognosis (Feng2022The).

## Interactions
ALKBH2, a human DNA repair enzyme, interacts directly with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction is mediated by a hydrophobic pocket on PCNA, which is crucial for the binding of ALKBH2. The interaction is specific to ALKBH2, as its homolog ALKBH3 does not bind to PCNA due to the absence of a PCNA-interacting motif. Mutations in PCNA that disrupt the hydrophobic pocket significantly reduce ALKBH2 binding, while mutations on the backside of PCNA do not affect the interaction. This interaction is confirmed in human cells, where ALKBH2 tagged at the carboxy terminus interacts with endogenous PCNA, but tagging at the amino terminus disrupts the interaction, likely due to steric hindrance (Fu2015The).

The ALKBH2-PCNA interaction does not change with DNA damage but increases during the S-phase of the cell cycle, suggesting a role in DNA replication. Naturally occurring variants of ALKBH2, such as A9V and Q10K, can alter this interaction, with the Q10K variant showing a significant increase in PCNA binding (Fu2015The). ALKBH2 is also involved in mediating resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide in glioblastoma cells, where its interaction with PCNA is facilitated by an ALKBH2 PCNA-interacting motif (Johannessen2012The).
