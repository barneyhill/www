# BOLA1

## Overview
BOLA1 is a gene that encodes the protein bolA family member 1, which is a member of the BolA-like protein family. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria and plays a significant role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and the regulation of thiol redox potential, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (Willems2013BOLA1). BOLA1 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, which are crucial for the function of various mitochondrial enzymes (Uzarska2016Mitochondrial). The protein forms a heterodimeric complex with the mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5, bridged by a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is essential for maintaining the reduced state of mitochondrial proteins even when glutathione levels are low (Willems2013BOLA1; Nasta2017Structural). This interaction suggests a specialized role in redox processes rather than general oxidative stress response, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Sen2020Cluster).

## Structure
The BOLA1 protein is a member of the BolA-like protein family and is involved in the coordination of iron-sulfur ([2Fe-2S]) clusters. The primary structure of BOLA1 includes a sequence pattern with potential cluster ligands, specifically the motif HX8HX18HX15H, where the C-terminal histidine is conserved across BolA-like proteins (Nasta2017Structural). In terms of secondary structure, BOLA1 forms a heterodimeric complex with glutaredoxin 5 (GRX5), bridged by a [2Fe-2S] cluster, although specific details on its secondary structure elements like alpha helices or beta sheets are not explicitly provided (Nasta2017Structural).

The quaternary structure of BOLA1 involves its interaction with GRX5, forming a compact complex where the β-sheet of BOLA1 is at the protein-protein interface, affecting the cluster's surface exposure (Nasta2017Structural). This structural arrangement influences the potential for cluster ligand-exchange reactions. The BOLA1-GRX5 complex stabilizes a reduced [2Fe-2S] 1+ cluster, which is capable of electron transfer reactions, indicating a role in redox processes (Nasta2017Structural). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of BOLA1 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The BOLA1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and regulating the thiol redox potential, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress (Willems2013BOLA1). BOLA1 is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, which are essential for the function of various mitochondrial enzymes, including those involved in the citric acid cycle and amino acid metabolism (Uzarska2016Mitochondrial). The protein interacts with the mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5, forming a stable complex that helps maintain the reduced state of mitochondrial proteins even when glutathione (GSH) levels are low (Willems2013BOLA1; Uzarska2016Mitochondrial).

BOLA1's function in healthy human cells includes reducing the oxidation of mitochondrial thiol groups, particularly under conditions of glutathione depletion, and maintaining mitochondrial morphology (Willems2013BOLA1). Overexpression of BOLA1 can attenuate the oxidative effects of glutathione depletion on the mitochondrial thiol redox potential, suggesting a protective role against oxidative stress (Willems2013BOLA1). BOLA1 is not upregulated under oxidative stress conditions, indicating a specific role in thiol oxidation rather than a general oxidative stress response (Willems2013BOLA1).

## Interactions
BOLA1, a member of the BolA-like protein family, interacts with the mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5. This interaction forms a [2Fe-2S] cluster-bridged heterodimeric complex, which is suggested to have a redox role rather than a cluster trafficking role (Sen2020Cluster). The BOLA1-GLRX5 complex is characterized by its stability and ability to form readily when apo BOLA1 or apo GLRX5 is added to the holo partner, indicating a thermodynamically favorable interaction (Sen2020Cluster). 

The interaction between BOLA1 and GLRX5 is supported by experimental evidence showing that BOLA1 copurifies with GLRX5 in HEK293 T-REx cells, suggesting a physical interaction (Willems2013BOLA1). This complex is involved in maintaining mitochondrial thiol redox potential, as BOLA1 overexpression can attenuate oxidative effects caused by glutathione depletion (Willems2013BOLA1). 

BOLA1 also plays a role in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins, particularly in the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into mitochondrial target apoproteins, in cooperation with GLRX5 (Uzarska2016Mitochondrial). The BOLA1-GLRX5 complex does not transfer its cluster to acceptors such as ferredoxins, indicating a distinct function from other BOLA family members (Sen2020Cluster).
