# OR5G3

## Overview
The OR5G3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily G member 3, which is involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is categorized as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), a large family of transmembrane receptors that play a crucial role in signal transduction by interacting with G proteins. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR5G3, are responsible for the initial molecular interactions that lead to the perception of smell. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and are integral to the olfactory system's ability to detect a wide range of odorants. The OR5G3 gene is part of a large gene family, which is the largest in the human genome, dedicated to olfactory reception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
