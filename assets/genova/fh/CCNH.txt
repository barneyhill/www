# CCNH

## Overview
The CCNH gene encodes cyclin H, a regulatory protein that is integral to cell cycle control and transcriptional regulation. Cyclin H is a member of the cyclin family, characterized by its conserved cyclin box domain, which facilitates its interaction with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wood2018Structural). Cyclin H forms a complex with CDK7 and MAT1, known as the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of other CDKs, thereby promoting cell cycle progression (Wood2018Structural). Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, cyclin H is involved in transcription by activating RNA polymerase II, a process crucial for gene expression and DNA repair (Nigg1995Cyclin‐dependent). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in cancer pathogenesis, where alterations in CCNH expression have been linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Zhang2015Interaction).

## Structure
Cyclin H (CCNH) is a member of the cyclin family, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Structurally, cyclin H is characterized by a conserved cyclin box domain, which is essential for its function in forming complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Wood2018Structural). Cyclin H forms a complex with CDK7 and MAT1, known as the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which is vital for the activation of other CDKs through phosphorylation (Wood2018Structural).

The secondary structure of cyclin H includes a shorter α4 helix and a loop linking α4-α5, which, along with the displacement of the N-terminal end of α5, remodels its structure around a key residue, R63. This structural adaptation suggests that cyclin H, like other transcriptional cyclins, utilizes alternative surfaces within its cyclin box fold (CBF) for protein-protein interactions (Wood2018Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to regulate the activity of cyclin H, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Wood2018Structural). The structural features of cyclin H contribute to its role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in the CAK complex.

## Function
Cyclin H (CCNH) is a regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by forming a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and MAT1, known as the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). This complex is essential for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) through phosphorylation, a necessary step for cell cycle progression. Cyclin H, as part of the CAK complex, phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue in CDKs, which is essential for their full activation (Fisher1994A). 

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, cyclin H is involved in transcription regulation by activating RNA polymerase II. The CDK7/cyclin H complex is associated with the human TFIIH complex, which is required for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and DNA repair. This complex phosphorylates the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the initiation of transcription (Nigg1995Cyclin‐dependent). Cyclin H is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cell division and gene expression, contributing to the orderly progression of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells (Eki1998Mapping).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNH gene, which encodes Cyclin H, have been implicated in various cancers. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high expression levels of CCNH, along with CDK7 and CtBP2, are associated with lymph node metastasis and decreased E-cadherin expression, contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis (Zhang2015Interaction). This interaction is crucial for promoting ESCC cell migration, suggesting that CCNH plays a significant role in cancer progression and poor prognosis (Zhang2015Interaction).

In breast cancer, the CCNH/CDK7 complex stabilizes CtBP2, enhancing its pro-metastatic functions by preventing its phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. This stabilization promotes cancer cell migration and invasion, indicating that the CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis could be a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies (Wang2013Interaction).

Additionally, the CCNH gene variant rs2230641 has been associated with an increased risk of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). This polymorphism, located in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, suggests that genetic variations in CCNH may influence individual susceptibility to thyroid cancer (SANTOS2013The).

## Interactions
Cyclin H (CCNH) is known to interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) to form the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which also includes MAT1. This complex is crucial for the activation of other CDKs through phosphorylation, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control (Klein2020Cyclindependent). 

CCNH, in conjunction with CDK7, has been shown to interact with the C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2). This interaction stabilizes CtBP2 by preventing its proteasomal degradation, which is important for CtBP2's role in promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. The CCNH/CDK7 complex competes with the tumor suppressor HIPK2 for binding to CtBP2, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation (Wang2013Interaction). 

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the interaction between CCNH/CDK7 and CtBP2 is associated with enhanced cancer cell migration through the upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. This interaction is crucial for CtBP2's role in promoting metastasis, suggesting that the CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis could be a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2015Interaction).
