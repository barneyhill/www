# HDGFL3

## Overview
HDGFL3, or Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the HDGF family, which is known for its involvement in nuclear targeting and transcriptional regulation. The HDGF like 3 protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival, functioning in both the nucleus and cytoplasm to influence gene expression and cellular growth pathways. This protein is implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including its potential role in diseases like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, and developmental disorders associated with prenatal Zika virus exposure. Additionally, HDGFL3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for well-differentiated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, underscoring its clinical relevance (RosaFernandes2022Global; Zhao2024Causal; Azimi2020Proteomics:; Bukosza2020ECM).

## Function
HDGFL3, or Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This protein is a member of the HDGF family, which is recognized for its role in nuclear targeting and transcriptional regulation. HDGFL3 is active in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular growth pathways. By participating in these processes, HDGFL3 plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions and supporting organismal development. The protein's activity in the nucleus suggests its involvement in regulating transcription, which is essential for controlling the expression of genes that drive cell growth and division. In the cytoplasm, HDGFL3 may interact with other cellular components to modulate signaling pathways that are crucial for cell survival and differentiation. Through these molecular activities, HDGFL3 contributes to the proper functioning of healthy human cells, ensuring that they grow and differentiate appropriately in response to physiological cues.

## Clinical Significance
HDGFL3 (HDGF like 3) has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HDGFL3 is notably downregulated, with a fold change of -5.2, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Bukosza2020ECM). In type-2 diabetes (T2D), HDGFL3 is highly upregulated in the prediabetic state, indicating its involvement in the disease's progression, particularly affecting β-cell function and insulin signaling pathways (Zhao2024Causal).

In the context of prenatal exposure to the Zika virus, HDGFL3 is upregulated in infants exposed to the virus, which may contribute to the gene dysregulation associated with Zika virus exposure and its related developmental disorders (RosaFernandes2022Global). Additionally, HDGFL3 has been identified as a potential protein marker for well-differentiated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (WD-cSCC), highlighting its role in cancer diagnosis and classification (Azimi2020Proteomics:). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HDGFL3 in various pathological conditions, although specific mutations or detailed interaction alterations have not been extensively documented in the provided context.
