# TMEM132A

## Overview
TMEM132A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 132A, a type I single-pass transmembrane protein involved in cellular signaling and adhesion. This protein is characterized by its structure, which includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a conserved region with bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:; Li2020TMEM132A). TMEM132A is notably implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it interacts with key components such as Wntless (WLS) and LRP6, stabilizing Wnt ligands and preventing degradation of signaling molecules (Oh2024TMEM132A; Li2020TMEM132A). The gene is expressed predominantly in the brain and is associated with neural adhesion and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, suggesting a role in neuronal cell survival and stress response regulation (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:). Alterations in TMEM132A expression or function have been linked to developmental and neurological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Oh2024TMEM132A).

## Structure
The TMEM132A protein is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein consisting of 1,018 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-32), an N-terminus (amino acids 33-844), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 845-867), and a C-terminus (amino acids 868-1,018) (Li2020TMEM132A). The protein features a conserved region between amino acids 400 and 767, which includes three consecutive bacterial immunoglobulin-like (BIG) domains, forming a beta-sandwich fold composed of nine strands (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:). TMEM132A also contains a cohesin domain, a protein-protein interaction module (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

The protein's secondary structure is characterized by these immunoglobulin-like domains, which are part of the beta-sandwich fold. TMEM132A is capable of forming homodimers or oligomers, primarily through its N-terminal domain, indicating a quaternary structure involving self-interaction (Li2020TMEM132A). The protein is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, interacting with Wntless (WLS) and stabilizing Wnt ligands, which suggests a role in cellular signaling and adhesion (Li2020TMEM132A). TMEM132A is expressed in the brain and is associated with neural adhesion and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

## Function
TMEM132A is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. TMEM132A interacts with Wntless (WLS), a protein involved in the trafficking of Wnt ligands, enhancing the stability and interaction of WLS with Wnt ligands such as WNT3A and WNT5A. This interaction is essential for the proper trafficking and secretion of Wnt ligands from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, facilitating efficient Wnt signal production (Li2020TMEM132A).

TMEM132A also stabilizes β-Catenin in the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway by preventing its phosphorylation and degradation, which is crucial for the activation of target genes like Axin2 and Cyclin D1 (Li2020TMEM132A). Additionally, TMEM132A stabilizes the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, preventing its lysosomal degradation, which is vital for maintaining Wnt signaling during embryonic development (Oh2024TMEM132A).

In healthy human cells, TMEM132A is thought to function as a cell adhesion molecule, connecting the extracellular environment with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton, and may promote neuronal cell survival by regulating stress-related genes (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TMEM132A gene have been linked to several developmental and neurological conditions. In mouse models, loss of TMEM132A function leads to developmental defects such as spina bifida, syndactyly, and renal anomalies, which are associated with impaired Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Oh2024TMEM132A). TMEM132A is crucial for stabilizing LRP6, a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway, and its deficiency results in decreased levels of LRP6 and β-catenin, leading to developmental disorders (Oh2024TMEM132A).

TMEM132A also interacts with Wntless (WLS), a protein involved in Wnt ligand trafficking, and its depletion results in reduced levels of Wnt ligands such as WNT3A and WNT5A. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal Wnt signaling, and disruptions can lead to increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, potentially contributing to neural tube defects like spina bifida (Li2020TMEM132A).

While specific human diseases directly linked to TMEM132A mutations are not detailed in the provided context, the gene's role in critical signaling pathways suggests its potential involvement in various developmental and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
TMEM132A is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway. It interacts with Wntless (WLS), a protein essential for Wnt ligand trafficking. This interaction is facilitated by the transmembrane domain of TMEM132A, which is critical for binding with WLS. The interaction enhances the stability and transport of Wnt ligands, such as WNT3A and WNT5A, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting Wnt signaling (Li2020TMEM132A).

TMEM132A also interacts with LRP6, a co-receptor in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction stabilizes LRP6 by preventing its lysosomal degradation, which is essential for maintaining Wnt signaling activity. The stabilization of LRP6 by TMEM132A is crucial for proper embryonic development, as it influences processes like neural tube closure and limb development (Oh2024TMEM132A).

These interactions highlight TMEM132A's role as a regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, impacting both the canonical and non-canonical pathways. The protein's ability to stabilize key components of the Wnt pathway underscores its importance in cellular signaling and developmental processes (Oh2024TMEM132A; Li2020TMEM132A).
