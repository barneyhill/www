# PDGFRL

## Overview
The PDGFRL gene encodes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein, which is categorized as a tumor suppressor protein. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, which are crucial for cartilage development and maintenance. PDGFRL is thought to function by interacting with various factors, potentially acting as a decoy to inhibit pathways that promote differentiation. Beyond its role in cartilage biology, PDGFRL is implicated in the tumor suppressor network, influencing cell growth and differentiation across multiple tissues. Its expression and function are modulated in different cell types, highlighting its versatile role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Kawata2017A).

## Function
The PDGFRL gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that plays a crucial role in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In healthy human cells, particularly in chondrocytes, PDGFRL is involved in maintaining a proliferating chondrocytic phenotype by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting the expression of chondrocyte differentiation marker genes. This regulation is essential for the proper development and maintenance of cartilage tissue, as it ensures a balance between proliferation and differentiation, which is necessary for the growth of long bones (Kawata2017A).

PDGFRL functions by potentially binding to multiple factors, such as CCN2 and PDGFs, acting as a decoy to inhibit pathways that promote chondrocyte differentiation. This interaction is vital for the regulation of molecular behavior in cartilage biology (Kawata2017A). The gene's expression is highest among proliferating and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, suggesting its role in counteracting early terminal differentiation (Kawata2017A).

In addition to its role in cartilage, PDGFRL is implicated in the tumor suppressor network, influencing cell growth and differentiation across various tissues (Kawata2017A). Its expression and function are modulated in different cell types, indicating a versatile role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Kawata2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDGFRL gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and cancers. In the context of autoimmune diseases, PDGFRL has been associated with Behçet disease in Chinese Han populations. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17633132, has shown a significant association with this condition, suggesting that PDGFRL may be a shared risk factor for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome (Hou2012Genetic; Gao2022Genetics).

In cancer, PDGFRL is considered a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often decreased in breast cancer cells, and mutations in PDGFRL have been identified in various cancer samples, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (Hou2012Genetic; Xu2008An). In bladder cancer, high expression of PDGFRL is associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, where it correlates with disease progression (Kim2015The). Additionally, PDGFRL is involved in the tumor suppressor network in breast cancer, where it plays a central role in inhibiting PDGF signaling, which is crucial for tumor invasiveness (Xu2008An).

PDGFRL's role in neurofibromatosis type-1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) has also been noted, with specific copy number alterations in the gene suggesting its involvement in the malignant transformation of benign neurofibromas (Upadhyaya2012Microarraybased).

## Interactions
PDGFRL, a tumor suppressor protein, is involved in various cellular interactions that influence cell proliferation and differentiation. It is hypothesized to function by binding to multiple factors, potentially including CCN2 and PDGFs, which may vary between cell types (Kawata2017A). CCN2 is known to have differential effects on cell proliferation and interacts with various molecules, leading to diverse biological outcomes. PDGFRL might act as a decoy, inhibiting pathways that promote chondrocyte differentiation by binding to multiple ligands (Kawata2017A).

In the context of cancer, PDGFRL is noted for its potential role in tumor suppression through the inhibition of PDGF signaling. It encodes a product with significant sequence similarity to the extracellular domain of PDGFR, suggesting an agonistic function to PDGFR signaling (Xu2008An). The gene is located in a region associated with a putative breast cancer tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in PDGFRL have been found in cancer samples (Xu2008An).

PDGFRL is also implicated in brain pericyte-specific functions, with its soluble form reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients with nervous system involvement, suggesting a potential interaction pathway for SARS-CoV-2 infection in brain pericytes (Lin2023Genomewide).
