# C11orf54

## Overview
C11orf54 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 54. This protein functions as an ester hydrolase and is highly conserved across species, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes related to DNA repair and autophagy. The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various human tissues, with notably higher levels in the kidney and liver (Tan2023C11orf54). C11orf54 is involved in maintaining genomic stability by preventing the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) through its interaction with the heat-shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (HSC70), thereby influencing the transcription of key enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and repair (Tan2023C11orf54). Its role in DNA repair and potential as a biomarker in cancer biology underscore its clinical significance, particularly in the context of enhancing the efficacy of DNA-damaging agents (Tan2023C11orf54).

## Structure


## Function
C11orf54 encodes a protein that functions as an ester hydrolase and is highly conserved across species. In healthy human cells, C11orf54 plays a crucial role in promoting DNA repair by blocking chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-mediated degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) (Tan2023C11orf54). This interaction prevents the degradation of HIF1A, which is essential for the transcription of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), a key enzyme for DNA synthesis and repair (Tan2023C11orf54). The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various human tissues, with higher levels in the kidney and liver (Tan2023C11orf54).

C11orf54's role in DNA repair is further supported by its ability to maintain genome stability. Knockdown of C11orf54 results in increased DNA damage and apoptosis, as well as reduced expression of Rad51, a critical protein in homologous recombination repair (Tan2023C11orf54). The protein interacts with HSC70, preventing HIF1A from being targeted for degradation, thereby influencing DNA repair mechanisms and autophagy pathways (Tan2023C11orf54). Overall, C11orf54 is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and cell survival, particularly under conditions of genotoxic stress (Tan2023C11orf54).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf54, also known as PTD012, has been identified as a biomarker for certain cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. Alterations in its expression levels have significant implications for cancer biology. Knockdown of C11orf54 has been shown to decrease cell proliferation and enhance DNA damage and apoptosis, particularly in the context of cisplatin treatment, due to its role in homologous recombination repair (Tan2023C11orf54). This gene interacts with HSC70, influencing the degradation of HIF1A via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The degradation of HIF1A leads to reduced transcription of RRM2, a key enzyme in DNA synthesis and repair, which results in increased DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation (Tan2023C11orf54).

C11orf54 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various human tissues, with higher levels in the kidney and liver. Its deficiency suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis, indicating its role in cell survival, particularly in response to genotoxic stress (Tan2023C11orf54). The gene's involvement in DNA repair and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment highlight its clinical significance, especially in enhancing the efficacy of DNA-damaging agents (Tan2023C11orf54).

## Interactions
C11orf54 is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins that influence DNA repair processes. It competitively interacts with the heat-shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (HSC70), which is crucial for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). This interaction affects the binding of HSC70 to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A). When C11orf54 is knocked down, HSC70 binds more to HIF1A, leading to its degradation via CMA. This degradation of HIF1A subsequently reduces the transcription of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), a key enzyme for DNA synthesis and repair (Tan2023C11orf54).

C11orf54 contains KFERQ-like motifs, which are recognized by HSC70 for targeting proteins to lysosomes for degradation. The interaction between C11orf54 and HSC70 was confirmed through endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assays (Tan2023C11orf54). C11orf54's interaction with HSC70 is significant in its role in DNA repair and autophagy regulation (Tan2023C11orf54). These interactions highlight C11orf54's role in regulating DNA damage and repair through its influence on the HIF1A/RRM2 axis and Rad51 expression (Tan2023C11orf54).
