# PGC

## Overview
Progastricsin (PGC) is a gene that encodes the protein progastricsin, an aspartic protease primarily involved in the digestive processes within the stomach. Progastricsin is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, which is activated in the acidic environment of the gastric lumen to form pepsin C, a key enzyme in protein digestion. The PGC gene is predominantly expressed in gastric chief cells, and its product plays a significant role in breaking down dietary proteins into peptides and amino acids, facilitating nutrient absorption. Beyond its digestive functions, progastricsin is implicated in various physiological processes, including gastric mucosa healing and antimicrobial activity. Clinically, alterations in PGC expression and mutations are associated with gastric cancer and other malignancies, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment (De2021Polymorphisms; Shen2017Pepsinogen; Ding2024Pepsinogen).

## Structure
Progastricsin (PGC) is a pepsinogen-like aspartic protease primarily expressed in the stomach. The primary structure of PGC consists of a polypeptide chain of approximately 370 amino acids, with a prosegment at the N-terminus ranging from 35 to 49 residues. This prosegment is highly basic, while the active enzyme moiety is negatively charged due to numerous Asp and Glu residues (RICHTER1998Mechanism).

The secondary structure of PGC includes β-sheet structures, which are predominant in the active enzyme portion. The tertiary structure is bilobal, with a large active-site cleft between the lobes, characteristic of aspartic proteinases. This cleft accommodates substrate binding and contains two catalytic aspartate residues, Asp32 and Asp215, essential for enzyme activity (Kageyama2002Pepsinogens; RICHTER1998Mechanism).

PGC undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may influence its stability and activity (Kageyama2002Pepsinogens). The activation of PGC involves the removal of the prosegment, which is crucial for maintaining the zymogen in its inactive form at neutral pH. This process occurs through conformational changes and proteolytic cleavage at acidic pH levels (RICHTER1998Mechanism).

## Function
Progastricsin (PGC) is a digestive enzyme precursor primarily expressed in the gastric mucosa, where it plays a crucial role in protein digestion. In healthy human cells, PGC is synthesized by gastric chief cells and secreted into the gastric lumen. Under acidic conditions, it is activated to pepsin C, which facilitates the breakdown of dietary proteins into peptides and amino acids, aiding nutrient absorption (Shen2017Pepsinogen; Ding2024Pepsinogen). 

PGC is involved in the hydrolysis of various peptides, including b-endorphin and insulin B chain, and shows high specificity for the cleavage of X-Phe bonds (Hassan2010Progastriscin:). The enzyme is active in the acidic environment of the stomach, where it contributes to the digestive process by converting proteins into smaller polypeptides (RICHTER1998Mechanism). 

Beyond its digestive role, PGC is implicated in other physiological processes, such as gastric mucosa healing and antimicrobial activity in the gastrointestinal tract (Shen2017Pepsinogen). It is also involved in lung maturation by hydrolyzing pro-surfactant protein B and may play a role in reproduction by reducing the vaginal immune load (Shen2017Pepsinogen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PGC gene, which encodes Pepsinogen C, have significant clinical implications, particularly in gastric cancer (GC). High serum levels of Pepsinogen II, a product of the PGC gene, are associated with an increased risk of GC and are influenced by Helicobacter pylori infection and specific genetic polymorphisms. Notably, the rs9471643 SNP in the PGC gene is linked to increased PGII expression and may have a protective role against GC development (De2021Polymorphisms).

PGC expression is also implicated in various cancers beyond the stomach. It is associated with higher survival rates in certain cancers, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, but is a poor prognostic factor in lung squamous cell carcinoma (Shen2020The). In gastric cancer cells, PGC overexpression has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis by interacting with IQGAP1 and suppressing the Rho-GTPase pathway, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Ding2024Pepsinogen).

The PGC gene's expression and mutation rates vary across different cancer types, with notable mutations in stomach adenocarcinoma and endometrial carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment (Shen2020The).
