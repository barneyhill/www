# CXorf51A

## Overview
The CXorf51A gene encodes the protein chromosome X open reading frame 51A, which is classified as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). This protein is composed of 108 amino acids and is notable for its lack of stable secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure under physiological conditions, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and bioinformatics analyses (Wiedemann2021Backbone). Despite its disordered nature, CXorf51A contains a small region in its C-terminal that may serve as a molecular recognition feature, potentially adopting a more ordered structure upon interaction with other molecules (Wiedemann2021Backbone). The protein's structure is enriched with basic residues and may be subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could modulate its function and interactions (Wiedemann2021Backbone).

## Structure
The human protein CXorf51A, encoded by the CXorf51A gene, is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with a primary structure consisting of 108 amino acids. It has a high content of basic residues such as lysine and arginine, as well as serine and threonine, which are common in IDPs (Wiedemann2021Backbone). The protein lacks significant secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure under the conditions studied, as indicated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and bioinformatics analyses (Wiedemann2021Backbone). 

The secondary structure propensity analysis suggests minimal secondary structure content, with a small region in the C-terminal part showing potential local order, possibly acting as a molecular recognition feature that could fold upon binding (Wiedemann2021Backbone). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its structural dynamics. Several potential phosphorylation sites have been identified, suggesting possible regulation by kinases (Wiedemann2021Backbone). No specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms have been reported for CXorf51A in the available literature.
