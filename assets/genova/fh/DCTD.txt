# DCTD

## Overview
The DCTD gene encodes the enzyme deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase, which is a critical component of nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the deamination of deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), a key step in the synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor for DNA synthesis and repair (Wu2019Overexpression). As a cytoplasmic enzyme, dCMP deaminase plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools, thereby ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and genomic stability (Wu2019Overexpression). Alterations in DCTD expression have been linked to various clinical outcomes, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance (Wu2019Overexpression; Hu2017Gene).

## Function
DCTD, or deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the deamination of deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP). This reaction is essential for the synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), a precursor necessary for DNA synthesis and repair (Wu2019Overexpression). DCTD activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain the balance of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools, ensuring proper DNA replication and cell division (Wu2019Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, DCTD's function is vital for maintaining genomic stability by regulating the availability of dUMP, which is subsequently converted to dTMP. This process is crucial for the synthesis of dTTP, a building block of DNA, thereby supporting DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms. The enzyme's activity ensures that the nucleotide pools are balanced, preventing the accumulation of dUTP, which can lead to uracil incorporation into DNA and potential genomic instability (Wu2019Overexpression). By maintaining this balance, DCTD contributes to the fidelity of DNA replication and the overall stability of the genome.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DCTD gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In malignant glioma, a type of brain cancer, higher expression levels of DCTD are associated with poorer patient outcomes and more aggressive cancer features, such as high Ki67 expression, PTEN mutation, TP53 mutation, and EGFR amplification. Conversely, lower DCTD expression is linked to IDH1 mutations and co-deletion of 1p19q, which are indicators of a more favorable prognosis (Hu2017Gene).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), DCTD expression is implicated in resistance to gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug. The study by Wu et al. found that microRNA-620 (miR-620) downregulates DCTD, contributing to gemcitabine resistance by causing an imbalance in the dNTP pool, which affects DNA amplification. Inhibiting miR-620 or overexpressing DCTD in resistant cells can reverse this resistance, suggesting that DCTD plays a role in drug sensitivity (Wu2019Overexpression).

In pancreatic cancer, genetic variations in DCTD are associated with gemcitabine efficacy and toxicity, indicating that DCTD may influence the drug's metabolic pathway and clinical outcomes (Tanaka2010Gemcitabine).
