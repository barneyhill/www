# ANKRD6

## Overview
ANKRD6 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 6, commonly referred to as Diversin. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate its role as a molecular switch in the Wnt signaling pathways. Diversin is integral to both the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, where it regulates processes essential for cellular orientation and development. In the canonical pathway, Diversin acts as a negative regulator by promoting the degradation of β-catenin, while in the non-canonical pathway, it is involved in cellular polarization and neural tube formation. The protein's interactions with other signaling components, such as Casein kinase I epsilon (CKIε) and Vangl2, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and development (Jones2014Ankrd6; SchwarzRomond2002The). Disruptions in ANKRD6 function have been linked to developmental defects and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Allache2014Genetic; Bai2021Pancancer).

## Structure


## Function
The ANKRD6 gene encodes the protein Diversin, which plays a critical role in the Wnt signaling pathways in healthy human cells. Diversin functions as a molecular switch between the non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway, Diversin promotes processes such as convergent extension during gastrulation and neurulation, which are essential for the polarization of epithelial cells and neural tube formation (Allache2014Genetic). In the canonical Wnt pathway, Diversin acts as a negative regulator by facilitating the degradation of β-catenin. It recruits casein kinase Iε (CKIε) to the β-catenin degradation complex, promoting the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting β-catenin-dependent transcription (SchwarzRomond2002The).

ANKRD6 is also involved in regulating cellular orientation, particularly in the inner ear, where it helps maintain planar cell polarity. It is asymmetrically localized in sensory organs, contributing to the proper orientation and function of sensory hair cells (Jones2014Ankrd6). The protein's activity in these pathways is crucial for normal development, and disruptions can lead to developmental defects such as neural tube defects (Allache2014Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD6, also known as Diversin, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal and colon cancers, high expression of ANKRD6 is associated with poor prognosis, as it correlates with decreased overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (Bai2021Pancancer). This high expression is also linked to increased infiltration of M2 macrophages, suggesting a role in immune evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (Bai2021Pancancer). In contrast, low ANKRD6 expression is associated with poor prognosis in brain, breast, and lung cancers (Bai2021Pancancer).

The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration across multiple cancer types, indicating its potential role in modulating the immune microenvironment. In colon cancer, ANKRD6 expression shows significant positive correlations with immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages, which may influence tumor progression and patient outcomes (Bai2021Pancancer).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ANKRD6 as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and its involvement in the immune response, which could have implications for developing targeted therapies and immunotherapy strategies (Bai2021Pancancer).

## Interactions
ANKRD6, also known as Diversin, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathways. It interacts with Casein kinase I epsilon (CKIε) and Axin/Conductin, facilitating the recruitment of CKIε to the β-catenin degradation complex. This interaction promotes the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting β-catenin/TCF signaling (Allache2014Genetic; SchwarzRomond2002The). ANKRD6 also interacts with components of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway, such as VANGL2, PK1, and DVL3, as confirmed by yeast two-hybrid system analyses (Allache2014Genetic).

In the context of planar cell polarity (PCP), ANKRD6 interacts with Vangl2, a core PCP protein, to regulate cellular orientation in the inner ear. This interaction is crucial for the proper orientation and patterning of hair cells in the cochlea and vestibular epithelia (Jones2014Ankrd6). ANKRD6's interaction with DVL is mediated through its ankyrin repeat domains, which are essential for its role in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (Allache2014Genetic; Jones2014Ankrd6). These interactions highlight ANKRD6's function as a molecular switch between different signaling pathways.
