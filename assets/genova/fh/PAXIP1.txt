# PAXIP1

## Overview
PAXIP1, or PAX interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA repair and transcription regulation. The protein, also referred to as PTIP, is characterized by its role as a co-regulator in maintaining 3D genome architecture and facilitating promoter/enhancer interactions, particularly in response to stress hormones. It interacts with the cohesin subunit STAG2 to stabilize cohesin on chromatin, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression by the glucocorticoid receptor (MayayoPeralta2022PAXIP1). Additionally, PAXIP1 is integral to the DNA damage response, where it collaborates with proteins like 53BP1 to promote non-homologous end joining and inhibit homologous recombination, thereby maintaining genomic integrity (De2017DNA). The protein's interactions with histone methyltransferases and its involvement in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation further underscore its significance in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation (Cho2007PTIP). Alterations in PAXIP1 expression have been linked to various cancer types, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Jhuraney2016PAXIP1; De2017DNA).

## Function
PAXIP1 (PAX interacting protein 1) plays a crucial role in maintaining 3D genome architecture and facilitating promoter/enhancer contacts, which are essential for stress hormone-dependent transcription. It functions as a co-regulator with the cohesin subunit STAG2, ensuring the stability of cohesin on chromatin and its localization to glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-occupied sites. This interaction is vital for the regulation of gene expression by GR, particularly in the context of stress hormone responses (MayayoPeralta2022PAXIP1).

PAXIP1 is also involved in DNA repair processes, interacting with proteins like 53BP1 to facilitate non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and inhibit homologous recombination (HR). This function is particularly significant in maintaining genome integrity and is linked to the DNA damage response (De2017DNA). In addition, PAXIP1 is active in the nucleus, where it recruits DNA repair machinery to sites of damage and influences gene expression by modulating chromatin structure (De2017DNA).

In the context of cancer, PAXIP1 expression levels are associated with tumor prognosis, with lower levels correlating with more aggressive cancer phenotypes and worse outcomes (De2017DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAXIP1 gene have been associated with various cancer types, particularly breast and lung cancers. In breast cancer, reduced expression of PAXIP1 is linked to more aggressive tumor phenotypes and worse prognostic features, such as higher tumor grade and negative hormone receptor status. This is especially evident in HER2-like and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes, where lower PAXIP1 expression correlates with poorer outcomes (De2017DNA). Additionally, PAXIP1 expression is higher in BRCA1-mutated triple-negative breast tumors, suggesting a potential interaction with BRCA1 status and a role in DNA repair pathways (De2017DNA).

In lung cancer, PAXIP1 has been shown to enhance the effects of the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775, particularly when combined with DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin. High levels of PAXIP1 correlate with increased apoptosis and mitotic index, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target to improve treatment efficacy (Jhuraney2016PAXIP1). The interaction between PAXIP1 and WEE1 may serve as a biomarker for predicting the response to such therapies (Jhuraney2016PAXIP1).

## Interactions
PAXIP1, also known as PTIP, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of DNA damage response and transcription regulation. It interacts with the WEE1 protein through its C-terminal tandem BRCT domain, modulating WEE1's kinase activity on CDK1 (Jhuraney2016PAXIP1). PAXIP1 also forms part of a high molecular weight complex with histone methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4, along with other proteins such as ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, and hDPY-30, which are involved in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (Cho2007PTIP). 

In the DNA damage response, PAXIP1 interacts with 53BP1, a tumor suppressor protein, in an ATM-dependent manner, facilitating the phosphorylation of ATM targets and contributing to cell survival following ionizing radiation (Munoz2007Phosphoepitope). PAXIP1 is also essential for maintaining 3D genome architecture and facilitating promoter/enhancer contacts, interacting with STAG2 to regulate cohesin stability on chromatin (MayayoPeralta2022PAXIP1). These interactions highlight PAXIP1's role in both DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, influencing chromatin dynamics and gene expression.
