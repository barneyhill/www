# TOMM40L

## Overview
TOMM40L is a gene that encodes the protein translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 like, which is involved in the transport of proteins across the outer membrane of mitochondria. This protein is part of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein import, a process essential for mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. The TOMM40L protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its role in facilitating the movement of proteins across the mitochondrial membrane. Variations in the TOMM40L gene have been studied for their potential implications in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding mitochondrial-related disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
