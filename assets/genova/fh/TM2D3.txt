# TM2D3

## Overview
TM2D3 is a gene that encodes the TM2 domain containing 3 protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular processes, including the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for cell differentiation and development in mammals, and TM2D3 plays a pivotal role in the surface presentation and activation of Notch receptors, such as Notch1 and Notch2 (Masuda2023TM2D3). The protein is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues and is implicated in the phagocytosis of amyloid-β aggregates, suggesting a role in cellular clearance and maintenance (Masuda2023TM2D3). Variants of the TM2D3 gene have been associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Jakobsdottir2016Rare; Salazar2021TM2D).

## Function
The TM2D3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell differentiation and development in mammals. TM2D3 is involved in the surface presentation of Notch receptors, particularly Notch1 and Notch2, on the cell surface. This process is vital for the proper activation of Notch signaling, as it facilitates the interaction of Notch receptors with their ligands, such as JAGGED1 (Masuda2023TM2D3).

TM2D3 produces two protein variants through alternative splicing, which differ by the presence or absence of a 26-residue insert. These variants localize to small vesicular structures within the cytoplasm, with some overlap with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but not the Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of TM2D3, particularly the variant 2, enhances the production of the activated form of NOTCH1, indicating its role in activating Notch1 signaling (Masuda2023TM2D3).

The protein is also implicated in the phagocytosis of substances, including amyloid-β aggregates in macrophages, suggesting a role in cellular clearance processes. TM2D3 is expressed ubiquitously across human organs, highlighting its widespread functional significance (Masuda2023TM2D3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TM2D3 gene have been associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A rare missense variant, rs139709573 (P155L), has been linked to an increased risk and earlier onset of LOAD, particularly in the Icelandic population (Jakobsdottir2016Rare). This variant is thought to cause a loss-of-function effect in the context of Notch signaling, which is crucial for neural development (Jakobsdottir2016Rare). The P155L variant is located within the C-Type lectin domain of TM2D3, potentially disrupting protein interactions or folding, which may impair Notch signaling and contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Jakobsdottir2016Rare).

TM2D3 is also involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Salazar2021TM2D). The gene's role in phagocytosis and its interaction with amyloid-beta peptides suggest it may influence the clearance of toxic materials in the nervous system, further implicating it in neurodegenerative processes (Salazar2021TM2D). Additionally, TM2D3's involvement in Notch signaling and neuronal maintenance underscores its potential impact on age-dependent neurological conditions (Salazar2021TM2D).

## Interactions
TM2D3, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila neurogenic gene product almondex, is involved in the regulation of Notch signaling through its interactions with Notch receptors. TM2D3 physically associates with Notch1, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and this interaction is crucial for the surface presentation and activation of Notch1. The association begins before Notch1 is cleaved at the trans-Golgi network and continues post-processing. The NRR (negative regulatory region) of Notch1 is essential for its association with TM2D3, and the LNR-A region of Notch1 is crucial for this interaction. The C-terminal portion of TM2D3, including the transmembrane domains, is necessary for Notch1 activation (Masuda2023TM2D3).

TM2D3 also interacts with other proteins in the context of Alzheimer's disease. It has been implicated in the phagocytosis of amyloid-β aggregates in macrophages, and a variant of TM2D3 (P155L) is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that TM2D3 may have a role in neuronal maintenance and aging, potentially through its interactions with amyloid-β peptides (Salazar2021TM2D). These interactions highlight TM2D3's involvement in both Notch signaling and neurodegenerative processes.
