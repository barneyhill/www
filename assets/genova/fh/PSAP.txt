# PSAP

## Overview
The PSAP gene encodes the protein prosaposin, a multifunctional glycoprotein that serves as a precursor to four saposin peptides essential for lysosomal enzyme function. Prosaposin is categorized as a lysosomal protein and is involved in the degradation of glycosphingolipids, playing a critical role in cellular homeostasis. It undergoes post-translational modifications and is alternatively spliced to produce different isoforms, which are integral to its function in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and neuroprotection. Beyond its intracellular roles, prosaposin exhibits neurotrophic properties when secreted, contributing to neuronal maintenance and protection. Mutations in the PSAP gene are linked to several lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Lamarca2007Two; Hulkova2001A; Nicholson2016Prosaposin).

## Structure
The PSAP gene encodes a protein known as prosaposin, which is a precursor to four saposin domains essential for lysosomal enzyme function. The primary structure of prosaposin includes a sequence of amino acids forming these saposin domains. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are crucial for its function (Hulkova2001A).

Prosaposin is alternatively spliced to produce different isoforms, including PSAPL and PSAPS. These isoforms differ in the length of a hydrophilic loop between two transmembrane domains, with PSAPS having a shorter loop due to the removal of 17 amino acids (Lamarca2007Two). The transmembrane domains are located around amino acid positions 253-275 and 316-338, and these regions are integral to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Lamarca2007Two).

The PSAP protein contains a mitochondrial carrier domain (MCD) that overlaps with one of the transmembrane segments, although the deletion of this domain does not affect mitochondrial import or apoptotic activity, suggesting other regions may compensate for its function (Lamarca2007Two). The protein's structure allows it to interact with mitochondrial import machinery, facilitating its role in apoptosis (Xu2002The).

## Function
The PSAP gene encodes prosaposin, a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a critical role in lysosomal function and neurotrophic activities in healthy human cells. Prosaposin is a precursor protein that is cleaved into four saposin peptides (A-D), which are essential for the lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids. These saposins act as activators for lysosomal hydrolases, facilitating the hydrolysis of complex lipids, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hulkova2001A; Nicholson2016Prosaposin).

Intracellularly, prosaposin is transported to the lysosome via an LRP1-dependent mechanism or through the SORT1 receptor from the trans-Golgi network. In the lysosome, it is processed into saposins, which are vital for the breakdown of sphingolipids (Nicholson2016Prosaposin). Prosaposin also exhibits neurotrophic properties when secreted into the extracellular matrix, contributing to neuroprotection and neuronal maintenance (Hulkova2001A).

PSAP is involved in regulating progranulin (PGRN) levels, a protein with neuroprotective properties. Overexpression and knockdown of PSAP affect extracellular PGRN levels, indicating a complex regulatory role in maintaining PGRN levels, which is significant for neurodegenerative disease research (Nicholson2016Prosaposin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSAP gene, which encodes prosaposin, are associated with several lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. A novel mutation, c.803delG, in the PSAP gene leads to a complete deficiency of prosaposin and all four saposins (A, B, C, and D), resulting in a complex sphingolipidosis characterized by lactosylceramide accumulation. This condition presents with severe neurological manifestations and symptoms resembling infantile Gaucher disease, including hepatosplenomegaly and neuronal depletion (Hulkova2001A).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, mutations in the saposin D domain of the PSAP gene have been linked to both autosomal dominant inherited and sporadic forms of the disease. These mutations are associated with lysosomal dysfunction, impaired autophagic-lysosomal pathways, and a-synuclein aggregation, which are key features in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis (Oji2020Variants).

The PSAP gene also plays a role in atherosclerosis. Altered PSAP expression affects macrophage metabolism and inflammation, contributing to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. In experimental models, silencing PSAP expression in macrophages reduced plaque volume and inflammation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis (van2021Prosaposin).

## Interactions
Prosaposin (PSAP) is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function. PSAP interacts with progranulin (PGRN), a relationship that is crucial for lysosomal function and trafficking. This interaction is mediated by the granulin motifs D and E in PGRN and the BC linker region of PSAP. The binding affinity between these regions is strong, with a dissociation constant of approximately 20nM, indicating a high affinity interaction (Zhou2017The).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PSAP and PGRN colocalize extensively around amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, suggesting a significant binding relationship. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation methods, which show that PSAP consistently pulls down PGRN from brain samples (Mendsaikhan2019Characterization).

PSAP also plays a role in apoptosis through a unique mitochondrial pathway. It interacts with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and Smac/Diablo, which are essential for caspase-9 activation and subsequent apoptotic events. This pathway is independent of the Bcl-2 family proteins, highlighting a distinct mechanism of action for PSAP in apoptosis (Li2013PSAP).
