# VPS72

## Overview
VPS72 is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 72 homolog, a protein integral to chromatin remodeling and nuclear assembly processes in eukaryotic cells. The VPS72 protein, also known as YL1 or Swc2, functions primarily as a chaperone for the histone variant H2A.Z, facilitating its incorporation into chromatin. This activity is crucial for chromatin organization and the reassembly of the nucleus following mitosis. VPS72 is a component of the SRCAP and EP400 chromatin remodeling complexes, although it can also operate independently in certain contexts. The protein's role in chromatin remodeling is underscored by its involvement in the dynamic redistribution between the nucleus and mitotic cytoplasm, highlighting its importance in maintaining nuclear integrity and structure (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

## Structure
The VPS72 protein, also known as YL1 or Swc2, is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved YL-1 domain, which is essential for its function in nuclear assembly and interaction with the histone variant H2A.Z (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated). This domain is crucial for the binding and transfer of H2A.Z, a process vital for chromatin remodeling and nuclear reassembly after mitosis (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated). Truncations of VPS72 that lack the YL-1 domain or the H2A.Z binding site result in a nonfunctional protein, highlighting the importance of these regions for its activity (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

VPS72 is part of chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the EP400 and SRCAP complexes, but can also function independently of these complexes in certain contexts (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated). The protein's role as a chaperone or reader of H2A.Z suggests a specific tertiary structure that facilitates this interaction, although detailed structural information is not provided in the context. The study does not mention specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for VPS72. The protein's involvement in chromatin remodeling indicates a potential quaternary structure as part of larger protein complexes (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

## Function
VPS72, also known as YL1 or Swc2, is a crucial component in the process of nuclear reassembly after mitosis in eukaryotic cells. It functions as a chaperone for the histone variant H2A.Z, facilitating its deposition into chromatin, which is essential for forming a functional nucleus post-mitosis (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated). VPS72 is part of the SRCAP and EP400 chromatin remodeling complexes but can operate independently of these complexes during nuclear reformation (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

In healthy human cells, VPS72 is involved in chromatin de-condensation and nuclear reassembly, acting as an H2A.Z chaperone. Its downregulation extends telophase in HeLa cells, indicating its role in the timely progression through mitosis (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated). VPS72 is also essential for maintaining nuclear integrity, as its depletion leads to malformed nuclear envelopes and disorganized chromatin (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

The protein is active in the nucleus during interphase and redistributes to the mitotic cytoplasm and chromosomes during mitosis, highlighting its dynamic role in chromatin organization and nuclear structure maintenance (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
VPS72, also known as YL1, is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In melanoma, VPS72 is frequently overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor cell proliferation. Knockdown experiments of VPS72 in melanoma cell lines result in reduced cell proliferation, indicating its role in tumor development (Jostes2023H2A.Z; Jostes2024H2A.Z). Similarly, in prostate cancer (PCa), VPS72 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and high expression levels are associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. VPS72 knockdown in PCa cells decreases cell viability and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2024Prognostic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), VPS72 is overexpressed and linked to clinical stage, pathological grade, and shorter overall survival. Its expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment (Gui2023Bioinformatics). Additionally, genetic studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism near VPS72 that is associated with a delayed onset of the disease, although it does not affect the risk of developing ALS itself (Zhang2021Combined).

## Interactions
VPS72, also known as YL1, is a component of chromatin remodeling complexes, including the SRCAP and EP400 complexes. It plays a crucial role in the incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z into chromatin, which is essential for proper nuclear assembly and chromatin organization. VPS72 acts as a chaperone for H2A.Z, facilitating its deposition into nucleosomes, a process vital for nuclear reassembly after mitosis (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

VPS72 interacts with other proteins such as pontin and reptin, which are also part of chromatin remodeling complexes. These interactions are important for chromatin de-condensation during mitotic exit (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated). Despite being a part of the SRCAP and EP400 complexes, VPS72 can function independently of these complexes in nuclear reassembly, as its role does not require the SRCAP ATPase (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).

In addition to its role in chromatin remodeling, VPS72 is involved in the regulation of gene transcription through its interactions with histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. Its interaction with H2A.Z is particularly critical, as mutations that disrupt this binding prevent VPS72 from fulfilling its function in nuclear assembly (MorenoAndrés2020VPS72YL1Mediated).
