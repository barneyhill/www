# PRKG1

## Overview
The PRKG1 gene encodes protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (cGKI), a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is integral to numerous physiological processes. This kinase is activated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and is involved in mediating smooth muscle relaxation, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and facilitating neuronal signaling (Hofmann2013cGMPDependent). PRKG1 is expressed in various tissues, including the cardiovascular system, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure through the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway (Zeng2014MiR‐20a). Additionally, PRKG1 is implicated in bone formation, renal sodium handling, and the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms (Jafari2015Pharmacological; Langmesser2009cGMPDependent). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as MYPT1 and IRAG, underscore its importance in modulating key signaling pathways (Roy2024Integrative). Mutations in PRKG1 have been linked to various pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2018Exome; Benvenuto2020Expression).

## Structure
The PRKG1 gene encodes the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, which exists in multiple isoforms, primarily PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, resulting from alternative splicing. These isoforms differ in their N-terminal regions, which influence their dimerization and autoinhibitory domains (Casteel2010A). The N-terminal region of PKG, approximately 50 amino acids long, is crucial for homodimerization and interaction with isoform-specific PKG-anchoring proteins (GKAPs) (Casteel2010A).

The PKG Iβ isoform features a unique leucine/isoleucine zipper that mediates dimerization through specific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, forming a double-stranded parallel coiled-coil structure (Casteel2010A). This structure is essential for the protein's stability and specificity, with interhelical salt bridges contributing to its stability (Casteel2010A).

PKG Iα contains a leucine zipper (LZ) domain, stabilized by a C42-C42' disulfide bond, which is crucial for dimer stability and cellular targeting (Qin2015Structures). The LZ domain forms parallel coiled-coil dimers, with leucine or isoleucine residues forming a hydrophobic core (Qin2015Structures).

The catalytic activity of PKG Iα is regulated by phosphorylation, with T517 identified as a critical phosphorylation site necessary for activation (Moon2018An). The monomeric form of PKG Iα, lacking the N-terminal residues 1-53, is autoinhibited and serves as a model for understanding the activation mechanism (Moon2018An).

## Function
The PRKG1 gene encodes cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (cGKI), a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by mediating the effects of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In healthy human cells, PRKG1 is involved in smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation inhibition, and neuronal signaling. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane (Zeng2014MiR‐20a; Hofmann2013cGMPDependent).

In the cardiovascular system, PRKG1 is essential for regulating vascular tone and blood pressure. It mediates the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells through the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway, maintaining a contractile, differentiated phenotype and preventing excessive proliferation of these cells (Zeng2014MiR‐20a; Weber2007Rescue). PRKG1 also plays a significant role in renal sodium handling, contributing to the homeostatic control mechanism known as pressure-natriuresis, which helps regulate blood pressure by promoting diuresis and natriuresis (Citterio2013cGMPDependent).

Beyond the cardiovascular system, PRKG1 is involved in bone formation, where it acts as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Inhibition of PRKG1 can enhance bone formation by activating the RhoA-Akt signaling pathway (Jafari2015Pharmacological). Additionally, PRKG1 is implicated in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms, affecting the timing and quality of sleep and wakefulness (Langmesser2009cGMPDependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRKG1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, mutations in PRKG1 are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD), a condition with high mortality often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A specific de novo mutation, c.1108 G > A (p.Gly370Ser), was identified in a patient with aortic dissection, predicted to disrupt protein function and classified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines (Zhang2018Exome).

In hypertension, PRKG1 polymorphisms affect renal sodium handling, contributing to a salt-sensitive phenotype and impaired sodium reabsorption, which can lead to hypertension. These polymorphisms influence the interaction between PRKG1, Src, and α1 Na-K ATPase, affecting blood pressure regulation (Citterio2013cGMPDependent).

In cancer, PRKG1 expression levels have been linked to bladder cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer. In bladder cancer, lower PRKG1 expression is associated with higher tumor grade, muscle invasion, and poor survival outcomes, suggesting an anti-tumor role for PRKG1 (Jin2024The). In ovarian cancer, high PRKG1 expression is associated with a lower probability of survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Benvenuto2020Expression).

## Interactions
PRKG1, or protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with MYPT1, a regulatory subunit of myosin phosphatase, which plays a crucial role in smooth muscle contraction by dephosphorylating myosin light chains. This interaction is significant for the regulation of muscle tone and vascular function (Roy2024Integrative).

PRKG1 also interacts with IRAG (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-associated cGMP kinase substrate), which influences calcium release from intracellular stores. This interaction is important for modulating calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release (Roy2024Integrative).

Additionally, PRKG1 interacts with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is involved in the breakdown of cyclic GMP. This interaction helps regulate cyclic GMP levels within cells, impacting processes such as vasodilation and platelet aggregation (Roy2024Integrative).

These interactions highlight the role of PRKG1 in modulating key signaling pathways through its ability to form complexes with other proteins, thereby influencing various physiological processes.
