# ZNF98

## Overview
ZNF98 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 98, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 98 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression patterns, contributing to genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. The gene's involvement in critical cellular functions underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular operations and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders (Lian2020The; Shpak2014An; Akhmerova2023Genetic).

## Function
ZNF98, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. ZNF98 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. This regulation is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and ensuring the correct expression of genes necessary for cell growth and development.

ZNF98 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. By altering chromatin configuration, ZNF98 can either promote or inhibit the transcription of specific genes, thus playing a significant role in controlling the cellular environment and response to various signals. Its activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating the appropriate transcriptional responses required for normal cellular operations. Through these molecular processes, ZNF98 contributes to the overall homeostasis and functionality of cells, impacting organismal development and health.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF98, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and genetic associations. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), ZNF98 is part of a co-expression network that is significantly downregulated, particularly in the metastasis phase of LUAD. This downregulation is suggested to play a crucial role in the progression of these cancers, indicating that ZNF98 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Lian2020The).

In glioblastoma multiforme, ZNF98 is associated with multiple expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), suggesting its involvement in the genetic regulation of expression in this type of brain cancer (Shpak2014An). Additionally, ZNF98 is upregulated in glioma-related seizures, indicating a potential role in the pathology of these seizures (Feyissa2021Analysis).

ZNF98 has also been identified as a genetic modifier in thoracic aortic aneurysm severity, although it is not a direct cause of the condition (Landis2017Exome). In the context of bronchial asthma, ZNF98 is part of a cluster of transcription factors associated with the disease's pathogenesis (Akhmerova2023Genetic).
