# EML6

## Overview
EML6, or Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein-Like 6, is a gene that encodes the protein EMAP like 6, which is part of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular transport. The EML6 protein is characterized by its ability to bind to microtubules, influencing their stability and organization. Mutations or dysregulation of the EML6 gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
