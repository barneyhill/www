# EBPL

## Overview
The EBPL gene encodes the emopamil-binding protein-like (EBPL) protein, which is a transmembrane protein located on human chromosome 13q14.2. Although structurally similar to the emopamil-binding protein (EBP), EBPL lacks the sterol δ8-δ7 isomerase activity that characterizes EBP and does not bind sigma ligands with high affinity. The protein is predominantly expressed in the liver, lung, and kidney and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes related to this organelle (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). Despite its structural similarities to EBP, EBPL forms homodimers and exhibits weak interactions with EBP, indicating a distinct functional pathway (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The specific physiological role of EBPL remains unidentified, although it is known to interact with DNA sequences such as the SV40 enhancer, suggesting a potential involvement in transcriptional regulation (Clark1988Identification). Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise functions and clinical significance of EBPL in human health and disease.

## Structure
The emopamil-binding protein-like (EBPL) protein is encoded by the EBPL gene located on human chromosome 13q14.2. The protein consists of 204 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 23.2 kDa (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). EBPL shares 31% identity and 52% similarity with the emopamil-binding protein (EBP) over 172 amino acid residues, particularly in the transmembrane segments 2-4, but lacks similarity at the N- and C-termini (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The hydropathy profile of EBPL, analyzed using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm, predicts four putative transmembrane segments, similar to EBP (MOEBIUS2003Cloning).

EBPL does not exhibit sterol δ8-δ7 isomerase activity, a function present in EBP, and does not bind sigma ligands with high affinity (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The protein predominantly forms homodimers and shows weak association with EBP, indicating limited quaternary interactions between the two proteins (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The C-terminus of EBPL encodes a putative sequence for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, although this motif is less pronounced compared to EBP (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The protein's expression is not regulated by cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition (MOEBIUS2003Cloning).

## Function
The EBPL gene encodes a protein similar to the emopamil-binding protein (EBP), but it lacks the sterol δ8-δ7 isomerase activity characteristic of EBP. Despite its structural similarity to EBP, EBPL does not participate in cholesterol biosynthesis and does not bind sigma ligands with high affinity, indicating it does not form the sigma 2-ligand-binding site (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). EBPL is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression levels in the liver, lung, and kidney (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, similar to EBP, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes related to this organelle (MOEBIUS2003Cloning).

EBPL forms homodimers and associates weakly with EBP, indicating a distinct functional pathway (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). The expression of EBPL is not regulated by cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors, suggesting it may have a unique function unrelated to sterol metabolism (MOEBIUS2003Cloning). Despite extensive research, the specific physiological role of EBPL in human cells remains unidentified, and its function in cellular and organismal processes is yet to be discovered (MOEBIUS2003Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the EBPL gene can significantly impact lipid metabolism, leading to various health conditions. EBPL encodes a protein similar to emopamil-binding protein (EBP), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. Disruptions in this process can result in disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a condition characterized by impaired steroidogenesis due to disrupted cholesterol homeostasis (EBPL). This disruption can lead to an imbalance in hormone production, affecting growth and development.

Additionally, alterations in EBPL expression or function have been associated with certain types of cancer. The gene's involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to the abnormal lipid metabolism observed in cancer cells, potentially influencing tumor growth and progression (EBPL). The precise mechanisms by which EBPL mutations or expression changes contribute to these diseases are still under investigation, but the gene's role in maintaining cholesterol balance is a critical factor in understanding its clinical significance. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of conditions associated with EBPL and to develop targeted therapies for affected individuals.

## Interactions
EBPL, or emopamil-binding protein-like, is known to interact with the SV40 enhancer, a DNA sequence involved in transcriptional regulation. EBPL specifically binds to the GT-I region of the SV40 enhancer, as demonstrated by DNase I protection experiments, which show that EBPL protects specific regions from cleavage, indicating its binding sites (Clark1988Identification). The binding of EBPL to the SV40 enhancer is sequence-specific, with certain mutations in the enhancer significantly reducing its binding affinity, while others do not affect it (Clark1988Identification). EBPL's binding site overlaps with those of other proteins, such as AP-2 and AP-3, but it can be distinguished from these proteins based on its binding to mutated templates. The binding of EBPL may exclude the binding of AP-2 and AP-3, or vice versa (Clark1988Identification).

EBPL also interacts with synthetic oligonucleotides containing NF-kB and H2TFI-binding sites, competing for binding with similar efficiency to the SV1 oligonucleotide (Clark1988Identification). Despite its interactions with DNA, EBPL does not form strong interactions with the emopamil-binding protein (EBP), as it predominantly forms homodimers rather than heterodimers with EBP (MOEBIUS2003Cloning).
