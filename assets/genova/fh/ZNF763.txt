# ZNF763

## Overview
ZNF763 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 763, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA and other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression. ZNF763 is implicated in various biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, particularly in neural cells. It has been identified as hypomethylated and highly expressed in glial cells of the adult cerebral cortex, suggesting a role in brain development and function, especially in the context of Down syndrome (Laan2020DNA). Additionally, ZNF763 is involved in protein-protein interactions, notably with TP53, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Ahmed2021Protein).

## Interactions
ZNF763 is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly noted for its interaction with TP53, a gene that plays a significant role in various cancers and other diseases. This interaction suggests that ZNF763 may be part of a broader network of genes involved in disease processes, including stomach cancer (Ahmed2021Protein). The study by Ahmed et al. highlights the importance of these interactions in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and their potential implications for drug design.

In the context of Down syndrome, ZNF763 is part of a cluster of zinc finger proteins that exhibit differential methylation patterns. These patterns are associated with transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure, indicating that ZNF763 may interact with DNA and other proteins to influence gene expression in neural cells. The study by Laan et al. identifies ZNF763 as hypomethylated and highly expressed in glial cells of the adult cerebral cortex, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and possibly in the formation of multiprotein complexes that affect brain development in Down syndrome (Laan2020DNA). However, specific protein interactions of ZNF763 in this context are not detailed.
