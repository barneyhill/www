# AGPAT5

## Overview
AGPAT5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 5, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid from lysophosphatidic acid, a key step in the formation of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol, essential components of cellular membranes and energy storage molecules (Prasad2011Enzymatic). AGPAT5 is predominantly localized in the mitochondria and microsomes, indicating its significant role in mitochondrial lipid metabolism and membrane integrity (Prasad2011Enzymatic). The enzyme's activity is particularly notable in the context of neuronal function, where it is involved in glucose sensing and energy homeostasis (Strembitska2022Lipid). Additionally, AGPAT5 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as potential prognostic markers in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (Wen2023The; Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

## Function
AGPAT5 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 5) is an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid (PA). This reaction is crucial for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol (TAG), which are essential components of cellular membranes and energy storage molecules (Prasad2011Enzymatic). AGPAT5 is localized to the mitochondria and microsomes, suggesting a role in mitochondrial lipid metabolism and the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane integrity (Prasad2011Enzymatic).

In healthy human cells, AGPAT5 shows significant acyltransferase activity, particularly towards lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) in the presence of C18:1 fatty acid, indicating a preference for certain lysophospholipids as acyl acceptors (Prasad2011Enzymatic). The enzyme's activity is enriched in the mitochondrial fraction, implying a specific function in mitochondrial lipid synthesis or remodeling (Prasad2011Enzymatic). AGPAT5's role in lipid metabolism is also linked to its function in AgRP neurons, where it is crucial for hypoglycemia sensing and glucagon secretion, ensuring that neuronal activity corresponds to glucose levels rather than circulating free fatty acids (Strembitska2022Lipid).

## Clinical Significance
AGPAT5 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression levels of AGPAT5 are associated with shorter overall survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression is significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression correlates with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wen2023The). The study also found that AGPAT5 expression is linked to homologous recombination deficiency and a poor immunotherapeutic response, suggesting its involvement in the tumor immune microenvironment (Wen2023The).

In colorectal cancer, AGPAT5 expression is reduced, and higher levels are associated with a more favorable prognosis, suggesting an anticancer characteristic in this context (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). The gene's activity is also noted to decrease sensitivity to ferroptosis, a form of cell death, which may influence cancer cell survival (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

AGPAT5's role in lipid metabolism and its localization to mitochondria suggest its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis, although specific diseases directly linked to AGPAT5 mutations are not well-documented (Prasad2011Enzymatic).
