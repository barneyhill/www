# TMPRSS5

## Overview
TMPRSS5 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 5, also known as spinesin. This protein is categorized as a type II transmembrane serine protease, characterized by its enzymatic activity facilitated by a serine protease domain. TMPRSS5 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neuronal cells, axons, and synapses, suggesting its involvement in synaptic function and neuronal communication (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5). The protein is also expressed in Schwann cells and inner ear tissues, indicating a potential role in myelination and auditory function (Wang2019Transmembrane; Guipponi2007An). TMPRSS5 has been implicated as a potential biomarker for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, although its precise role in disease pathology and other physiological processes remains to be fully elucidated (Wang2019Transmembrane; Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

## Structure
The TMPRSS5 protein, also known as spinesin, is a type II transmembrane serine protease encoded by the TMPRSS5 gene located on chromosome 11q23. The protein consists of 457 amino acids and is characterized by a type II transmembrane structure, which includes a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a stem region with a scavenger receptor-like domain, and a serine protease domain (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5).

The transmembrane region spans from Ala 50 to Leu 72, and the serine protease domain is located in the C-terminal half of the molecule, from Ile 218 to Leu 457. This domain contains the essential catalytic triad of His, Asp, and Ser, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5). The protein shares significant sequence similarity with other members of the TMPRSS family, such as TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS3, with sequence identities of 45.5% and 39.1%, respectively (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5).

Spinesin is glycosylated at five N-glycosylation sites in its extracellular region, which may influence its stability and function (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5). The protein is synthesized as a single-chain zymogen and activated by cleavage at a conserved site, with the catalytic domain linked to the stem region by a disulfide bond (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5; Yamaguchi2007cAMP‐dependent).

## Function
TMPRSS5, also known as spinesin, is a type II transmembrane serine protease predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain and spinal cord. It is specifically localized in neuronal cells, axons, and synapses, suggesting a role in synaptic function and neuronal communication (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5). The protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a serine protease domain located in the C-terminal half, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5).

TMPRSS5 is involved in proteolytic processing, similar to trypsin, kallikrein, and plasminogen activator, indicating its role in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5). It is activated by cleavage at a conserved site, which is crucial for its enzymatic function. The protein is also expressed in Schwann cells, where it is regulated by the transcription factor Sox10, suggesting its involvement in Schwann cell-specific functions and myelination processes (Wang2019Transmembrane).

In the context of hearing, TMPRSS5 is expressed in inner ear tissues and has been implicated in auditory function, although its precise role in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated (Guipponi2007An). The protein's localization at the plasma membrane suggests it may participate in cell signaling or interaction with the extracellular environment (Guipponi2007An).

## Clinical Significance
TMPRSS5, also known as spinesin, has been identified as a potential biomarker for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), a genetic neuromuscular disorder. In CMT1A patients, TMPRSS5 is significantly elevated compared to controls, suggesting its specificity to this subtype of the disease. However, its levels do not correlate with disease severity or progression, indicating limited clinical significance in terms of monitoring disease advancement (Wang2019Transmembrane). 

The expression of TMPRSS5 is regulated by the transcription factor Sox10 and is predominantly found in Schwann cells, which are affected in CMT1A. Despite its elevation in CMT1A, TMPRSS5 is not significantly elevated in other forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its potential specificity to CMT1A (Wang2019Transmembrane). 

While TMPRSS5 has been studied in the context of CMT1A, its role in other diseases, particularly those affecting the auditory system, remains to be fully elucidated. The gene's expression in the central nervous system and its potential involvement in the auditory system suggest that alterations in TMPRSS5 could contribute to hearing impairments, although specific clinical implications are not yet well-defined (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored; Yamaguchi2002SpinesinTMPRSS5).
