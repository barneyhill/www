# OR10G7

## Overview
OR10G7 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily G member 7, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR10G7 is predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium but is also found in non-chemosensory tissues, such as the skin, where it may participate in inflammatory responses. The gene has been suggested to undergo balancing selection, particularly in certain populations, which may enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites (Tong2021Ectopic; Alonso2008Overdominance). Despite its involvement in various biological processes, the clinical significance of OR10G7 remains to be fully elucidated, with ongoing research needed to clarify its potential roles in health and disease (Kang2021UVIrradiation; An2014NCG).

## Function
OR10G7 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR10G7 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Tong2021Ectopic).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR10G7 is also expressed in non-chemosensory tissues, such as the skin. In keratinocytes, OR10G7 is implicated in the inflammatory response associated with atopic dermatitis. Activation of OR10G7 by its ligand, eugenol, increases the mRNA expression of interleukin-1β and activates the Adcy-cAMP signaling pathway, suggesting a role in skin inflammation (Tong2021Ectopic).

Additionally, OR10G7 may have evolved under balancing selection, particularly in the African YRI population, where its genetic diversity is maintained. This diversity could enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the number of different odorant-binding sites, allowing for better discrimination among structurally related odorants (Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR10G7 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions resulting from its mutations. However, it is often included in lists of candidate cancer genes due to its tendency to mutate, although its biological function and expression patterns suggest it does not play a functional role in cancer (An2014NCG). In the context of cancer, OR10G7 has been identified as having a low relative standard deviation in gene expression across multiple cancer types, indicating stable expression patterns rather than specific clinical implications (Sehovic2019Detection).

In skin-related conditions, OR10G7 is expressed in human keratinocytes and may be linked to skin barrier dysfunctions, such as those induced by UV irradiation and inflammation. This suggests a potential role in skin conditions like atopic dermatitis and wound healing, although further research is needed to fully understand its involvement (Kang2021UVIrradiation).

Overall, while OR10G7 is implicated in various biological contexts, its direct clinical significance remains unclear, necessitating further investigation to elucidate its role in disease processes.
