# TAF11L2

## Overview
TAF11L2 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 2, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene expression. TAF11L2 is part of a larger family of TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) that interact with the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) to facilitate the transcription of genes by RNA polymerase II. The precise function and interactions of TAF11L2 within the transcription machinery are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression and its impact on cellular processes.
