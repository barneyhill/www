# VWF

## Overview
The VWF gene encodes the von Willebrand factor, a crucial multimeric glycoprotein involved in hemostasis. This gene is located on chromosome 12 and spans approximately 178 kilobases, comprising 52 exons that encode a 2813-amino acid precursor protein (Mancuso1989Structure). The von Willebrand factor plays a pivotal role in blood clotting by mediating platelet adhesion to sites of vascular injury and serving as a carrier for factor VIII, a key clotting protein (Wagner1990Cell; Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). The protein is synthesized primarily in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, stored in specialized cellular compartments, and released into the bloodstream upon vascular injury (Denis2002Molecular; Lenting2015von). Its function is regulated by shear stress, which enhances its ability to mediate platelet interactions, particularly under high shear conditions (Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). Mutations in the VWF gene can lead to von Willebrand disease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder, characterized by varying degrees of bleeding tendency depending on the type and severity of the mutation (James2011von; Franchini2007The).

## Structure
The von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein essential for hemostasis. Its primary structure includes a polypeptide moiety with a molecular weight of approximately 225,843, which increases to about 278,000 when carbohydrates are included. The protein contains 11 asparagine-linked glycosylation sites and likely ten O-linked glycosylation sites, contributing to its 18.7% carbohydrate content (Titani1986Amino). The VWF gene spans approximately 178 kilobases and includes 52 exons, encoding a 2813-amino acid precursor that includes a 22-amino acid signal peptide, a 741-amino acid propeptide, and a 2050-amino acid mature subunit (Mancuso1989Structure).

The secondary structure of VWF features β-sheets and α-helices, stabilized by numerous disulfide bonds. These bonds are crucial for the protein's multivalent role, including binding to collagen, factor VIII, and platelets (Titani1986Amino). The tertiary structure involves extensive disulfide bridges, particularly in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions, forming a network of cross-links (Marti1987Identification).

In its quaternary structure, VWF exists as multimers formed by disulfide-linked subunits, with molecular weights ranging from 0.5 to 12 million (Fowler1985Substructure). These multimers are composed of repeating protomer units, each consisting of two 240,000-mol wt subunits linked by disulfide bonds (Fowler1985Substructure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and sulfation, which are essential for its function and stability (Titani1986Amino).

## Function
The von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein essential for hemostasis, primarily facilitating platelet adhesion to sites of vascular injury. It achieves this by binding to specific platelet membrane glycoproteins and exposed connective tissue components, such as collagen, at the site of injury (Wagner1990Cell; Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). VWF also serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII, a critical blood-clotting protein, stabilizing it in circulation and protecting it from proteolytic degradation (Wagner1990Cell; Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY).

In healthy human cells, VWF is synthesized in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, stored in Weibel-Palade bodies within endothelial cells, and α-granules in platelets (Denis2002Molecular; Lenting2015von). Upon vascular injury, VWF is secreted into the bloodstream, where it circulates in a multimeric form, with the largest multimers being most effective in mediating platelet interactions (Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY; Wagner1990Cell). The protein's activity is regulated by shear stress in blood flow, which enhances its reactivity and ability to mediate platelet adhesion, particularly under high shear conditions (Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). This function is crucial for the formation of a stable blood clot and maintaining vascular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VWF gene lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder. VWD is categorized into several types based on the nature of the mutation and its effect on the von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein. Type 1 VWD, the most common form, is often caused by missense mutations that reduce VWF plasma levels, resulting in mild mucocutaneous bleeding (James2011von; Franchini2007The). Type 2 VWD is divided into subtypes 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N, each with distinct functional defects. Type 2A involves impaired multimer assembly, while type 2B is characterized by increased affinity of mutant VWF for platelets, leading to spontaneous binding and clearance of large VWF multimers (James2011von; Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). Type 2M involves impaired platelet adhesion, and type 2N is marked by low factor VIII levels, mimicking hemophilia A (Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). Type 3 VWD, the most severe form, results from mutations that prevent VWF secretion, leading to severe bleeding symptoms from birth (James2011von; Sadler1998BIOCHEMISTRY). Elevated VWF levels are associated with thrombotic conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction (Mufti2018The).

## Interactions
Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a critical role in hemostasis through its interactions with various proteins. VWF binds to procoagulant factor VIII, stabilizing it and extending its half-life in circulation. This interaction occurs at the N-terminal 272 residues of VWF, with a high binding affinity characterized by fast association and dissociation rates (Shiltagh2014Solution).

VWF also interacts with platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), a key interaction for platelet adhesion under high shear stress conditions. The A1 domain of VWF, specifically residues 1323-1395, is responsible for binding GPIbα, facilitating platelet tethering and activation (Shiltagh2014Solution; Ruggeri2003Von). This interaction is crucial for initiating platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury (Savage1996Initiation).

The A3 domain of VWF binds to fibrillar collagens I and III, which is essential for immobilizing VWF on exposed subendothelial structures during vascular injury (Shiltagh2014Solution; Ruggeri2003Von). VWF also interacts with the platelet integrin receptor αIIbβ3 through an RGD motif in the VWC4 domain, contributing to platelet aggregation (Shiltagh2014Solution).

ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease, cleaves VWF at a specific site within the A2 domain, regulating VWF multimer size and preventing excessive thrombus formation (Shiltagh2014Solution; Ruggeri2003Von). These interactions highlight VWF's central role in maintaining hemostatic balance.
