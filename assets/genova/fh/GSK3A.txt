# GSK3A

## Overview
GSK3A is a gene that encodes the protein glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha, a serine/threonine kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes. This kinase is part of the CMGC kinase group and plays a crucial role in regulating glycogen metabolism, Wnt signaling, and insulin signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by a highly conserved structure, particularly in regions essential for ATP binding and substrate interaction, and is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. GSK3A is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its interactions with various proteins, including those involved in sperm motility and cellular signaling networks, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Clinically, GSK3A has been implicated in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Banerji2012The; Jope2004The; Darrington2012Distinct; Frame2001A; Beurel2015Glycogen).

## Structure
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3A) is a serine/threonine kinase with a highly conserved primary structure across species, particularly in regions involved in ATP binding and substrate interaction (OSOLODKIN2011Bioinformatic). The secondary structure of GSK3A likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of kinase domains, although specific details are not provided (OSOLODKIN2011Bioinformatic). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these secondary elements into a functional kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (OSOLODKIN2011Bioinformatic).

GSK3A contains a large glycine-rich N-terminal region, which is absent in its paralog GSK3β (Beurel2015Glycogen). This region may influence the protein's regulatory mechanisms and interactions. The kinase domain of GSK3A is similar to that of GSK3β, with both isoforms sharing 97% sequence identity within their catalytic domains (Sarikhani2018SIRT2).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation at Lys246, play a significant role in regulating GSK3A's activity. This modification hinders adenosine binding and affects the stability of interactions with negatively charged phosphates, which can be reversed by SIRT2-mediated deacetylation (Sarikhani2018SIRT2). The quaternary structure of GSK3A is not detailed, suggesting it may function as a monomer or in complex with other proteins (OSOLODKIN2011Bioinformatic).

## Function
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3A) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, where it phosphorylates glycogen synthase, thereby inhibiting its activity and controlling glycogen synthesis (Frame2001A). GSK3A is also a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its degradation and thus regulating gene expression and cell proliferation (Jope2004The).

GSK3A is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, influencing cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Hermida2017GSK3). In the nucleus, GSK3A regulates transcription factors, impacting gene expression and signaling pathways (Jope2004The). It also interacts with various receptors, including insulin receptor substrates, linking it to insulin signaling pathways and affecting glucose metabolism (Beurel2015Glycogen).

The kinase's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, with inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser21 reducing its activity, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling networks (Hermida2017GSK3). GSK3A's involvement in these molecular processes is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
GSK3A (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha) has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in various cellular processes. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GSK3A is identified as a potential therapeutic target. Loss of GSK3A in AML cell lines induces differentiation, decreases cell growth and proliferation, and induces apoptosis, suggesting its critical role in AML pathogenesis (Banerji2012The). Inhibition of GSK3A has been shown to impair disease progression and improve survival in AML models, indicating that isoform-specific inhibition could be a viable treatment strategy (Banerji2012The).

In prostate cancer, GSK3A is predominantly upregulated in tumors with a low Gleason score and is associated with androgen-dependent proliferation by activating the androgen receptor (Darrington2012Distinct). This suggests that GSK3A may play a role in the early stages of prostate cancer progression.

GSK3A is also involved in the progression of hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML. Its deletion leads to metabolic changes that, when combined with GSK3B deletion, can induce AML (Guezguez2016GSK3). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GSK3A in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GSK3A, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In human sperm, GSK3A primarily localizes to the flagellum and head, where it interacts with a variety of proteins, many of which are novel and potentially involved in sperm motility (Freitas2019Isoformspecific). The study by Freitas et al. identified 46 putative interactors for GSK3A, with 76% being novel interactors. Of these, 58.7% contained the GSK3 consensus phosphorylation site, and 34.8% were previously described in testis or sperm (Freitas2019Isoformspecific). 

GSK3A also forms part of a broader network of interactions within the CMGC kinase group. It shares many high-confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs) with GSK3B, such as GSKIP, FRAT1, PPP1R2, AXIN1, AXIN2, and PRKACA, although GSK3B uniquely interacts with β-catenin and APC, indicating distinct roles in Wnt signaling (Varjosalo2013The). 

In the context of sperm motility, specific interactors like PRSS37, DRC1, RPS19, HSPA5, and AP3D1 are associated with motility-related functions. PRSS37, in particular, is highly expressed in the testis and is linked to sperm motility (Freitas2019Isoformspecific). These interactions highlight GSK3A's role in regulating cellular processes through its diverse protein interactions.
