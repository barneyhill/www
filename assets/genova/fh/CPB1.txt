# CPB1

## Overview
The CPB1 gene encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase B1, a metalloenzyme that plays a critical role in the final stages of protein digestion. This enzyme is primarily active in the pancreas, where it removes C-terminal lysine or arginine residues from peptides, facilitating efficient protein breakdown. Carboxypeptidase B1 is secreted as an inactive proenzyme and becomes activated in the small intestine. Beyond its digestive functions, CPB1 is involved in pancreatic regeneration, particularly influencing β-cell proliferation through its phosphorylation state (Yu2017Phosphorylation). The gene has clinical significance, with mutations linked to increased risks of pancreatic and breast cancers, and its expression levels serving as potential prognostic markers in breast cancer (Bouchal2015185; Kawamoto2021Endoplasmic; Kothari2021Is).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1) is an enzyme primarily involved in the final stages of protein digestion. It functions as a metalloenzyme, which means it requires a metal ion to catalyze its reactions. CPB1 specifically removes C-terminal lysine or arginine residues from peptides, a crucial step in protein digestion that occurs in the pancreas. The enzyme is secreted as an inactive proenzyme and becomes activated in the small intestine, where it performs its digestive functions.

In the context of pancreatic regeneration, CPB1 has been implicated in the regulation of β-cell proliferation. Research indicates that the phosphorylation state of CPB1, particularly at tyrosine residues, is crucial for its function in cell proliferation. After partial pancreatectomy, a reduction in CPB1 phosphorylation correlates with increased β-cell proliferation, suggesting that dephosphorylation of CPB1 may promote pancreatic cell survival and regeneration (Yu2017Phosphorylation).

While CPB1's primary role is in digestion, its involvement in pancreatic regeneration highlights its potential significance in cellular processes beyond digestion, particularly in the context of tissue repair and regeneration. However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells outside of these contexts are not extensively documented in the provided sources.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CPB1 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. In pancreatic cancer, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing variants in CPB1 have been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These variants are significantly more common in pancreatic cancer patients compared to controls, with an odds ratio of 7.25, indicating a strong association (Kawamoto2021Endoplasmic).

In breast cancer, CPB1 expression levels have been studied as potential prognostic markers. Higher CPB1 expression is observed in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared to normal tissue and other lesions, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). This suggests that CPB1 may help distinguish DCIS from other conditions and could be associated with better survival outcomes (Kothari2021Is). Additionally, CPB1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for metastasis in low-grade breast cancer, with increased expression in lymph node-positive grade 1 tumors (Bouchal2015185).

However, CPB1 variants have not been associated with chronic pancreatitis, as studies found no significant differences in variant frequencies between patients and controls (Nakano2015Variants).
