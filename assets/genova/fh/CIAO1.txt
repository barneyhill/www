# CIAO1

## Overview
The CIAO1 gene encodes the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 1, a protein integral to the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly machinery. This protein is categorized within the WD40 protein family, characterized by its seven-bladed beta propeller structure, which facilitates diverse protein-protein interactions (Johnstone1998Ciao; Srinivasan2007Structure). CIAO1 plays a crucial role in the maturation and stabilization of Fe-S proteins, which are essential for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and ribosome biogenesis (Kim2018Cytosolic; Maio2024CIAO1). The protein operates within a multiprotein complex, interacting with other components such as MMS19 and FAM96B, to ensure the proper incorporation of Fe-S clusters into target proteins, thereby maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and genome stability (Kim2018Cytosolic; Maio2024CIAO1). Additionally, CIAO1's interactions extend to modulating transcriptional activities, notably influencing the tumor suppressor protein WT1 (Johnstone1998Ciao).

## Structure
CIAO1 is a protein characterized by a seven-bladed beta propeller structure, a hallmark of the WD40 protein family. This structure is formed by seven WD40 repeats, which are beta-sheet-rich domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Johnstone1998Ciao; Srinivasan2007Structure). The beta propeller fold of CIAO1 is arranged around a central axis, creating a doughnut-shaped geometry that serves as a docking site for various cellular networks (CiofiBaffoni2018Protein).

The primary structure of CIAO1 consists of 339 amino acids, and it includes a crucial LYR motif (Leu-Tyr-Arg) that is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as HSC20, which is involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (Johnstone1998Ciao; Kim2018Cytosolic). The tertiary structure of CIAO1 is highly conserved, with a well-preserved arrangement of the beta propeller blades, particularly in the core regions (Srinivasan2007Structure).

CIAO1 forms part of the CIA targeting complex, interacting with proteins like MMS19 and CIA2B, which are involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear [4Fe-4S] target proteins (CiofiBaffoni2018Protein). The protein can also form heterotrimeric complexes with CIA2A, which are crucial for the maturation of aconitase, a key enzyme in cellular metabolism (Maione2018Investigating).

## Function
The CIAO1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly (CIA) machinery. This machinery is essential for the biogenesis and maturation of Fe-S proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and ribosome biogenesis (Kim2018Cytosolic; Maio2024CIAO1). CIAO1 operates downstream of the core Fe-S cluster assembly system and is involved in recruiting Fe-S recipient proteins, facilitating the transfer of Fe-S clusters to these proteins, which are necessary for their proper function (Maio2024CIAO1).

In healthy human cells, CIAO1 interacts with other components of the CIA complex, such as MMS19 and FAM96B, to stabilize and facilitate the incorporation of Fe-S clusters into recipient proteins (Maio2024CIAO1). This process is vital for maintaining genome stability and cellular iron homeostasis. CIAO1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in modulating the transcriptional activity of certain proteins, such as the tumor suppressor protein WT1, by interacting with it and potentially influencing cellular processes controlled by WT1 (Johnstone1998Ciao).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CIAO1 gene are linked to a specific neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and learning disabilities. This disorder is associated with compromised nucleocytoplasmic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) enzymes, which are crucial for various cellular processes. Patients with biallelic variants in CIAO1 exhibit symptoms such as calf hypertrophy, Achilles tendon contractures, joint hyperlaxity, proximal and axial muscle weakness, and facial weakness. Respiratory weakness is also common, with forced vital capacity (FVC) percentages ranging from 51% to 65% (Maio2024CIAO1).

The disorder also presents with multisystemic symptoms, including learning disabilities, neurobehavioral issues, brain iron deposition, anemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Muscle diagnostics reveal increased echogenicity and fatty transformation in muscles, particularly in proximal areas, along with abnormal muscle fiber size variation, internal nuclei, and necrotic fibers (Maio2024CIAO1).

The loss of function in CIAO1 affects the stabilization of its interacting partners, such as FAM96A, leading to compromised biogenesis of multiple Fe-S enzymes. This results in mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by large abnormal mitochondria and decreased levels of respiratory chain complexes, although cellular iron homeostasis is maintained (Maio2024CIAO1).

## Interactions
CIAO1, a component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery, participates in several protein interactions essential for cellular processes. It interacts with the tumor suppressor protein WT1, a relationship characterized by CIAO1's ability to modify the WT1-DNA complex and inhibit WT1-mediated transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner (Johnstone1998Ciao). This interaction is specific, as CIAO1 does not interact with other proteins like the zinc finger transcription factor YY1 (Johnstone1998Ciao).

In Drosophila, CIAO1 interacts with Crumbs (Crb) and Galla proteins, forming complexes that regulate organ growth. The interaction with Crb is confirmed through GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, while CIAO1 binds directly to the conserved C-terminal region of Galla1 (Jung2020Ciao1). CIAO1 also interacts with XPD, a DNA helicase, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation and transcription (Jung2020Ciao1).

In mammals, CIAO1 is part of a multiprotein complex involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. It interacts with proteins such as FAM96B and MMS19, forming a CIA targeting complex crucial for the transfer of Fe-S clusters to recipient proteins (Kim2018Cytosolic). This complex is essential for the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur proteins (Kim2018Cytosolic).
