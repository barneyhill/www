# OSCAR

## Overview
The OSCAR gene encodes the osteoclast-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor, a critical component in bone metabolism and immune system regulation. This receptor is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily expressed on osteoclasts, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Functioning as a collagen receptor, OSCAR binds to specific types of collagen, facilitating osteoclast differentiation and activation, which are essential for bone resorption and remodeling processes (Barrow2011OSCAR). Additionally, OSCAR plays a role in immune responses by associating with the Fc receptor common γ-chain, which triggers signaling pathways involved in antigen presentation and cytokine release (Merck2004OSCAR). The receptor's involvement in both bone and immune system functions underscores its significance in health and disease, with implications in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and certain cancers (Wang2020Sex‐biased; Barrow2011OSCAR).

## Structure
The human osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) is a collagen-binding immune receptor that plays a significant role in osteoclastogenesis and immune responses. Structurally, OSCAR is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and features two immunoglobulin-like domains, D1 and D2, connected by a short linker. These domains form a C2-type immunoglobulin superfamily fold with two beta-sheets, adopting a bent orientation with an interdomain angle of 241°, which is distinct from other leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) members (Zhou2016Structural; Haywood2016Structural).

The D2 domain serves as the primary collagen-binding site, characterized by a groove formed by the curvature of the C9CFG beta-sheet and adjoining loops. This domain binds collagen triple-helical peptides (THP) and collagen-like peptides (CLP) through hydrophobic and polar interactions, involving specific residues such as tyrosine and phenylalanine (Zhou2016Structural; Haywood2016Structural). The D1 domain, while also capable of binding, acts as a secondary site with lower affinity (Zhou2016Structural).

OSCAR is associated with the Fc receptor common γ-chain, which mediates signaling cascades upon ligand binding. The receptor's structure and binding properties are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect the flexibility of the interdomain region (Haywood2016Structural).

## Function
The OSCAR gene encodes a receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in osteoclastogenesis and immune response. In healthy human cells, OSCAR is primarily expressed on osteoclasts, monocytes, and dendritic cells. It functions as a collagen receptor, binding specifically to collagens I, II, and III, which are crucial for bone remodeling. This interaction promotes the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, cells responsible for bone resorption, by inducing intracellular signaling pathways necessary for osteoclast function (Barrow2011OSCAR).

OSCAR is also involved in the immune system, where it is expressed on myeloid cells and dendritic cells. It associates with the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), facilitating antigen presentation and activation of dendritic cells. This interaction triggers calcium mobilization and cytokine release, indicating its role in immune response initiation (Merck2004OSCAR).

In endothelial cells, OSCAR is regulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and influences the expression of cell adhesion proteins, affecting monocyte adhesion and potentially contributing to atherosclerosis development (Goettsch2012Quantitative). These functions highlight OSCAR's involvement in both bone metabolism and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the OSCAR gene have been implicated in several bone-related diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, increased OSCAR expression is associated with enhanced osteoclastogenesis, potentially leading to joint damage due to excessive bone resorption. This is thought to occur through the exposure of OSCAR-binding motifs in collagens by protease activity, which stimulates osteoclast formation (Barrow2011OSCAR). 

In osteoporosis, polymorphisms in the OSCAR promoter have been linked to low bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, suggesting a genetic predisposition to this condition (Barrow2011OSCAR). OSCAR's role in osteoclastogenesis is particularly significant in DAP12-deficient conditions, such as Nasu-Hakola disease, where it can compensate for impaired osteoclast differentiation due to DAP12 deficiency (Barrow2011OSCAR).

OSCAR is also involved in immune responses, with its expression in dendritic cells and monocytes influencing inflammation and immune activation. This suggests potential implications in inflammatory diseases and conditions involving ECM remodeling, such as cancer (Zhou2016Structural; Merck2004OSCAR). In lung adenocarcinoma, OSCAR expression has been associated with tumor proliferation and migration, particularly in female patients, indicating a possible role in cancer progression (Wang2020Sex‐biased).

## Interactions
OSCAR, the osteoclast-associated receptor, is a collagen receptor that plays a significant role in osteoclastogenesis by interacting with extracellular matrix collagens, specifically collagens I, II, and III, and weakly with collagen IV. It does not bind to collagen V or other extracellular matrix proteins like vitronectin or fibronectin. The interaction with collagens is mediated through a specific motif, GPOGPX'GFX', which is essential for OSCAR's role in bone remodeling and osteoclast differentiation (Barrow2011OSCAR).

OSCAR's binding to collagen is facilitated by its D2 domain, which is crucial for the interaction. This binding involves specific residues, including tyrosine residues, which are critical for the receptor's signaling and binding affinity. Mutations in these residues significantly reduce OSCAR's ability to bind collagen (Haywood2016Structural; Zhou2016Structural).

OSCAR also interacts with the Fc receptor common gamma chain (FcRγ) to propagate activating signals in osteoclasts and myeloid cells. This interaction is part of the signaling pathways that regulate osteoclast differentiation and function, particularly in conditions where DAP12 signaling is deficient (Haywood2016Structural; Barrow2011OSCAR).
