# RAB11B

## Overview
RAB11B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the RAS oncogene family, specifically classified as a small GTPase. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly in the recycling of vesicles from endosomes to the plasma membrane. The RAB11B protein is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including the recycling of membrane proteins and the modulation of calcium signaling. It interacts with several proteins, such as Rab11 family-interacting proteins (FIPs), myosin Vb, and EHD proteins, to facilitate its functions in endosomal recycling and membrane transport. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical importance (Silvis2009Rab11b; Zarantonello2021Natural; Best2011Small).

## Function
RAB11B is a small GTPase that is part of the Ras superfamily, playing a crucial role in intracellular membrane trafficking. It is particularly involved in the recycling of vesicles from endosomes to the plasma membrane, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and membrane protein recycling. RAB11B is active in recycling endosomes and is vital for the proper localization and function of various proteins in healthy human cells (Zarantonello2021Natural).

In polarized intestinal epithelial cells, RAB11B regulates the recycling of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a critical anion channel involved in chloride transport. RAB11B ensures the maintenance of CFTR density at the apical membrane, which is crucial for its function in anion secretion. Disruption of RAB11B function leads to impaired CFTR recycling and diminished CFTR-mediated responses, highlighting its essential role in epithelial cell function (Silvis2009Rab11b).

RAB11B also influences the degradation of L-type Cav1.2 calcium channels, affecting their surface membrane density and, consequently, calcium signaling. This regulation is significant in cardiac myocytes, where RAB11B modulates the functional expression of these channels, impacting cardiac muscle physiology (Best2011Small).

## Clinical Significance
RAB11B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, plays a significant role in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lower expression of RAB11B is associated with poorer survival outcomes, higher pathological grades, and increased disease severity. This suggests that RAB11B acts as a protective factor, with higher expression correlating with better overall survival and disease-free survival (Wang2022Bioinformatics). The gene's expression is also linked to liver function indicators, such as T-Bil and GGT levels, which are higher in patients with lower RAB11B expression, indicating more severe disease (Wang2022Bioinformatics).

RAB11B is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. It is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, where it affects amyloid-beta production, a key factor in the disease's pathology (Guadagno2019Rab). In cancer, RAB11B is involved in the trafficking of integrins, which can influence cancer cell invasion and metastasis, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Guadagno2019Rab). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RAB11B in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
RAB11B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and interacts with various proteins to facilitate its functions. It is known to interact with Rab11 family-interacting proteins (FIPs), which play a crucial role in regulating endosomal recycling (Peden2004The). RAB11B also associates with myosin Vb and EHD proteins, which are essential for membrane transport processes, including endocytosis and exocytosis (Peden2004The).

RAB11B's interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SH3BP5 is significant for its activation. SH3BP5 selectively activates RAB11B by facilitating nucleotide exchange through a hydrophobic interface, which is crucial for RAB11B's function in cellular processes (Jenkins2018Structural). Mutations in RAB11B that affect its interaction with SH3BP5 can lead to developmental disorders, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Jenkins2018Structural).

RAB11B also forms complexes with the exocyst complex and motor protein complexes, which are involved in membrane trafficking processes (Jenkins2018Structural). These interactions underscore RAB11B's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various cellular pathways.
