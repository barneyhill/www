# PGBD1

## Overview
PGBD1 is a gene that encodes the protein piggyBac transposable element derived 1, which is a member of the piggyBac transposase-derived protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of neural progenitor cell maintenance and stress response. It functions as a transcriptional repressor and is crucial for inhibiting paraspeckle formation by suppressing the long noncoding RNA NEAT1, thereby maintaining neural progenitor identity (Raskó2021PiggyBac). Additionally, PGBD1 plays a significant role in cellular stress management by interacting with antioxidant enzymes and chaperones, which help modulate reactive oxygen species levels and maintain protein homeostasis (Raskó2021PiggyBac). The gene's involvement in various neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia and spinocerebellar ataxia, underscores its clinical significance (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

## Function
The PGBD1 gene plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal progenitor identity and stress response in healthy human cells. It is highly expressed in neuronal progenitor cells, particularly in the cerebellum, where it helps maintain the progenitor state by activating genes associated with progenitor maintenance and repressing those that promote differentiation (Raskó2021PiggyBac). PGBD1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the long noncoding RNA NEAT1, inhibiting paraspeckle formation, which is essential for neural progenitor cell function (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

In neurons, PGBD1 is involved in stress response regulation, binding to genes associated with homeostatic and cellular stress processes. It interacts with antioxidant enzymes to modulate reactive oxygen species levels, suggesting a role in oxidative stress response (Raskó2021PiggyBac). PGBD1 also interacts with chaperones to dissolve nuclear protein aggregates, highlighting its involvement in maintaining protein homeostasis (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

Overall, PGBD1's functions in neural progenitor maintenance, stress response, and protein homeostasis underscore its importance in neural development and cellular stress management (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

## Clinical Significance
The PGBD1 gene is implicated in several neuronal disorders due to its role in maintaining neural progenitor identity and stress response. Alterations in PGBD1 expression are associated with schizophrenia (SCZ), where its expression is reduced in patients. Genome-wide association studies have identified PGBD1-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SCZ cohorts, highlighting its potential as a susceptibility gene. A missense mutation (N398S) in its transposase-derived domain has been identified, and PGBD1 binds to several SCZ susceptibility genes, such as ERBB4 and NRG1, which are differentially expressed in SCZ patients (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

PGBD1 is also linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Spinocerebellar Ataxia 1 (SCA1) and possibly Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to its interaction with the dystrophin-associated protein complex. Its impairment is associated with these conditions, suggesting a role in their pathophysiology (Raskó2021PiggyBac). PGBD1's involvement in oxidative stress response, through interactions with antioxidant proteins like thioredoxin, connects it to SCZ pathology, as oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage is a hallmark of SCZ-related cognitive deficits (Raskó2021PiggyBac). Despite its potential involvement in Alzheimer's disease, studies have found no significant association between PGBD1 and the disease in certain populations (Ohnuma2012No).

## Interactions
PGBD1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in neural progenitor cells and stress response. It binds to the NEAT1 locus, particularly suppressing the NEAT1_2 isoform, which is crucial for paraspeckle formation. This interaction inhibits paraspeckle formation in neural progenitor cells (Raskó2021PiggyBac). PGBD1 also interacts with several proteins, including members of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, such as Dystrophin (DMD), Dystrobrevin (DTNA, DTNB), and Syntrophin beta 1 and 2 (SNTB1, SNTB2), suggesting a role in modulating neurogenesis processes (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

PGBD1 is involved in stress response by interacting with stress-responsive chaperones like HSPA4, HSPA5, and HSPA8, which are involved in protein quality control. It recruits these chaperones to dissolve nuclear protein aggregates, such as those formed by ATXN1 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (Raskó2021PiggyBac). Additionally, PGBD1 interacts with antioxidant enzymes like PRDX1 and thioredoxin (TXN), modulating reactive oxygen species levels and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Raskó2021PiggyBac).

PGBD1's interactions extend to the SCAN domain family, where it binds a consensus motif shared by several SCAN-ZNF transcription factors, indicating potential protein-protein interactions within this family (Raskó2021PiggyBac).
