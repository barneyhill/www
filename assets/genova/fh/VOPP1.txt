# VOPP1

## Overview
VOPP1, or Vesicular Overexpressed in Cancer Prosurvival Protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to vesicular structures and apoptosis regulation. The VOPP1 protein, characterized by its transmembrane domain, is localized to intracellular membranous structures, where it plays a role in vesicle function and formation (Baras2010Intracellular). As a WW domain binding protein, VOPP1 interacts with the tumor suppressor WWOX, sequestering it in lysosomal vesicles and thereby modulating apoptotic pathways (Bonin2018VOPP1). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where VOPP1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in several types, including breast cancer, due to its role in inhibiting WWOX-dependent apoptosis and promoting cell survival (Bonin2018VOPP1). Additionally, VOPP1 is implicated in the regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity, contributing to its anti-apoptotic properties and involvement in oxidative stress responses (Baras2011Loss).

## Structure


## Function
VOPP1, also known as Vesicular Overexpressed in Cancer Prosurvival Protein 1, is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to its role in intracellular vesicular structures. The protein is processed through the endoplasmic reticulum and contains a transmembrane domain, indicating its localization to intracellular membranous structures rather than being secreted (Baras2010Intracellular). Immunofluorescence studies have shown that VOPP1 is located in intracellular vesicular structures, likely as a component of their membranes, suggesting a role in the function or formation of these vesicles (Baras2010Intracellular).

VOPP1 interacts with the tumor suppressor WWOX, sequestering it in lysosomal vesicles and altering its typical Golgi localization. This interaction affects WWOX's apoptotic function, highlighting VOPP1's role in regulating apoptosis and cellular stress responses (Bonin2018VOPP1). The protein's involvement in apoptosis is further supported by studies showing that VOPP1 knockdown leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels and apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, involving caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction (Baras2011Loss). These findings suggest that VOPP1 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial function.

## Clinical Significance
The VOPP1 gene is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role in cellular processes. In breast cancer, VOPP1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is particularly noted in luminal and luminal B tumor subgroups. It acts as an oncogene by inhibiting the tumor suppressor WWOX, leading to reduced metastasis-free survival in patients with WWOX-positive tumors (Bonin2018VOPP1). VOPP1's interaction with WWOX impairs WWOX-dependent apoptosis, promoting breast tumorigenesis (Bonin2018VOPP1).

VOPP1 is also overexpressed in other cancers, such as glioblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and lymphoma. Its overexpression in these cancers is often independent of gene amplification, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms (Baras2010Intracellular). In squamous cell carcinoma, VOPP1 knockdown induces apoptosis through oxidative cellular injury, highlighting its role in cancer cell survival (Baras2011Loss).

In addition to its role in cancer, VOPP1 is involved in inflammation and apoptosis resistance, as seen in conditions like spinal cord injury and sepsis. Its regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway contributes to these processes (Huang2021Identification).

## Interactions
VOPP1, also known as VOPP1 WW domain binding protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One of the key interactions is with the tumor suppressor WWOX. VOPP1 binds to WWOX through the WW1 domain of WWOX and the PPPY165 motif of VOPP1. This interaction sequesters WWOX in lysosomal vesicles, impairing its ability to associate with the pro-apoptotic protein p73α and inhibiting WWOX-dependent apoptosis (Bonin2018VOPP1). 

VOPP1's interaction with WWOX is significant in breast cancer, where VOPP1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in tumors retaining WWOX expression (Bonin2018VOPP1). The interaction between VOPP1 and WWOX also affects metastasis-free survival rates in breast cancer patients (Bonin2018VOPP1).

In addition to its interaction with WWOX, VOPP1 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity, which contributes to its anti-apoptotic properties (Baras2011Loss). VOPP1 is also implicated in modulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are known triggers of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Baras2011Loss). These interactions highlight VOPP1's role in promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation.
