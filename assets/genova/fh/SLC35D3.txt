# SLC35D3

## Overview
SLC35D3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member D3, which is a member of the solute carrier family involved in nucleotide sugar transport. This protein is characterized as an orphan nucleotide sugar transporter with 10 transmembrane domains, indicating its role in membrane transport processes (Wang2023SLC35D3; Zhang2014Mutation). SLC35D3 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and early endosomes, where it plays a crucial role in glycosylation processes by transporting nucleotide sugars, such as uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, across cellular membranes (Van2024Residence). The protein's interaction with other cellular components, such as the dopamine receptor D1R and NOTCH1, suggests its involvement in significant cellular pathways, including those related to energy metabolism and adipocyte function (Wang2023SLC35D3; Zhang2014Mutation). Alterations in the SLC35D3 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like obesity and metabolic syndrome (Wang2023SLC35D3; Zhang2014Mutation).

## Structure
The SLC35D3 protein is characterized as an orphan nucleotide sugar transporter with 10 transmembrane domains, indicating its role in membrane transport processes (Wang2023SLC35D3; Zhang2014Mutation). The primary structure of the porcine SLC35D3 includes a 423 amino acid polypeptide, which is similar to the human version, suggesting a conserved structure across species (Li2020Molecular). The secondary structure of the porcine SLC35D3 protein consists of 37.12% α-helices, 7.8% β-sheets, and 33.57% random coils (Li2020Molecular). 

The protein lacks a signal peptide, indicating it is not secreted from the cell, and it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and early endosomes (Zhang2014Mutation). SLC35D3 interacts with other proteins, such as the dopamine receptor D1R, through its N-terminal portion, which suggests a role in protein-protein interactions (Zhang2014Mutation). The protein also has potential post-translational modifications, including three O-glycosylation sites and 42 phosphorylation sites, which may influence its function and stability (Li2020Molecular). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
SLC35D3 is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes, playing a significant role in glycosylation processes. This protein is particularly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the modification of proteins and lipids, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper metabolic function. In healthy human cells, SLC35D3 is implicated in the transport of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose into synaptic vesicles, where it may act as an extracellular signaling molecule (Van2024Residence). Additionally, SLC35D3 is detected in early endosomes of megakaryocytes and dense granules of platelets, suggesting its role in supplying UDP-sugars for extracellular glycosylation processes (Van2024Residence). This function is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins, which impacts various cellular processes, including cell signaling and interaction. The presence of SLC35D3 in these cellular compartments indicates its involvement in critical pathways that ensure the correct assembly and function of glycoproteins, which are vital for numerous physiological functions. While the specific functions of SLC35D3 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its role in glycosylation and signaling processes is evident.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC35D3 gene have been linked to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity. Mutations in SLC35D3 can impair dopamine signaling in striatal D1 neurons by causing the accumulation of dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) in the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing its presence on the plasma membrane. This mislocalization leads to impaired dopamine signaling, contributing to MetS and obesity by affecting energy balance and physical activity levels (Zhang2014Mutation). In humans, specific mutations in SLC35D3 have been identified in patients with MetS, which alter the subcellular localization of the protein, further affecting D1R trafficking (Zhang2014Mutation).

In adipose tissue, SLC35D3 plays a role in promoting the browning of white adipose tissue, which is associated with increased energy expenditure and improved metabolic profiles. Knockout of SLC35D3 in adipose tissue leads to increased obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and chronic inflammation, while knock-in models show improved metabolic outcomes. The gene interacts with the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, where its expression inhibits NOTCH1 signaling, promoting adipocyte browning and reducing insulin resistance (Wang2023SLC35D3). These findings suggest that SLC35D3 is a potential therapeutic target for obesity and related metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
SLC35D3 interacts with the NOTCH1 protein, specifically with its extracellular domain (ECD). This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, indicating a physical association between SLC35D3 and NOTCH1. The interaction does not involve the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) (Wang2023SLC35D3). SLC35D3 colocalizes with NOTCH1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that SLC35D3 may regulate the trafficking of NOTCH1 from the ER to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of SLC35D3 results in increased colocalization of NOTCH1 with the ER and decreased NOTCH1 levels at the plasma membrane, indicating that SLC35D3 promotes ER accumulation of NOTCH1 (Wang2023SLC35D3).

This interaction plays a significant role in inhibiting NOTCH1 signaling, which is crucial for the browning of white adipose tissue and energy metabolism. The retention of NOTCH1 in the ER by SLC35D3 reduces its presence on the cell membrane, thereby modulating NOTCH1 signaling pathways (Wang2023SLC35D3). This mechanism highlights the potential of SLC35D3 as a therapeutic target for obesity by influencing NOTCH1 signaling through its interaction with the NOTCH1 ECD (Wang2023SLC35D3).
