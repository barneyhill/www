# RORC

## Overview
The RORC gene encodes the RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORγ), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression across various biological systems. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, RORγ is involved in critical processes such as metabolism, circadian rhythm, and immune function. The protein encoded by RORC is characterized by a modular structure, including a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with specific DNA sequences and ligands, respectively (Medvedev1997Genomic; Pandya2018Combating). RORγ exists in two main isoforms: RORγ1, which is ubiquitously expressed, and RORγt, which is predominantly found in the thymus and certain immune cells, where it is essential for the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and the development of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (Zou2022RORγ). The gene's involvement in immune regulation and metabolic pathways underscores its significance in health and disease, with implications for conditions such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases (Zou2022RORγ; He2022A).

## Structure
The RORC gene encodes the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ), a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein structure of RORγ is modular, comprising several distinct domains. It includes a variable N-terminal activation function (AF-1) domain, a highly conserved central DNA-binding domain (DBD), a flexible hinge region, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Pandya2018Combating). The DBD is located between exons 3 and 4, while the LBD is encoded by exons 6-10 (Medvedev1997Genomic).

The LBD of RORγ is composed of 12 α-helices organized in three layers, with two or three β-strands forming a short sheet structure. This domain is crucial for the interaction with ligands, primarily through a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket (LBP) that allows van der Waals contacts and some polar interactions (Pandya2018Combating). The ligand-bound LBP is situated between helix 12 (H12) and helix 5 (H5) (Pandya2018Combating).

RORγ can form homodimers or heterodimers, influencing its quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect its function. The protein does not have an F domain, and its A/B, C, D, and E domains exhibit varying degrees of homology with other ROR subfamily members (Medvedev1997Genomic).

## Function
The RORC gene encodes the transcription factor RORγ, which is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays a significant role in various biological processes, including metabolism, circadian rhythm, and immune functions. RORγ has two isoforms: RORγ1, which is widely expressed in many tissues, and RORγt, which is highly expressed in the thymus and certain immune cells (Zou2022RORγ). RORγ is involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism. It directly binds to regulatory regions of genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as G6PC and SLC2A2, influencing their expression (Zou2022RORγ).

In the immune system, RORγt is crucial for the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and the development of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), particularly ILC3s. These cells are involved in producing cytokines like IL-17A and IL-22, which are important for immune responses and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity (Croft2022Notch; Zou2022RORγ). RORγt also plays a role in the development of secondary lymphoid organs and is regulated by cytokines such as IL-6 and TGF-β (Zou2022RORγ). RORC's function is influenced by ligand binding, which affects its transcriptional activity (Zou2022RORγ).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RORC gene, which encodes the transcription factor RORγT, have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, RORC expression is differentially regulated, with notable prognostic value in cancers such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, brain lower grade glioma, and mesothelioma. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and cancer immunotherapy response, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2022A). In autoimmune diseases, overexpression of RORC is linked to conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, due to its role in Th17 cell differentiation and inflammatory responses (Zou2022RORγ).

In the context of infections, RORC mutations can lead to impaired Th17 differentiation, increasing susceptibility to fungal infections such as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and mycobacterial diseases, due to compromised IFNγ-dependent immunity (Croft2022Notch). In HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), decreased RORC expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, suggesting that enhancing RORC expression could reduce disease aggressiveness (Subramanian2018Decreased). These findings underscore the diverse roles of RORC in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
RORC, also known as RORγ, is a nuclear receptor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It recognizes and binds to specific DNA response elements known as RORγ response elements (ROREs), which are categorized into classic-ROREs and variant-ROREs. These interactions influence the activation of different gene subsets, with classic-ROREs associated with Th17 cell activation and variant-ROREs linked to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Strutzenberg2021Conformational).

RORC undergoes conformational changes upon binding to ROREs, resulting in an elongation of the protein structure. This involves the DNA-binding domain (DBD) becoming more distant from the ligand-binding domain (LBD), as supported by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) analyses (Strutzenberg2021Conformational).

RORC also interacts with coactivator proteins, particularly the SRC family. The SRC3 coactivator interacts with both the DBD and LBD of RORC, with the HAT interaction domain of SRC3 contacting the C-terminal extension of the RORC DBD. This interaction is crucial for influencing chromatin structure and may regulate RORC activity through ligand-dependent mechanisms (Strutzenberg2021Conformational).
