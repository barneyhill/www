# ACHE

## Overview
The ACHE gene encodes the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a critical component in the nervous system responsible for the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby terminating synaptic transmission. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is essential for maintaining synaptic function and preventing excessive neuronal activation. AChE is expressed in various tissues, particularly those with cholinergic innervation, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, each with distinct roles in the nervous system. Beyond its enzymatic activity, AChE is involved in non-catalytic functions such as neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, and it plays a role in memory formation and stress responses. The enzyme's interactions with other proteins, including those involved in cell adhesion and amyloid plaque formation, underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (Soreq2001Acetylcholinesterase; Zimmerman2006Termination; Marchot2012Enzymatic).

## Structure
Acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) is an enzyme with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in neurotransmission. The primary structure of ACHE consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by a 12-stranded central mixed β-sheet surrounded by 14 α-helices, classifying it as an α/β protein (Sussman1991Atomic). The tertiary structure of ACHE is ellipsoidal, with dimensions approximately 45 x 60 x 65 Å, and features a deep and narrow gorge leading to the active site (Dvir2010Acetylcholinesterase:).

The quaternary structure of ACHE is typically a homodimer, held together by a four-helix bundle and interchain disulfide bonds (Sussman1991Atomic). The active site contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser200, His440, and Glu327, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Sussman1991Atomic). The gorge is lined with aromatic residues, including tryptophan and tyrosine, which are important for substrate binding (Sussman1993Threedimensional).

ACHE also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its function and stability (Sussman1991Atomic). The enzyme's structure is conserved across species, indicating a common evolutionary origin (Sussman1992Acetylcholinesterase:).

## Function
The ACHE gene encodes the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is crucial for terminating synaptic transmission by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in synaptic clefts. This process is essential for maintaining proper synaptic function and preventing prolonged receptor activation, which could lead to neuromuscular and cognitive dysfunctions (Soreq2001Acetylcholinesterase; Zimmerman2006Termination). AChE is widely expressed in tissues with cholinergic innervation, such as neurons and muscle cells, and is also found in non-nervous tissues (Zimmerman2006Termination).

AChE exists in various isoforms due to alternative splicing and promoter choices, resulting in different structural and functional properties. These isoforms include AChE-S, AChE-R, and AChE-E, each with distinct roles in the nervous system. AChE-S is the most abundant form in the nervous system and is involved in forming amphipathic homodimers and homotetramers, which are anchored to membranes by specific proteins (Zimmerman2006Termination). The AChE-R variant, which lacks a membrane anchor, is associated with stress responses and neuronal activity (Soreq2001Acetylcholinesterase).

Beyond its enzymatic role, AChE has non-catalytic functions, such as influencing neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, and is involved in memory formation and stress responses (Zimmerman2006Termination). These diverse roles highlight the enzyme's importance in both synaptic transmission and broader cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACHE gene have significant clinical implications. Polymorphisms in the ACHE promoter, such as a 4-bp deletion and a T→A substitution, affect transcription factor binding sites, leading to increased sensitivity to anti-acetylcholinesterases (anti-AChEs). These mutations are linked to hypersensitivity to chemical stressors, as demonstrated in transgenic mice overexpressing human ACHE (Shapira2000A). 

The ACHE gene is also associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Overexpression of AChE, particularly the AChE-R variant, is linked to stress responses and may contribute to cognitive decline, as seen in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Grisaru1999Structural). In Alzheimer's disease, changes in AChE activity and isoform ratios correlate with disease severity (Zimmerman2006Termination).

Furthermore, the ACHE gene plays a role in hematopoiesis and is implicated in hematopoietic malignancies. Its chromosomal locus is prone to breakage, and gene amplification or mutation can occur in leukemias and other blood disorders (Grisaru1999Structural). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of ACHE gene alterations in various diseases and conditions.

## Interactions
Acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) is involved in various protein interactions that extend beyond its enzymatic role. It interacts with laminin-1beta, a protein involved in cell adhesion, as demonstrated through two-hybrid experiments and confirmed in vitro and in vivo (Marchot2012Enzymatic). ACHE also plays a role in the aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides, associating with amyloid plaques, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Marchot2012Enzymatic).

The peripheral anionic site (PAS) of ACHE is crucial for its interactions with ligands and other proteins. This site mediates the binding of allosteric activators and inhibitors, influencing the enzyme's catalytic activity and facilitating heterologous protein associations during synaptogenesis (Bourne2003Structural). ACHE also interacts with prion protein (PrP) fibrils, affecting their structural properties and potentially playing a role in prion diseases. This interaction is specific and can be modulated by inhibitors like Hup8TH, which decrease ACHE binding to PrP fibrils (Torrent2015Interaction).

Additionally, the N-terminally extended variant of ACHE, N-AChE-S, interacts with proteins involved in apoptotic signaling, such as integrin and GSK3, suggesting a role in cell signaling and apoptosis (Toiber2009Proapoptotic).
