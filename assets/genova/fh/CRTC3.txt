# CRTC3

## Overview
CRTC3, or CREB regulated transcription coactivator 3, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a transcription coactivator. This protein is part of the CRTC family, which also includes CRTC1 and CRTC2, and is characterized by its role in modulating the activity of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein). CRTC3 is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to energy balance and metabolism, by influencing the transcription of genes involved in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. The protein is regulated through phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, such as 14-3-3 proteins and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which affect its localization and activity. Additionally, CRTC3 is subject to regulation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, which targets it for degradation. The gene has been implicated in metabolic disorders, including obesity and type II diabetes, and is also associated with certain cancers, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the salivary glands (Ou2013CRTC3; Song2010CRTC3; Kim2018NEDD4L).

## Structure
The CRTC3 protein is characterized by a modular structure comprising several specific domains. It includes a CREB binding domain (CBD) located at the N-terminus (amino acids 1-50), a regulatory domain (RD) spanning amino acids 51-549, and a trans-activation domain (TAD) at the C-terminus (amino acids 550-619) (Song2010CRTC3). These domains are conserved across the CRTC family, which includes CRTC1 and CRTC2 (Altarejos2011CREB).

CRTC3 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Key phosphorylation sites include Ser62, Ser162, Ser329, and Ser370. Phosphorylation at these sites is crucial for interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, nuclear transport, and CREB coactivator function (Clark2012Phosphorylation). Dephosphorylation of these sites facilitates nuclear translocation and activation of CRTC3 (Clark2012Phosphorylation).

CRTC3 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and function are highly conserved across species, as indicated by the high sequence similarity of porcine CRTC3 with its human counterpart (Liu2018Rapid).

## Function
CRTC3 (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 3) is a protein that functions as a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB, playing a significant role in energy balance and metabolism. In healthy human cells, CRTC3 is involved in catecholamine signaling, which is crucial for energy expenditure and fat metabolism. Under normal conditions, CRTC3 is phosphorylated and inactive, but upon stimulation by cAMP, it becomes dephosphorylated, enters the nucleus, and enhances CREB-mediated transcription. This process is important for the regulation of genes involved in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation (Song2010CRTC3).

CRTC3 also influences the expression of RGS2, a gene associated with metabolic syndrome, affecting insulin and catecholamine signaling. In adipose tissue, CRTC3 modulates lipid metabolism by influencing the transcription of the nuclear hormone receptor PPARc and its coactivator PGC-1a, which can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis (Ou2013CRTC3). The protein's activity is linked to reduced beta adrenergic receptor signaling in adipose tissue, leading to decreased energy expenditure and increased fat accumulation, which is implicated in the development of obesity (Song2010CRTC3). CRTC3's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRTC3 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders and conditions. In the context of obesity, a common human variant of CRTC3, Ser72Asn, has been associated with increased adiposity, particularly in Mexican-American populations. This variant is linked to higher body mass index (BMI) and increased fat storage, suggesting a role in obesity development (Song2010CRTC3). The CRTC3 gene is also implicated in insulin resistance and type II diabetes, as its disruption in mice leads to increased insulin sensitivity and protection against diet-induced obesity (Song2010CRTC3).

In the Chinese Han population, specific polymorphisms in CRTC3, such as rs3862434 and rs11635252, have been associated with altered cholesterol levels and increased risks of overweight and hypertriglyceridemia. The G allele of rs3862434 is linked to lower plasma cholesterol levels, while the T allele of rs11635252 is associated with higher risks of overweight and hypertriglyceridemia (Ou2013CRTC3).

CRTC3 is also involved in cancer, particularly in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the salivary glands. CRTC3-MAML2 fusions have been identified as driver mutations in MEC, contributing to tumorigenesis and serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis (Birkeland2017Correlation; Tasoulas2019Adaptive).

## Interactions
CRTC3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It forms a complex with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through a conserved PP2A-binding region (PBR) located in its central regulatory domain. This interaction is crucial for CRTC3's function and is enhanced by phosphorylation at the S391 site, which is mediated by mitogenic signals via MAPKs and CDKs (Sonntag2019Mitogenic). The binding to PP2A facilitates CRTC3's nuclear translocation and activation of CREB target genes (Sonntag2019Mitogenic).

CRTC3 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which sequester it in the cytoplasm through binding to specific phosphorylation sites. This interaction affects CRTC3's nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity (Sonntag2019Mitogenic).

Additionally, CRTC3 is regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, which targets it for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. This interaction is mediated by the PY motif of CRTC3 and the WW2 domain of NEDD4L, and is enhanced by cAMP signaling (Kim2018NEDD4L). These interactions collectively modulate CRTC3's stability and function in response to various cellular signals.
