# ZNF3

## Overview
ZNF3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 3, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. The protein plays a crucial role in gene expression and regulation, impacting numerous biological pathways and processes. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 3 is implicated in the modulation of gene networks that are essential for cellular differentiation and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
