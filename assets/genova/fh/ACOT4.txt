# ACOT4

## Overview
The ACOT4 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 4, a member of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining intracellular acyl-CoA and free fatty acid levels, thereby influencing energy production and lipid signaling (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2002The). The ACOT4 protein is predominantly localized in peroxisomes, where it exhibits high activity against succinyl-CoA and various dicarboxylic-CoA esters (Brocker2010Evolutionary). Structurally, ACOT4 is characterized by a typical α/β hydrolase fold and functions as a monomer, distinguishing it from other multimeric thioesterases (Swarbrick2020Structure). The regulation of ACOT4 is influenced by PPARα in response to non-esterified fatty acid availability, and its interaction with the chaperone protein HSPA1A is modulated by phosphorylation, impacting its stability and function (Ni2021ACOT4; Swarbrick2020Structure). Clinically, alterations in ACOT4 expression have been associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it serves as a potential biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (Ni2021ACOT4).

## Structure
The human ACOT4 protein is a member of the TE2 family of thioesterases, characterized by its activity against dicarboxylic acyl-CoA esters, particularly succinyl-CoA (Swarbrick2020Structure). The primary structure of ACOT4 consists of 421 amino acids and includes a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal, which directs the protein to peroxisomes (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis). 

The secondary structure of ACOT4 is organized in a sequence of β-strands and α-helices: β1-β2-β3-α1-β4-α2-β5-α3-β6-β7-α4-β8-α5 (Swarbrick2020Structure). The tertiary structure features a typical α/β hydrolase fold, with the active site comprising a catalytic triad of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues. Specifically, Ser 294 is located between β5 and α3, His 422 in the flexible loop between β8 and α5, and Asp 388 in the loop between β7 and α4 (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Swarbrick2020Structure).

ACOT4 is monomeric in its quaternary structure, distinguishing it from other thioesterases with multimeric assemblies (Swarbrick2020Structure). The protein's structure and function are regulated by PPARα in response to non-esterified fatty acid availability (Swarbrick2020Structure).

## Function
The ACOT4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase family, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA. This enzymatic activity is essential for regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids, impacting energy production and lipid signaling (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2002The). ACOT4 is primarily active in peroxisomes, where it exhibits high activity against succinyl-CoA and a variety of short-chain dicarboxylic-CoAs, as well as medium- and long-chain saturated and unsaturated CoAs (Brocker2010Evolutionary).

In humans, ACOT4 combines the functions of several mouse ACOT enzymes, specifically ACOT3, ACOT4, and ACOT5, which are involved in hydrolyzing different chain lengths of acyl-CoA esters. This suggests that human ACOT4 has evolved to perform multiple functions that are distributed among different enzymes in mice (Hunt2006Analysis). The enzyme's activity is significant for fatty acid metabolism and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, which are crucial for energy production and lipid homeostasis in cells (HUNT2008Novel). ACOT4's subcellular localization to peroxisomes is facilitated by a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal, indicating its specialized role in peroxisomal processes (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACOT4 gene have been linked to several cancers, particularly pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC). Elevated ACOT4 expression in PDAC tissues is associated with poorer overall survival and is linked to metastasis, suggesting its role as a biomarker for PDAC progression and poor prognosis (Ni2021ACOT4). The accumulation of ACOT4, mediated by AKT phosphorylation at the S392 site, promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis by producing excessive CoA, which supports tumor cell metabolism (Ni2021ACOT4). Inhibition of AKT can impair ACOT4 stability, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC (Ni2021ACOT4).

In other contexts, ACOT4 expression is not significantly altered in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) compared to normal kidney tissues, suggesting it may not be as relevant in this type of cancer (Xu2020AcylCoA). Additionally, a study on non-syndromic intellectual disability found a variant in ACOT4, but it was deemed unlikely to be associated with the condition due to its high frequency in the Finnish population (Lindholm2019Linkage).

## Interactions
ACOT4 interacts with the chaperone protein HSPA1A, a member of the Hsp70 family, which assists in protein folding and stabilization. This interaction is influenced by the phosphorylation state of ACOT4 at the S392 site. When ACOT4 is unphosphorylated, HSPA1A binds to it, promoting its degradation. However, phosphorylation of ACOT4 at S392, mediated by AKT kinase activity, disrupts this interaction, leading to ACOT4 accumulation and increased stability (Ni2021ACOT4). Specific hydrophobic regions in ACOT4, particularly the I272/P273/P274/L275 sequence, are crucial for its interaction with HSPA1A. Mutations in these regions significantly reduce the interaction with HSPA1A and decrease the enzymatic activity of ACOT4 (Ni2021ACOT4).

The phosphorylation of ACOT4 by AKT at the S392 site is a key regulatory mechanism that affects its stability and accumulation, which in turn influences pancreatic tumorigenesis. This phosphorylation is part of a classic AKT substrate motif and is associated with higher tumor grades and worse prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients (Ni2021ACOT4).
