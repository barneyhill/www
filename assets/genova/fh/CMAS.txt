# CMAS

## Overview
The CMAS gene encodes the enzyme cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, which is integral to the biosynthesis of sialic acids, a family of nine-carbon sugars that play a pivotal role in cellular communication and pathogen interactions. This enzyme is classified as a synthetase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of N-acetylneuraminic acid to CMP-Neu5Ac, a critical step in the sialylation process. Sialylation is essential for the modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing various biological processes such as immune response, cell recognition, and development. The CMAS protein is active in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the formation of sialic acid receptors, which are crucial for interactions with pathogens like the influenza A virus. Mutations in the CMAS gene have been associated with intellectual disabilities and developmental abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Qu2019A; Zhao2021CMAS).

## Function
The CMAS gene encodes the enzyme cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of sialic acids. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac), a key intermediate in the sialylation process. Sialylation is essential for the modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids, impacting cellular communication, immune response, and development (Zhao2021CMAS).

CMAS is active in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the formation of sialic acid receptors. These receptors are important for various cellular interactions, including the initial attachment of influenza A viruses to host cells, as the viral hemagglutinin binds to these receptors (Zhao2021CMAS). The enzyme's activity is vital for the proper functioning of sialyltransferases, which add sialic acid to the terminal ends of polysaccharides, glycolipids, and glycoproteins, influencing processes such as immune system function, cell recognition, and nervous system development (Qu2019A).

Mutations in the CMAS gene can lead to impaired sialylation, affecting normal brain and skeletal development, and have been associated with intellectual disability (Qu2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CMAS gene have been linked to autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ID) in humans. A study identified a homozygous mutation, NM_018686.3:c.563G > A (p.Arg188His), in a Kazakh family, which was associated with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, lack of speech acquisition, and potential skeletal problems. This mutation affects a conserved residue in the dimerization domain of the CMAS protein, potentially disrupting protein dimerization and activity, which may contribute to the observed phenotypes (Qu2019A).

The CMAS gene also plays a role in viral infections, particularly in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV). CMAS is involved in the synthesis of sialic acid receptors, which are crucial for the adsorption of IAVs to host cells. Knockout studies in NPTr cells demonstrated that the absence of CMAS impairs the synthesis of these receptors, significantly inhibiting IAV proliferation. This suggests that CMAS is significant in the replication of IAV, and alterations in its expression or function could impact viral infections (Zhao2021CMAS).

## Interactions
CMAS (cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase) is known to interact with fragile X related protein 1 (FXR1P). This interaction was initially identified using a yeast two-hybrid system, which confirmed the interaction through β-galactosidase activity assays (Ma2016CMPNacetylneuraminic). The interaction was further validated by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells, where tagged versions of FXR1P and CMAS were co-transfected, and both proteins were detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes (Ma2016CMPNacetylneuraminic). Subcellular colocalization studies using fluorescence microscopy showed that FXR1P and CMAS colocalize in the cytoplasm and around the nucleus in HEK293T and HeLa cells, suggesting that they can form complexes in specific cellular compartments (Ma2016CMPNacetylneuraminic).

CMAS also interacts with the influenza A virus matrix protein 1 (M1). This interaction was demonstrated through co-transfection experiments in 293T cells, where CMAS and M1 were shown to colocalize, indicating a potential role in the early stages of the influenza virus life cycle (Zhao2021CMAS). These interactions suggest that CMAS may play a role in various cellular processes and viral interactions.
