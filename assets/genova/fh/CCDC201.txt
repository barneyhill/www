# CCDC201

## Overview
The CCDC201 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 201 protein, which is implicated in reproductive health, particularly in women. This protein is categorized as a coiled-coil domain-containing protein, which suggests a structural role in cellular processes. The gene is predominantly expressed in female reproductive tissues, including the ovary, breast, and placenta, with the highest expression observed in ovarian tissue among premenopausal women. The CCDC201 protein is a downstream target of the oocyte-specific transcription factor FIGLA, indicating its potential involvement in primordial follicle development and oocyte survival. Mutations in CCDC201, such as the stop-gain variant p.(Arg162Ter), have been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency and early menopause, underscoring its clinical significance in reproductive health (Oddsson2024Homozygosity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC201 gene, particularly the stop-gain variant p.(Arg162Ter), have been associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and early menopause (EM) in women. This variant is located in the last exon of the gene and is predicted to result in a truncated protein, potentially leading to loss of function. Women who are homozygous for this variant tend to experience menopause approximately nine years earlier than noncarriers or heterozygotes, significantly impacting their reproductive health (Oddsson2024Homozygosity). The variant is rare, with a higher frequency in northern Europeans, and is estimated to cause POI in about 0.19% of cases (Oddsson2024Homozygosity). 

The CCDC201 gene is expressed predominantly in female tissues such as the ovary, breast, and placenta, with the highest expression in ovarian tissue among premenopausal women. It is also a downstream target of the oocyte-specific transcription factor FIGLA, suggesting a role in primordial follicle development and/or oocyte survival (Oddsson2024Homozygosity). The study emphasizes the importance of genetic counseling and treatment for symptoms of early menopause in affected individuals, highlighting the significant impact of the p.(Arg162Ter) variant on reproductive health (Oddsson2024Homozygosity).
