# INSL4

## Overview
INSL4 (insulin-like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the insulin superfamily, which is primarily expressed in the placenta. The protein, also known as early placental insulin-like peptide, is characterized by its structure as a preprohormone, comprising a signal peptide, B-chain, C-peptide, and A-chain. Despite its structural similarities to other insulin superfamily members, INSL4 exhibits distinct conformational properties, lacking a hydrophobic core and helical structure at physiological pH (Lin2003Synthetic). While the precise biological functions of the INSL4 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in cellular processes such as growth and differentiation, particularly within the context of placental development. The gene's expression and potential involvement in signaling pathways underscore its significance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions, including its role in the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (Scopetti2021INSL4; Scopetti2020Epigenetic).

## Structure
The INSL4 protein, also known as early placental insulin-like peptide, is a member of the insulin superfamily. It is encoded by a gene that produces a 139-residue peptide with a structure characteristic of a preprohormone, including a signal peptide, B-chain, C-peptide, and A-chain (Lin2003Synthetic). The synthetic INSL4 peptide consists of a B-chain with 33 amino acids and an A-chain with 25 amino acids, linked by three disulfide bonds formed through regioselective methods (Lin2003Synthetic). 

The secondary structure of the synthetic INSL4 peptide, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, shows a single negative band at 203 nm in water, indicating type I (III) beta turns. In a membrane-like environment, the peptide assumes a more ordered structure, but the dominant conformation remains a series of reverse-turns, which is distinct from other insulin superfamily members (Lin2003Synthetic). 

The INSL4 protein lacks a hydrophobic core and helical structure at physiological pH, and no specific target tissue or binding activity to known receptors has been identified (Millar2005Early). The in vivo structural identity and potential function of INSL4 remain unknown, and it does not activate the G-protein-coupled receptors LGR7 or LGR8 (Lin2003Synthetic).

## Function
INSL4 (insulin-like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the insulin superfamily, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell growth and differentiation. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta, suggesting its involvement in placental development and function. INSL4 is believed to influence cell signaling pathways that regulate cellular proliferation and tissue development, which are crucial for maintaining healthy cellular and organismal functions. The protein's activity in these pathways underscores its importance in ensuring proper placental development, which is vital for fetal growth and maternal health during pregnancy. The specific molecular activities of INSL4 within the cell, while not fully elucidated, are thought to involve interactions with other proteins and signaling molecules that modulate these critical biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
INSL4 (insulin-like 4) has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in adenocarcinoma subtypes. Overexpression of INSL4 is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in NSCLC patients. This overexpression promotes cell growth, invasiveness, and migration by activating the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for tumor development and progression (Scopetti2021INSL4; Scopetti2020Epigenetic). 

In the context of LKB1-inactivated lung cancers, INSL4 expression is notably higher and correlates with worse overall survival and shorter time to first progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients. The gene's expression is linked to advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and larger tumor size, suggesting its role in sustaining the growth and viability of these cancer cells through PI3K-Akt and/or MAPK signaling pathways (Yang2018Role).

The discrepancy between INSL4 mRNA and protein levels in different NSCLC cell lines and patient samples suggests individual epigenetic control, complicating its role as a prognostic marker. Despite these challenges, INSL4 remains a potential target for therapeutic intervention in NSCLC (Scopetti2021INSL4; Scopetti2020Epigenetic).
