# ZNF80

## Overview
ZNF80 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 80, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains are known for their ability to bind DNA, RNA, or proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. The ZNF80 protein consists of 273 amino acids and features seven tandemly repeated zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its function as a transcription factor (Di1995Characterization). The gene is selectively expressed in certain hematopoietic cell lineages, with its expression regulated by an endogenous retroviral element, suggesting a specialized role in hematopoietic cell function and development (Di1995Characterization).

## Structure
The ZNF80 protein is encoded by a 1053 bp open reading frame, resulting in a polypeptide of 273 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31,229 Da (Di1995Characterization). The primary structure of ZNF80 includes seven tandemly repeated zinc finger domains, which are characteristic motifs that facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or proteins. These zinc finger domains are flanked by 50 amino acids at the N-terminus and 34 amino acids at the C-terminus (Di1995Characterization).

The secondary structure of ZNF80 likely involves typical zinc finger motifs, which often include alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure, which refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, is not detailed in the available information. There is no mention of a quaternary structure, suggesting that ZNF80 may function as a monomer.

The ZNF80 gene is expressed selectively in certain hematopoietic cell lineages, and its expression is driven by a solitary LTR of the ERV9 endogenous retroviral family, which acts as a promoter (Di1995Characterization). The presence of an ERV9-LTR element in the cDNA suggests a role in transcription regulation (Di1995Characterization).
