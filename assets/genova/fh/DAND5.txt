# DAND5

## Overview
DAND5 is a gene that encodes the protein DAN domain BMP antagonist family member 5, which is part of the Cerberus/DAN family of proteins. This protein functions as an extracellular antagonist of the TGF-β/Nodal signaling pathway, playing a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in cardiac differentiation and left-right asymmetry. By binding to the NODAL ligand and its (co)receptors, DAND5 inhibits the interaction between agonists and receptors, thereby modulating signaling pathways crucial for proper embryonic patterning and heart development (Inácio2023GeneEdited; Inácio2021DAND5). The protein's regulatory functions extend to interactions with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt ligands, further influencing developmental processes (Inácio2021DAND5). Mutations in the DAND5 gene have been linked to congenital heart diseases and laterality defects, underscoring its clinical significance (Ganapathi2022A; Cristo2017Functional).

## Function
The DAND5 gene encodes an extracellular protein that is a member of the Cerberus/DAN family, functioning primarily as an antagonist of the TGF-β/Nodal signaling pathway. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating embryonic development, particularly in cardiac differentiation and development. DAND5 achieves its regulatory function by binding directly to the NODAL ligand and/or its (co)receptors, thereby preventing the interaction between agonists and receptors, which suppresses subsequent signaling activation (Inácio2023GeneEdited; Inácio2021DAND5).

In the context of cardiomyocyte differentiation, DAND5 is involved in controlling the proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Reduced levels of DAND5 lead to prolonged TGF-β/Nodal and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which increases the number of cardiovascular progenitors and extends their progenitor state (Inácio2023GeneEdited). In human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), DAND5 inactivation results in increased cardiomyocyte proliferation, although these cells exhibit less organized sarcomeres and a more fetal-like cardiac phenotype, indicating delayed cardiac maturity (Inácio2023GeneEdited).

DAND5 also plays a role in maintaining the balance between cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, which is essential for normal heart development and function (Inácio2023GeneEdited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DAND5 gene have been implicated in several congenital conditions, particularly those affecting heart development and laterality. A specific missense variant, c.455G>A (p.R152H), has been identified in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and laterality defects. This variant is located in a highly conserved region of the DAND5 protein and has been shown to reduce its NODAL-inhibitory activity, potentially disrupting normal left-right patterning during embryonic development (Cristo2017Functional). The presence of this variant in individuals with severe heart malformations, such as ventricular septal defects and pulmonary atresia, suggests a link between DAND5 mutations and these conditions (Cristo2017Functional).

Additionally, a novel biallelic loss-of-function variant in DAND5, c.197del (p.Leu66ArgfsTer22), has been associated with heterotaxy syndrome, characterized by abnormal organ arrangement. This variant disrupts the DAND5 protein's ability to inhibit nodal signaling, crucial for right-left patterning, leading to heart defects and other developmental abnormalities (Ganapathi2022A).

Research using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has shown that DAND5 mutations can lead to increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and altered electrophysiological properties, which may contribute to CHD (Inácio2023GeneEdited). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DAND5 in heart-related conditions.

## Interactions
DAND5, a member of the DAN family of BMP antagonists, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate embryonic development and left-right asymmetry. It functions as an extracellular protein that binds to the ligand Nodal, preventing its interaction with receptors and subsequent signaling activation. This interaction is crucial for modulating the TGF-β/Nodal signaling pathway, which is essential for proper embryonic patterning (Inácio2021DAND5).

DAND5 also interacts with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt ligands, inhibiting their signaling pathways. This inhibition is significant in various developmental processes and can influence cardiac differentiation by affecting the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes (Nolan2014The; Inácio2021DAND5).

In the context of left-right asymmetry, DAND5 mRNA is regulated post-transcriptionally by the RNA-binding protein Bicc1, which binds to the 3′-UTR of DAND5 mRNA. This interaction is part of a complex regulatory network involving Dicer and the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex, which facilitates the decay of DAND5 mRNA on the left side of the node in response to fluid flow (Minegishi2021Fluid; Maerker2021Bicc1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of DAND5 in developmental signaling pathways.
