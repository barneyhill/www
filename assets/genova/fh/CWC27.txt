# CWC27

## Overview
CWC27 is a gene that encodes the CWC27 spliceosome-associated cyclophilin, a protein involved in the pre-mRNA splicing process within eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is integral to the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. The CWC27 protein contains an inactive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain, which, despite its lack of enzymatic activity, plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions during spliceosome assembly (Busetto2020Structural). CWC27 forms a heterodimer with CWC22, facilitating the recruitment of the exon junction complex (EJC) component eIF4A3, which is essential for mRNA processing (Bertrand2021Cwc27). Mutations in the CWC27 gene have been linked to various clinical phenotypes, including retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis, underscoring its importance in both splicing and broader developmental processes (Bertrand2021Cwc27; Xu2017Mutations).

## Function
CWC27 is a splicing factor involved in the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. It contains an inactive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain and a long disordered region. In both yeast and humans, the PPIase domain is visible in spliceosome cryo-EM structures and plays a conserved role during spliceosome assembly (Busetto2020Structural). CWC27 forms a heterodimer with CWC22, which serves as a landing platform for the exon junction complex (EJC) core component eIF4A3. This interaction is crucial for the transition from B to B* spliceosome complexes (Busetto2020Structural).

CWC27 is involved in the recruitment of eIF4A3 to the spliceosome, a critical step in mRNA processing. It stabilizes the interaction between CWC22 and eIF4A3, which is important for the function of the EJC in spliceosomes (Busetto2020Structural). The protein is not present in the C complex of the spliceosome after the first catalytic splicing reaction, suggesting its role is primarily in the early stages of spliceosome assembly and function (Busetto2020Structural). CWC27 is essential for maintaining normal splicing and gene expression patterns, particularly in pathways linked to inflammation (Busetto2020Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CWC27 gene are associated with a range of clinical phenotypes, primarily affecting the retina and leading to conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). These mutations can manifest in both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of retinal degeneration, with a recessive inheritance pattern (Bertrand2021Cwc27; Xu2017Mutations). In addition to retinal degeneration, individuals with CWC27 mutations may exhibit brachydactyly, craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, and neurological defects, highlighting the gene's role in broader developmental processes (Xu2017Mutations).

The severity of the phenotypes is influenced by the specific mutations within the CWC27 gene. For instance, more N-terminal truncations are linked to more severe phenotypes, while other mutations may result in isolated retinal degeneration (Xu2017Mutations). In mouse models, mutations such as the Cwc27 K338fs lead to significant splicing changes in retinal cells, including increased intron retention and alternative exon usage, which are associated with photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration (Bertrand2021Cwc27). These splicing defects may activate endoplasmic reticulum stress and contribute to the disease mechanism (Bertrand2021Cwc27).

## Interactions
CWC27, also known as SDCCAG10, is involved in several protein-protein interactions within the spliceosome complex. It directly interacts with Prp8p (the human PRPF8 homolog) and Brr2p (the human SNRNP200 homolog) in the spliceosome B act complex, suggesting a role in transitioning the spliceosome from the pre-catalytic to catalytic state (Xu2017Mutations). Although CWC27 has lost its isomerase activity, it retains the ability to bind proline, which may facilitate these interactions (Ulrich2014Structure).

The C-terminal region of CWC27 interacts with CWC22 to form a platform that recruits eIF4A3, a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), to the spliceosome (Bertrand2021Cwc27). This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the complete EJC, which is essential for mRNA processing. CWC27 is released from the spliceosome before the conversion to the B* complex, indicating its role is specific to certain stages of spliceosome assembly (Bertrand2021Cwc27).

The structural analysis of CWC27 suggests that its mainly helical, solvent-exposed C-terminus may facilitate interactions with other proteins, although specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed (Ulrich2014Structure).
