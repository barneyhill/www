# NRG3

## Overview
Neuregulin 3 (NRG3) is a gene that encodes the protein neuregulin 3, a member of the neuregulin family involved in neural development and function. The NRG3 protein is characterized by its unique structure, including an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif that facilitates its interaction with the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase, a critical component in various signaling pathways. These pathways are essential for processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS) (Zhang1997Neuregulin3). NRG3 plays a significant role in the development of the CNS, influencing the survival of oligodendrocyte precursors and the migration of interneuronal precursors, as well as in mammary gland development (Howard2008The; Carteron2006Characterization). Clinically, NRG3 has been associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, with genetic variations in the gene affecting its expression and splicing, thereby contributing to the phenotypic features of these conditions (Avramopoulos2017Neuregulin; Paterson2017Temporal).

## Structure
The NRG3 protein is composed of 720 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 77,901 Da (Zhang1997Neuregulin3). Its primary structure includes a unique Ala/Gly-rich segment at the N-terminus, a mucin-like Ser/Thr-rich region with abundant O-linked glycosylation sites, and an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif (Zhang1997Neuregulin3). The EGF-like domain is crucial for its function, as it specifically binds to the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase, stimulating its tyrosine phosphorylation (Zhang1997Neuregulin3).

NRG3 lacks the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) or kringle domains found in many NRG1 family members, distinguishing it structurally from other neuregulins (Zhang1997Neuregulin3). It features two hydrophobic segments that may serve as a transmembrane domain and an internal signal sequence (Zhang1997Neuregulin3). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is common in the mucin-like region (Zhang1997Neuregulin3).

The EGF-like domain of NRG3 is distinct from those of NRG1 and NRG2, indicating that it is not an alternatively spliced form of these proteins (Zhang1997Neuregulin3). The binding affinity of NRG3 to ErbB4 is estimated to be 9 ± 4 nM, highlighting its specific interaction with this receptor (Zhang1997Neuregulin3).

## Function
NRG3 (neuregulin 3) is a member of the neuregulin family, which plays a significant role in neural development and function. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is involved in processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. NRG3 specifically binds to the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase, activating signaling pathways that are crucial for neural development, including the PI 3-kinase pathway, which promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis (Zhang1997Neuregulin3; Carteron2006Characterization).

In the CNS, NRG3 is implicated in the survival of oligodendrocyte precursors, which are essential for myelination, a process critical for proper neuronal function. It activates the PI 3-kinase pathway, leading to Akt phosphorylation, which supports oligodendrocyte survival under stress conditions (Carteron2006Characterization). NRG3 is also involved in cortical development, influencing the migration of interneuronal precursors and the establishment of radial glia (Rahman2018Developmental).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, NRG3 is involved in mammary gland development. It interacts with ERBB4 to influence mammary differentiation and the formation of mammary placodes, which are essential for gland development (Howard2008The).

## Clinical Significance
The NRG3 gene has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. Variants in NRG3, such as rs10748842, are associated with increased expression of certain transcripts in brain regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, influencing the presentation of psychosis and delusions in schizophrenia patients (Avramopoulos2017Neuregulin; Kao2010Common). These genetic variations can lead to altered splicing and expression of NRG3 isoforms, contributing to the disease's phenotypic features rather than the overall risk (Avramopoulos2017Neuregulin).

NRG3 is also linked to other psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder and major depression, where specific isoforms show increased expression in affected individuals (Paterson2017Temporal). The gene's involvement extends to non-psychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, smoking behavior, and body mass index, highlighting its pleiotropic effects (Avramopoulos2017Neuregulin).

Animal models, such as Nrg3 knockout mice, exhibit schizophrenia-related phenotypes, supporting the gene's role in psychiatric diseases (Avramopoulos2017Neuregulin). The complex splicing and regulation of NRG3 suggest that its dysregulation may contribute to the developmental origins of these disorders (Paterson2017Temporal).

## Interactions
Neuregulin 3 (NRG3) primarily interacts with the ErbB4 receptor, a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This interaction is crucial for the formation and function of excitatory synapses on hippocampal interneurons. NRG3 binds to ErbB4 through its EGF-like domain, which is essential for this interaction, as demonstrated by the failure of a version of NRG3 lacking the EGF domain to bind ErbB4 (Müller2018Neuregulin; Zhang1997Neuregulin3). The binding of NRG3 to ErbB4 can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor, initiating downstream signaling pathways (Zhang1997Neuregulin3).

NRG3 also interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin1, which is involved in the regulation of glutamate release. This interaction suggests a role for NRG3 in modulating the assembly of the SNARE complex, which is critical for vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release (Wang2018Controlling). The presence of NRG3 at axonal varicosities and its colocalization with synaptic markers such as bassoon and PSD-95 further supports its involvement in synaptic function and development (Vullhorst2017Structural). These interactions highlight NRG3's role in neural signaling and synapse formation.
