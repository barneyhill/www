# WDR70

## Overview
WDR70 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 70 protein, which is integral to several cellular processes, including DNA repair and RNA splicing. The protein is characterized by the presence of a WD40 domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, forming a beta-propeller structure essential for stabilizing the human step 1 spliceosome (Bertram2020Structural). As a component of the CRL4 complex, WD repeat domain 70 plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response, particularly in the regulation of histone H2B monoubiquitination, which is crucial for DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70). The protein's interactions with the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome further enhance DNA resection, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Zeng2022Mechanistic). Mutations in WDR70 have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in preventing genomic instability and its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2019The).

## Structure
The WDR70 protein is characterized by the presence of a WD40 domain, which is a common structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions. This domain forms a beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for its function in stabilizing the human step 1 spliceosome. The WD40 domain of WDR70 interacts with several other proteins and RNA structures, including PRP8, BUD31, and PRP17, to stabilize the U2 snRNA stem IIc and the remodeled PRP8 En-NTD interface (Bertram2020Structural). 

The WDR70 protein also contains a C-terminal region that interacts with various proteins across the catalytic core of the spliceosome, positioning PPWD1 PPIase close to the intron upstream of the BS/U2 helix (Bertram2020Structural). This region is supported by numerous inter-molecular crosslinks, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the spliceosome complex (Bertram2020Structural).

In addition to its role in the spliceosome, WDR70 is involved in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. It interacts with the CRL4 subunit, Ddb1, through a 'DWD' motif, facilitating homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in both splicing and DNA repair processes.

## Function
WDR70 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in crucial cellular processes, particularly in DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, WDR70 is a component of the CRL4 complex, which plays a significant role in the DNA damage response. It is involved in the regulation of H2B monoubiquitination, a histone modification essential for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. This modification facilitates DNA resection, a critical step for homologous recombination (HR), a precise DNA repair pathway (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70).

WDR70 also interacts with the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, forming a complex that enhances DNA resection by promoting the degradation of anti-resection factors like ADRM1 Rpn13. This interaction is crucial for the proper repair of DSBs through HR, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Zeng2022Mechanistic). Additionally, WDR70 stabilizes the human step 1 spliceosome, contributing to the structural integrity of the spliceosome and ensuring accurate RNA splicing (Bertram2020Structural). Through these roles, WDR70 is integral to cellular homeostasis and the prevention of genomic instability, which can lead to carcinogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WDR70 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Loss-of-function mutations in WDR70 have been identified in ovarian cancer, suggesting its role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing malignant transformation (Cheng2019The). The gene is involved in the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B, a process crucial for chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Dysfunction in this pathway can lead to genomic instability, contributing to cancer development (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70).

In the context of DNA repair, WDR70 is part of the CRL4 complex, which regulates H2B monoubiquitination and facilitates Exo1-dependent resection during DNA double-strand break repair. Its absence shifts the repair mechanism from homologous recombination to non-homologous end joining, increasing sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70). This shift can lead to improper DNA repair and contribute to carcinogenesis.

WDR70 has also been mentioned in genetic studies of thymic epithelial tumors, although the clinical relevance of these mutations remains unclear due to insufficient functional characterization (Szpechcinski2022Targeted). Overall, WDR70's role in DNA repair and genomic stability underscores its potential significance in cancer and other diseases associated with genomic instability.

## Interactions
WDR70 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA damage response and repair. It forms part of the CRL4 WDR70 complex, which includes Ddb1 and is involved in regulating H2B monoubiquitination, a key histone modification at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70). This complex interacts with the HULC Rhp6 complex, which includes the E2 ligase Rhp6 and the E3 ligase Brl1, to modulate chromatin structure and facilitate DNA resection (Zeng2016CRL4Wdr70).

WDR70 also interacts with the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, forming a complex known as CDW19S, which is involved in DSB repair by influencing chromatin associated with breaks (Zeng2022Mechanistic). This interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage, such as treatment with camptothecin, and is conserved across species, including in human cells (Zeng2022Mechanistic).

Additionally, WDR70 is involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ADRM1 Rpn13, a protein associated with chromatin, which is necessary for distal resection during DNA repair (Zeng2022Mechanistic). This degradation process is facilitated by the interaction between CRL4 WDR70 and specific subunits of the 19S proteasome complex (Zeng2022Mechanistic).
