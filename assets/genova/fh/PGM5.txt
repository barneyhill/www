# PGM5

## Overview
Phosphoglucomutase 5 (PGM5) is a gene that encodes the protein phosphoglucomutase 5, also known as aciculin. Unlike other members of the phosphoglucomutase family, PGM5 does not exhibit enzymatic activity but instead serves a structural role within muscle cells. The protein is primarily involved in the assembly, remodeling, and maintenance of myofibrils, which are critical for muscle fiber integrity and function (Gustafsson2020Structure; Stiers2017Biology). PGM5 is expressed in various muscle tissues, including cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle, and is developmentally regulated (Stiers2017Biology). It interacts with several cytoskeletal proteins, such as dystrophin, utrophin, filamin C, and Xin proteins, contributing to the structural organization of the cytoskeleton at adherens-type cellular junctions (Muenks2017Sequencestructure). Additionally, PGM5 is implicated in cellular growth and maintenance, with its expression modulated by cell proliferation (Gustafsson2020Structure).

## Function
Phosphoglucomutase 5 (PGM5), also known as aciculin, is a protein that plays a structural role in muscle cells rather than a catalytic one. Despite its sequence similarity to other members of the phosphoglucomutase family, PGM5 lacks enzymatic activity. Instead, it is involved in the assembly, remodeling, and maintenance of myofibrils, which are essential components of muscle fibers (Gustafsson2020Structure; Stiers2017Biology). PGM5 is expressed in cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle, where it is developmentally regulated and enriched (Stiers2017Biology).

PGM5 interacts with several large cytoskeletal proteins, including dystrophin, utrophin, filamin C, and Xin proteins, which are crucial for the structural integrity and function of muscle cells (Gustafsson2020Structure; Stiers2017Biology). These interactions suggest that PGM5 is involved in the structural organization of the cytoskeleton at adherens-type cellular junctions, contributing to muscle cell stability and function (Muenks2017Sequencestructure).

In humans, PGM5 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the bladder and digestive system, indicating its importance in these areas (Gustafsson2020Structure). Its expression is modulated by cell proliferation, suggesting a role in cellular growth and maintenance (Gustafsson2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PGM5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. PGM5 is significantly downregulated in several tumors, including breast and colon cancer, and is considered a downregulated tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer, suggesting its potential as a predictor and treatment target for this type of cancer (Liu2021A). The Ile98Val mutation in PGM5 is identified as oncogenic in stomach cancer, highlighting its role in oncogenesis (Gustafsson2020Structure; Simpson2019Systematic). 

PGM5 expression is associated with different survival rates across cancer types. High expression correlates with better survival in clear-cell renal carcinoma and cervical cancer, while low expression is linked to poor prognosis in lung squamous-cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma (Liu2021A). 

PGM5 also plays a role in myogenesis and is involved in pathways such as UV response and Hedgehog signaling, which are relevant to cancer progression (Liu2021A). Its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins are crucial for muscle function, and disruptions in these interactions may contribute to disease (Gustafsson2020Structure).

## Interactions
PGM5, also known as phosphoglucomutase 5, is primarily involved in structural roles within the cell rather than enzymatic activity. It interacts with several cytoskeletal proteins, playing a significant role in muscle structure and function. In humans, PGM5 interacts with dystrophin and utrophin, which are crucial for muscle integrity and are associated with inherited muscle dystrophies (Gustafsson2020Structure; Stiers2017Biology). PGM5 also binds to filamin C, a multi-adaptor protein important in cardiac and skeletal muscle function, and Xin proteins (XinA and XinB), which are involved in myofibril assembly and maintenance (Gustafsson2020Structure; Stiers2017Biology).

These interactions suggest that PGM5 is integral to the assembly and remodeling of myofibrils, contributing to the maintenance of muscle cell structure. Despite its structural similarities to other phosphoglucomutases, PGM5 lacks enzymatic activity, which distinguishes it from other members of the phosphohexomutase superfamily (Gustafsson2020Structure). The protein's interactions with cytoskeletal components highlight its role in maintaining cellular architecture and potentially influencing cell shape and motility.
