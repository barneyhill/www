# MUTYH

## Overview
The MUTYH gene encodes the enzyme mutY DNA glycosylase, a critical component of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is responsible for correcting oxidative DNA damage. This enzyme specifically targets adenine bases mispaired with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a common lesion resulting from oxidative stress, thereby preventing G:C to T:A transversion mutations and maintaining genomic stability (Parker2003Human; Dorn2014Regulation). The mutY DNA glycosylase is categorized as a DNA glycosylase, a type of enzyme that excises damaged bases from DNA. MUTYH is expressed in various isoforms, allowing it to function in both the nucleus and mitochondria, and it interacts with other DNA repair proteins to enhance its activity (Gu2002Human; Parker2003Human). Mutations in the MUTYH gene are associated with MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), an autosomal recessive disorder that significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer (Cheadle2007MUTYHassociated; Venesio2012MUTYHassociated).

## Structure
The MUTYH protein is a DNA glycosylase involved in the base excision repair pathway, specifically targeting adenine mispaired with 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). The protein structure includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal domain features a helix-hairpin-helix motif, which is crucial for DNA binding and recognition (Parker2003Human). The C-terminal domain contains the catalytic core, which is essential for the glycosylase activity of MUTYH (Gu2024Mutations).

MUTYH also possesses a NUDIX domain, which, while not essential for catalytic activity, plays a role in substrate recognition and processing efficiency of A:oxoG pairs (Torgasheva2022Noncatalytic). The protein includes a zinc linchpin motif, important for efficient DNA damage repair (Torgasheva2022Noncatalytic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are significant for MUTYH's function. Phosphorylation at Serine 524, located in the C-terminal OG recognition domain, affects the protein's stability and DNA binding affinity (Kundu2010Ser).

MUTYH is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which affects its subcellular localization. Some isoforms are targeted to the mitochondria, while others are localized to the nucleus (Köger2019Analysis; Parker2003Human).

## Function
The MUTYH gene encodes the MutY DNA glycosylase enzyme, which plays a critical role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, a key mechanism for correcting oxidative DNA damage in healthy human cells. This enzyme specifically targets and removes adenine bases that are mispaired with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a common oxidative lesion caused by reactive oxygen species. By excising these mispaired adenines, MUTYH prevents G:C to T:A transversion mutations, thereby maintaining genomic stability and reducing the risk of carcinogenesis (Parker2003Human; Dorn2014Regulation).

MUTYH is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, reflecting its role in protecting the integrity of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The enzyme interacts with other proteins involved in DNA repair, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and MSH6, which enhance its activity and integration into broader DNA repair networks (Parker2003Human). The regulation of MUTYH, including its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Mule, is crucial for modulating its protein levels and recruitment to chromatin, which is essential for effective DNA repair and cancer prevention (Dorn2014Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MUTYH gene are primarily associated with MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Cheadle2007MUTYHassociated; Venesio2012MUTYHassociated). Biallelic mutations in MUTYH are found in approximately 30% of APC mutation-negative polyposis cases, though they account for less than 1% of all CRC cases (Venesio2012MUTYHassociated). The most common mutations in European populations are Y179C and G396D (Venesio2012MUTYHassociated).

MAP is linked to a high level of oxidative damage in the large bowel, leading to G:C to T:A transversion mutations in tumors (Cheadle2007MUTYHassociated). The risk of CRC in MAP patients is significantly higher, estimated to be 28- to 93-fold compared to the general population (Mazzei2013Role). Monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers have a modestly increased risk of CRC, particularly for specific variants like Y179C (Mazzei2013Role).

Altered expression of MUTYH has been observed in other conditions, such as gastric cancer, where reduced protein levels are associated with poor prognosis (Venesio2012MUTYHassociated). MUTYH also plays a role in maintaining intestinal integrity in inflammatory conditions like ulcerative colitis, where its altered expression is linked to tumor development (Venesio2012MUTYHassociated).

## Interactions
The human gene MUTYH encodes a DNA glycosylase involved in base excision repair, which interacts with several proteins to maintain genomic stability. MUTYH physically interacts with the mismatch repair protein human MutS homolog 6 (hMSH6) but not with human MutS homolog 2 (hMSH2). This interaction is crucial for MUTYH's role in DNA repair processes, as it enhances the binding and glycosylase activities of MUTYH when dealing with A/8-oxoG mismatches (Gu2002Human). The interaction between MUTYH and hMSH6 occurs within the hMSH2/hMSH6 heterodimer, and the region of MUTYH involved in this interaction is mapped to residues 232–254 (Gu2002Human).

MUTYH also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. Both MUTYH and hMSH6 colocalize with PCNA at replication foci, suggesting a coordinated role in the long patch base excision repair pathway (Gu2002Human). These interactions facilitate the coupling of base excision repair with DNA replication and mismatch repair, ensuring that repair pathways target daughter DNA strands (Gu2002Human).
