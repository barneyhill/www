# FFAR3

## Overview
The FFAR3 gene encodes the free fatty acid receptor 3, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. As a transmembrane receptor, FFAR3 is primarily activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are products of dietary fiber fermentation in the gut. This receptor is involved in energy homeostasis, immune response modulation, and metabolic regulation, influencing processes such as insulin secretion, glucose metabolism, and gut hormone synthesis. FFAR3 is expressed in several tissues, including pancreatic β cells and enteroendocrine cells, where it contributes to the regulation of hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). The receptor's signaling pathways involve interactions with various proteins, including Gi/o proteins and regulators of G-protein signaling, which modulate its effects on cellular functions. Alterations in FFAR3 expression and function have been linked to metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory conditions, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Kimura2020Free; Mishra2020Free; Solas2022The).

## Structure
The human FFAR3 protein is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) composed of 346 amino acids. Its structure is modeled based on the crystal structure of the human β2-adrenergic receptor, as the exact 3D structure of FFAR3 is not fully determined (Mishra2020Free; Bartoszek2020Free). FFAR3 features seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic of GPCRs, and includes a Glu-Arg-Phe motif in the third transmembrane domain, which is typical of the GPCR family class A (Kimura2020Free; Mishra2020Free).

The receptor's ligand-binding involves specific amino acid residues such as Phe 96, Tyr 151, and Leu 171, with Leu 171 playing a role in stabilizing negatively charged arginine residues at the second extracellular loop (Mishra2020Free). FFAR3 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its signaling capabilities (Kimura2020Free).

FFAR3 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Kimura2020Free). The receptor is involved in sensing short-chain fatty acids and is implicated in various physiological processes (Mishra2020Free).

## Function
FFAR3, or free fatty acid receptor 3, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. It plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, immune response, and metabolic regulation. In healthy human cells, FFAR3 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. It is expressed in pancreatic β cells, where it mediates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through a G i/o-dependent pathway, suggesting its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Kimura2020Free).

FFAR3 also influences gut hormone synthesis, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), which are crucial for appetite regulation and glucose metabolism. In FFAR3 knockout mice, levels of these hormones are significantly reduced, highlighting the receptor's role in their regulation (Mishra2020Free). Additionally, FFAR3 is expressed in enteroendocrine cells in the gut, where it contributes to the secretion of GLP-1 and PYY, affecting gut motility and energy balance (Kimura2020Free).

FFAR3 is also involved in immune modulation, where its activation by SCFAs can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance anti-inflammatory responses, impacting conditions like asthma and atherosclerosis (Mishra2020Free).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the FFAR3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), FFAR3 expression is increased in the early stages, suggesting a role in disease onset and progression. Studies using transgenic mouse models have shown that FFAR3 ablation can lead to cognitive improvement and reduced amyloid-beta plaque burden, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for AD (Zamarbide2022Genetic; Solas2022The).

FFAR3 is also involved in metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It plays a role in energy balance and glucose homeostasis, with its expression linked to insulin sensitivity. However, FFAR3 knockout mice have shown conflicting results regarding its impact on adiposity and glucose tolerance, suggesting a complex role in metabolic regulation (Mishra2020Free; Solas2022The).

In inflammatory conditions, FFAR3 influences immune responses and inflammation regulation. Its signaling can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance anti-inflammatory chemokines, impacting conditions like asthma and potentially reducing allergic inflammation (Mishra2020Free). FFAR3's involvement in these diverse conditions highlights its significance in both metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
FFAR3, also known as GPR41, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins to mediate its signaling functions. One of the key interactions involves the Gi/o protein-derived free Gβγ subunit, which activates phospholipase Cβ2/3 (PLCβ2/3). This activation leads to calcium signaling and the subsequent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, facilitating norepinephrine release from sympathetic neurons (Carbone2022Regulator; Nagliya2024Differential).

FFAR3 also interacts with the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4), which can bind to Gα subunits and Gi/o-derived free Gβγ subunits. This binding inhibits PLCβ activation, thereby reducing FFAR3 signaling towards norepinephrine release. RGS4 is activated by β-adrenergic receptors through PKA-dependent phosphorylation, which blocks FFAR3 signaling, suggesting a regulatory feedback loop that helps preserve cardiac β-adrenergic receptor function (Carbone2022Regulator).

Additionally, FFAR3 is involved in modulating calcium signaling in human airway smooth muscle cells, where its activation by short-chain fatty acids potentiates acetylcholine-stimulated calcium increases and stress fiber formation, leading to enhanced contraction (Mizuta2020The).
