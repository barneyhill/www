# APLP2

## Overview
APLP2 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 2) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein, which is part of the amyloid precursor protein family. This protein is characterized by its large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail, and it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system (Coburger2014The). APLP2 is involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptic function, and transcriptional regulation, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Scheinfeld2002Processing; Shariati2013APLP2). The protein interacts with other members of the APP family and various synaptic proteins, suggesting a compensatory role in synaptic transmission (Kaden2009Subcellular; Fanutza2015APP). Clinically, alterations in APLP2 expression have been associated with ocular conditions such as congenital stationary night blindness and refractive errors, underscoring its significance in retinal development and function (Dinet2016Amyloid; Tkatchenko2015APLP2).

## Structure
APLP2 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 2) is a member of the amyloid precursor protein family, sharing structural similarities with APP and APLP1. The protein is a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Coburger2014The). The E2 domain of APLP2, consisting of 204 amino acids with a molecular mass of 24.2 kDa, is primarily composed of alpha-helices and adopts a Spectrin repeat-like fold. It includes two coiled coil substructures connected by a continuous helix (Roisman2019The). The E2 domain forms an antiparallel dimer with a unique mode of dimerization compared to its paralogues, APP and APLP1 (Roisman2019The).

APLP2 contains conserved domains such as E1 and E2, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The E1 domain includes a growth factor-like domain (GFLD) and a copper-binding domain (CuBD), which are involved in heparin-dependent dimerization and metal ion sensing (Coburger2014The). APLP2 undergoes post-translational modifications like glycosylation and phosphorylation, contributing to its functional diversity (Coburger2014The). Multiple splice variants of APLP2 exist, further enhancing its functional versatility (Coburger2014The).

## Function
APLP2 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 2) is a transmembrane protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the brain. It plays a significant role in neuronal stem cell differentiation during cortical development by regulating progenitor proliferation and the timing of cell cycle exit, which is essential for determining the laminar fate of neurons (Shariati2013APLP2). APLP2 influences the decision between progenitor proliferation and differentiation into neurons through its involvement in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (Shariati2013APLP2).

The protein is processed similarly to other members of the APP family, with its N-terminal ectodomain released by a shedding enzyme. This process is crucial for normal development and survival, as demonstrated by knockout experiments in mice (Endres2005Shedding). APLP2 is also a substrate for disintegrin-metalloproteinases ADAM10 and TACE, which stimulate the generation of a soluble neurotrophic fragment, enhancing neuronal differentiation and survival (Endres2005Shedding).

In addition to its role in neurogenesis, APLP2 is involved in transcriptional regulation. It undergoes processing by γ-secretase, releasing fragments that can activate transcription in an Fe65-dependent manner, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation (Scheinfeld2002Processing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the APLP2 gene have been linked to several ocular conditions. APLP2 plays a critical role in retinal development and function, and its deletion or dysfunction can lead to congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). In APLP2 knockout mice, there are significant structural and functional changes in the retina, particularly affecting the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells. This results in impaired retinal development and synaptopathy, which are characteristic of CSNB (Dinet2016Amyloid).

APLP2 is also associated with refractive errors, including myopia. Variants in the APLP2 gene, particularly in its promoter region, have been linked to the development of myopia in both children and adults. These genetic variations can influence the expression of APLP2 in the retina, affecting synaptic transmission and refractive development. APLP2 knockout mice exhibit significant hyperopia, indicating its role in refractive error development (Tkatchenko2015APLP2). The gene-environment interaction, such as time spent reading, further influences myopia development in individuals with specific APLP2 variants (Tkatchenko2015APLP2).

## Interactions
APLP2 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in cellular processes. It can form homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) family, such as APP and APLP1. These interactions have been confirmed through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis and co-immunoprecipitation, with APLP2 showing FRET efficiencies of 16% for homodimers, and 10.4% and 12.7% for heterodimers with APP and APLP1, respectively (Kaden2009Subcellular).

APLP2 also interacts with the presynaptic release machinery, including proteins like Vamp2, Syt2, and Syp, which are crucial for synaptic transmission at hippocampal synapses. This interaction suggests that APLP2 can compensate for the loss of APP function in synapses (Fanutza2015APP).

In the context of immune responses, APLP2 interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, particularly the mouse MHC class I molecules Kd and Ld. APLP2 shows a stronger association with Kd, influenced by the presence of human β2-microglobulin, which affects the conformation of the MHC class I heavy chain (Tuli2008Specificity).
