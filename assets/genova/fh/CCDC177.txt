# CCDC177

## Overview
The CCDC177 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 177, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC177 may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC177 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural properties imply potential involvement in intracellular signaling pathways or structural organization within the cell. Further research is needed to determine the precise role of CCDC177 in human health and disease, as well as its potential interactions with other cellular components.
