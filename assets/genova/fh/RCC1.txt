# RCC1

## Overview
The RCC1 gene encodes the regulator of chromosome condensation 1 protein, which is a critical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ran GTPase. This protein plays a pivotal role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran, thereby maintaining a high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus (Renault1998The; Hadjebi2008The). Structurally, RCC1 is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller formation, which is essential for its interaction with chromatin and other cellular components (Renault1998The). The protein's function is crucial for several cellular processes, including mitotic spindle assembly, nuclear envelope formation, and spindle checkpoint regulation during mitosis (Hadjebi2008The). Mutations and alterations in the RCC1 gene have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability (Ren2020The; Wu2021Integrative).

## Structure
The RCC1 protein is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, formed from internal repeats of 51-68 residues per blade. This structure is distinct from WD40 domain proteins, despite both forming similar propeller shapes. Each blade of the RCC1 propeller consists of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, and the structure exhibits pseudo-sevenfold symmetry (Renault1998The). The RCC1 protein's primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the RCC1 gene, with several conserved residues forming a VYxWG fingerprint motif (Renault1998The).

RCC1 interacts with chromatin through its N-terminal tail, which contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a chromatin-binding domain. This tail undergoes post-translational modifications such as methylation and phosphorylation, which influence its interaction with chromatin and importin α3 (Sankhala2017Threedimensional). The protein has several splice variant isoforms, including α, β, and γ, which may differ in their regulatory roles and interactions with importin α isoforms (Sankhala2017Threedimensional).

The RCC1 protein functions as a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for the Ran GTPase, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly (Renault1998The).

## Function
The RCC1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Ran. In healthy human cells, RCC1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in nucleocytoplasmic transport by maintaining a high concentration of RanGTP. This is achieved through its interaction with chromatin and core histones H2A and H2B, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran (Li2004Phosphorylation; Hadjebi2008The).

RCC1 is essential for several cellular processes, including mitotic spindle assembly, nuclear envelope formation, and spindle checkpoint regulation during mitosis. During cell division, RCC1 binds to mitotic chromosomes, creating a RanGTP gradient that is crucial for spindle assembly and nuclear envelope reassembly (Li2004Phosphorylation; Hadjebi2008The). Phosphorylation of RCC1 during mitosis enhances its binding to chromatin, increasing its GEF activity and ensuring high RanGTP production, which is necessary for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation (Li2004Phosphorylation).

RCC1's role in regulating the cell cycle is underscored by its involvement in preventing premature mitosis, ensuring that DNA replication is complete before mitotic entry (Nishitani1991Loss; Dasso1992RCC1). This regulatory function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RCC1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. RCC1 is involved in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability, and its dysfunction can lead to tumorigenesis. Mutations in RCC1, such as hypermethylation, have been observed in gastric tumors, leading to gene silencing and contributing to tumor differentiation and invasion (Ren2020The). In familial breast cancer, a novel frameshift mutation in RCC1 has been identified, suggesting its role as a breast cancer susceptibility gene, particularly in the Tunisian population (Riahi2018Exome).

RCC1 expression levels vary across different tumor types, with high expression linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as breast cancer and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Conversely, high expression is associated with better outcomes in colorectal and stomach adenocarcinomas, indicating a complex role in cancer progression (Wu2021Integrative). RCC1 is also implicated in immune evasion mechanisms, interacting with immune checkpoint genes and influencing tumor microenvironment dynamics, which may affect responses to immunotherapy (Wu2021Integrative). These findings highlight RCC1's potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RCC1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ran GTPase, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran, which is essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly (Renault1998The). RCC1 binds to chromatin through its N-terminal region, and this interaction is stabilized by Ran, which is crucial for establishing a RanGTP gradient necessary for various cell cycle processes (Ren2020The).

RCC1 interacts with importin α3, which mediates its nuclear import. Importin α3 binds RCC1 with higher affinity than importin α1 due to its conformational flexibility, allowing it to accommodate the RCC1 β-propeller domain (Sankhala2017Threedimensional). This interaction involves burying a significant portion of RCC1's surface and is mediated through specific residues, with the minor NLS box of RCC1 playing a significant role (Sankhala2017Threedimensional).

RCC1 also interacts with the nucleosome core particle, specifically binding to nucleosomal DNA and histone H2A. This interaction involves the DNA-binding loop of RCC1 and is crucial for its function in chromatin condensation (Makde2010Structure). These interactions highlight RCC1's role in regulating chromatin dynamics and its involvement in critical cellular functions.
