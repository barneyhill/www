# GABRE

## Overview
The GABRE gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit epsilon, a component of the GABA A receptor, which is a member of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. This receptor is integral to inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals by facilitating chloride ion influx into neurons, thereby reducing neuronal excitability. The epsilon subunit contributes to the structural and functional diversity of GABA A receptors, influencing receptor pharmacology and kinetics, which are crucial for synaptic transmission and neural network modulation (AlvesFerreira2021A; Fernandez2008Investigation). The GABRE gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and lungs, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in normal and pathological states (Fatemi2013Expression).

## Structure
The GABRE gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the GABA A receptor, which is part of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. These channels are pentameric, consisting of five subunits that form a central pore. Each subunit, including the epsilon subunit, has a conserved extracellular NH2-terminal domain, three transmembrane domains, a cytoplasmic loop, and a fourth transmembrane domain followed by a COOH-terminal sequence. The transmembrane domains are alpha-helices, with TM2 lining the pore and TM4 interacting with the lipid bilayer. The extracellular domain forms a beta-barrel structure, and the Cys-loop is a conserved feature in the first extracellular domain (Mullins2010Fine).

The human epsilon subunit is composed of 632 amino acids and shares 56% amino acid identity with the chick β4 subunit in extracellular and transmembrane domains. It shows significant structural variation between species, with rodent epsilon subunits having a large insertion near the N terminus that is not present in humans (Sinkkonen2000GABAAReceptor). The epsilon subunit is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the locus ceruleus (Sinkkonen2000GABAAReceptor).

## Function
The GABRE gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain by allowing chloride ions to enter neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability (AlvesFerreira2021A; Fernandez2008Investigation).

The epsilon subunit, encoded by GABRE, contributes to the structural diversity of GABA A receptors, which are pentameric structures composed of various subunits. This diversity is important for modulating receptor pharmacology and kinetics, thereby influencing synaptic transmission and neural network activity (Fernandez2008Investigation). The full-length variant of the GABRE gene is highly expressed in the heart and lung and is also present in the brain, indicating its involvement in normal inhibitory neurotransmission in these tissues (Fernandez2008Investigation).

In healthy human cells, the GABRE gene's role in the regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission is essential for normal brain function, and disruptions in this balance are implicated in various neurological conditions (AlvesFerreira2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GABRE gene, which encodes the epsilon subunit of the GABA-A receptor, have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders. Studies have shown that the expression of GABRE is significantly increased in the lateral cerebellum of individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. This altered expression may contribute to improper GABAergic transmission, potentially leading to dysregulated states of anxiety, panic, and deficits in learning (Fatemi2013Expression). The increased expression of GABRE in these conditions suggests a potential role in the pathophysiology of these disorders, although the exact clinical significance requires further investigation (Fatemi2013Expression).

In the context of migraine, the GABRE gene has been studied for its potential association with migraine susceptibility. While one study found no direct association between GABRE polymorphisms and migraine, another study identified a significant synergistic interaction between GABRE and the NRXN2 gene in females, suggesting a complex genetic interplay in migraine predisposition (AlvesFerreira2021A; Fernandez2008Investigation). These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the clinical implications of GABRE in neurological and psychiatric conditions.
