# CLUAP1

## Overview
CLUAP1, or clusterin associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is essential for cellular signaling and movement. The CLUAP1 protein is characterized by its N-terminal calponin homology-like domain and C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions with other IFT proteins such as IFT20, IFT57, and IFT80, forming a peripheral subcomplex crucial for the stability and function of the IFT-B complex (Katoh2016Overall). Beyond its role in ciliogenesis, CLUAP1 is involved in cytoskeletal organization and intracellular transport, impacting cell migration and dynamics (Beyer2018CRISPRCas9mediated). Mutations in the CLUAP1 gene are linked to ciliopathies, including Leber congenital amaurosis and Joubert syndrome, as well as being implicated in cancer pathogenesis, underscoring its clinical significance (Soens2016Hypomorphic; Takahashi2004Isolation).

## Structure
The CLUAP1 gene encodes a protein with two isoforms expressed in the human retina: a long isoform consisting of 413 amino acids and a short isoform of 247 amino acids (Soens2016Hypomorphic). The protein contains two major domains: an N-terminal calponin homology-like domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. These domains are highly conserved from zebrafish to humans and are similar to those found in many microtubule-binding proteins (Soens2016Hypomorphic). The coiled-coil domain is associated with microtubule binding activity and facilitating protein-protein interactions (Soens2016Hypomorphic).

CLUAP1 is part of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, specifically within the peripheral subcomplex, where it interacts with other IFT proteins such as IFT20 and IFT80. These interactions are mediated by specific domains, with the N-terminal NN-CH domain of CLUAP1 interacting with the WD40 domain of IFT80, and the coiled-coil region interacting with IFT20 (Katoh2016Overall). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with IFT57, acting as a linker to the IFT-B1 complex (Beyer2018CRISPRCas9mediated). A mutation in the coiled-coil domain, resulting in a leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution, is predicted to be damaging and affects both isoforms (Soens2016Hypomorphic).

## Function
CLUAP1, also known as clusterin associated protein 1, is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex, which is essential for ciliogenesis. This protein is involved in the assembly and maintenance of cilia, cellular organelles that play a significant role in signal transduction and cellular movement. CLUAP1 is active in the cytoplasm and localizes to the base and tip of cilia, where it participates in the IFT cycle, facilitating the transport of molecular components necessary for cilium formation and function (Pasek2012Mammalian; Botilde2013Cluap1).

In healthy human cells, CLUAP1 is part of the IFT-B subcomplex, where it interacts with other IFT proteins such as IFT20, IFT57, and IFT80, forming a peripheral subcomplex crucial for the stability and function of the IFT-B complex (Katoh2016Overall). The protein's role extends beyond ciliogenesis, as it is also implicated in cytoskeletal arrangement and intracellular transport processes, affecting cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics (Beyer2018CRISPRCas9mediated). The absence of CLUAP1 leads to defects in cilia formation, resulting in developmental abnormalities and diseases known as ciliopathies (Pasek2012Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLUAP1 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, which are disorders arising from ciliary dysfunction. One such condition is Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe retinal dystrophy characterized by early-onset visual impairment. A homozygous nonsynonymous mutation in CLUAP1 has been linked to LCA, leading to photoreceptor cell death without systemic abnormalities (Soens2016Hypomorphic). 

CLUAP1 mutations are also implicated in a range of developmental disorders, including Joubert syndrome, oral–facial–digital syndrome, and Pallister-Hall syndrome. These conditions are characterized by limb, central nervous system, and craniofacial anomalies. The mutations disrupt the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, crucial for ciliary function, leading to these syndromic features (Johnston2017Compound).

In addition to its role in ciliopathies, CLUAP1 is frequently upregulated in colon cancer, suggesting a role in cancer pathogenesis. Its expression is associated with cell cycle regulation, and suppression of CLUAP1 can lead to growth retardation in cancer cells (Takahashi2004Isolation). The gene's involvement in both ciliopathies and cancer highlights its clinical significance in various human diseases.

## Interactions
CLUAP1, also known as IFT38, is a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex, specifically within the peripheral subcomplex. It interacts with several proteins, including IFT20, IFT57, IFT80, and IFT172, forming a stable subcomplex essential for ciliary assembly and maintenance (Katoh2016Overall). CLUAP1 connects IFT20 to IFT80, facilitating the formation of a hexapartite complex among the IFT-B peripheral subunits (Katoh2016Overall). It can form homodimers or heterodimers with IFT57, acting as a linker to the IFT-B1 complex through interactions with IFT88/IFT52 and other IFT-B2 components (Taschner2016Intraflagellar; Beyer2018CRISPRCas9mediated).

CLUAP1's interactions are mediated by specific domains, such as the N-terminal NN-CH domain for IFT80 and the coiled-coil region for IFT20 (Katoh2016Overall). These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for ciliary function (Katoh2016Overall). In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, CLUAP1 is involved in cytoskeletal organization, interacting with proteins like Ephrin-B1 and TRIP6, which are associated with cytoskeletal arrangement and protein transport (Beyer2018CRISPRCas9mediated).
