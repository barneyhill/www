# CALHM6

## Overview
CALHM6 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium homeostasis modulator family member 6, which is part of the calcium homeostasis modulator family. This protein is characterized as a large-pore channel with a unique structural configuration, including four transmembrane helices and a C-terminal helix that contributes to its oligomeric assembly. CALHM6 primarily forms decameric and undecameric channels, which are distinct in their conical pore conformation. Functionally, the protein plays a significant role in calcium signaling and homeostasis, particularly in the context of immune cell activation and antiviral responses. It is involved in modulating cytosolic calcium levels, which are crucial for the production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent activation of antiviral genes. CALHM6 is expressed in various tissues, including the human placenta, and its expression is implicated in several clinical conditions, such as steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome and hepatitis B virus infection, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for disease progression (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Cason2023Genetic; Jabeen2021Effect).

## Structure
CALHM6 is a member of the calcium homeostasis modulator family, characterized by its large-pore channel structure. The protein is composed of four transmembrane helices (TM1-4), with TM1 extending from the cytoplasm towards the extracellular side and facing the central pore. The C-terminal helix (CTH) follows TM4 and interacts with adjacent protomers, forming an arrangement resembling overlapping blades (Syrjanen2021On). The N-terminal helix (NTH) is involved in voltage-dependent gating, although its structure is less resolved than TM2-4 (Syrjanen2021On).

CALHM6 forms oligomeric assemblies, predominantly as decamers and undecamers, with a conical pore conformation distinct from the cylindrical pore of its paralog, CALHM4 (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). The oligomeric state of CALHM6 affects its pore size and is influenced by the position of a proline residue in the TM4-CTH loop, which introduces a kink (Syrjanen2021On). The protein's quaternary structure is characterized by a large multimeric assembly, with the C-terminal region engaging in intramolecular interactions with the cytoplasmic rim (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM).

The structural flexibility of CALHM6, particularly in TM1, allows for a funnel-like structure that narrows towards the intracellular side, contributing to its unique pore geometry (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). The protein's structure is determined using cryo-electron microscopy, with a resolution of 4.5 Å, allowing for the placement of helices and conserved loop regions (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM).

## Function
CALHM6, also known as Calcium homeostasis modulator protein 6, is involved in calcium signaling and homeostasis, playing a crucial role in modulating innate immunity. It is functionally related to calcium-binding proteins and is regulated by disturbances in cytosolic calcium levels. CALHM6 is implicated in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, which is essential for immune cell activation. This process involves increasing cytosolic calcium levels through extracellular influx and release from intracellular stores, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production facilitates the activation of antiviral genes through RIG-I-mediated IRF-3 activation (Jabeen2021Effect).

Structurally, CALHM6 forms large multimeric assemblies, specifically decameric and undecameric channels, which are distinct from other CALHM family members. These channels are characterized by large pore sizes, which could lead to high conductance, although their low open probability suggests a regulatory mechanism to prevent leakage (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). CALHM6 channels are expressed in the human placenta, where they are thought to play a significant role in mediating transport processes during fetal development (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). Despite its structural similarities to other membrane proteins, CALHM6 does not exhibit pronounced activity under conditions that activate other CALHM channels, indicating it may be regulated by unknown mechanisms (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM).

## Clinical Significance
The CALHM6 gene, also known as FAM26F, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS), CALHM6 is associated with immune regulation. Variants in CALHM6 are strong expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for the gene, with risk alleles decreasing its expression. This downregulation may lead to an imbalance in CD4+ T helper cell subgroups, contributing to SSNS pathogenesis (DufekKamperis2020Novel; Horinouchi2022An). The gene's expression is also linked to the response to corticosteroid therapy in childhood nephrotic syndrome, with significant differences in allele frequency between steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant forms (Cason2023Genetic).

In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, CALHM6 expression is significantly downregulated, which may be part of the virus's strategy to evade the host immune system. This downregulation is associated with oxidative stress and calcium deregulation, and treatments targeting these pathways can restore CALHM6 expression (Jabeen2021Effect). These findings suggest that CALHM6 could serve as a marker for disease progression and recovery in HBV-infected patients.

## Interactions
CALHM6, a member of the calcium homeostasis modulator family, exhibits limited interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. Structural studies have shown that CALHM6 forms large oligomeric assemblies, typically containing between 10 and 12 subunits, but it does not significantly interact with other CALHM family members such as CALHM2 and CALHM4 (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM; Drożdżyk2024Structural). Unlike CALHM4, which shows a tendency to dimerize, CALHM6 channels do not interact significantly with each other, indicating a preference for forming homomeric rather than heteromeric assemblies (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM).

The structural analysis of CALHM6 has not revealed significant interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, nor have any activating or inhibitory interactions been identified (Drożdżyk2020CryoEM). Although CALHM6 may form gap junction channel-like assemblies, the physiological relevance of these structures remains to be validated (Syrjanen2021On). The potential for CALHM6 to participate in complex structural assemblies suggests it may influence cellular processes, but specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Syrjanen2021On).
