# NPPA

## Overview
The NPPA gene encodes the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a critical hormone involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. ANP is a member of the natriuretic peptide family, which functions primarily as a vasodilator and regulator of blood pressure and fluid balance. Synthesized as a precursor molecule, ANP undergoes specific cleavage processes to become active, exerting its effects through the type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPRA) by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in target cells. This signaling cascade facilitates various physiological responses, including increased renal sodium excretion, vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beyond its cardiovascular roles, ANP is implicated in energy metabolism, influencing processes such as lipolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Genetic variations in NPPA can lead to altered ANP function and are associated with conditions like atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular disease (Rubattu2020Epigenetic; Song2015Atrial).

## Structure
The NPPA gene encodes the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is initially synthesized as a 151-amino-acid precursor known as prepro-ANP (Roberts2010Evaluation; Song2015Atrial). This precursor undergoes cleavage to remove a 25-amino-acid signal peptide, resulting in a 126-amino-acid pro-ANP (Song2015Atrial). The active form of ANP is a 28-amino-acid peptide, which is generated by the cleavage of pro-ANP at Arg-98↓Ser-99 by the serine protease corin (Song2015Atrial). 

The tertiary structure of ANP includes a ring structure stabilized by a disulfide bond between cysteines, contributing to its functional conformation (Koller1992Molecular). ANP functions as a monomer, indicating the absence of a quaternary structure. Common post-translational modifications of ANP include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its stability and activity (Song2015Atrial).

Variants in the NPPA gene can lead to different isoforms, such as a frameshift mutation resulting in a mutant ANP with an additional 12 amino acids, which is more resistant to degradation and has enhanced biological activity (Song2015Atrial; Menon2019Electrophysiologic).

## Function
The NPPA gene encodes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a hormone primarily produced by atrial myocytes in response to volume or pressure overload. ANP plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis by promoting vasodilation, increasing renal sodium and water excretion, and inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These actions help regulate blood pressure and fluid balance in the body (Rubattu2020Epigenetic; Song2015Atrial).

ANP exerts its effects through the type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPRA), which, upon activation, increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in target cells. This signaling pathway leads to increased glomerular filtration rate, inhibition of sodium and water reabsorption, and suppression of renin secretion (Song2015Atrial). ANP also has anti-proliferative effects on cardiac, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells, contributing to vascular remodeling and preventing hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes (Rubattu2020Epigenetic; Song2015Atrial).

In addition to its cardiovascular functions, ANP is involved in energy metabolism by promoting lipolysis, enhancing mitochondrial respiration, and stimulating fat oxidation, which may help prevent metabolic diseases (Song2015Atrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPPA gene, which encodes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. Variants in NPPA are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia. A frameshift mutation in NPPA has been linked to familial AF, leading to increased levels of mutant ANP, which may cause electrophysiological changes that predispose individuals to AF (HodgsonZingman2008Atrial; Menon2019Electrophysiologic). The p.Ile138Thr variant is another mutation associated with AF, promoting inflammation and cardiac fibrosis through pathways like TNF-a and NF-kB, contributing to the arrhythmia (Cheng2019Mutation).

Alterations in NPPA expression levels also impact cardiovascular health. Overexpression of NPPA can lower blood pressure, while reduced expression or knockout models lead to hypertension and increased cardiac mass (Rubattu2014Atrial). Epigenetic modifications, such as increased DNA methylation of the NPPA promoter, have been observed in conditions like smoking withdrawal and eating disorders, potentially affecting cardiovascular function (Rubattu2020Epigenetic). These genetic and epigenetic changes underscore the role of NPPA in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The NPPA gene encodes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cardiovascular regulation. ANP interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in cardiomyocytes, a process influenced by 17β-estradiol (E2). This interaction is mediated by the LXXLL motif in NPPA, which is crucial for binding to the EF domain of ERα. The interaction leads to the nuclear translocation and co-localization of NPPA and ERα, affecting gene expression in cardiomyocytes (Mahmoodzadeh201217βEstradiolinduced).

ANP also binds to natriuretic peptide receptors, particularly NPR-A and NPR-C. Binding to NPR-A activates guanylyl cyclase, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, which is essential for its physiological effects such as natriuresis, diuresis, and vasorelaxation. NPR-C, on the other hand, mediates the clearance of ANP, regulating its plasma concentration (Potter2009Natriuretic).

A frameshift mutation in NPPA has been linked to familial atrial fibrillation, affecting the expression and function of cardiac ion channels. This mutation alters the interaction of ANP with ion channels, leading to changes in sodium, calcium, and potassium currents, contributing to the electrophysiologic substrate for atrial fibrillation (Menon2019Electrophysiologic).
