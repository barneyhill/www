# HSD17B1

## Overview
HSD17B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 1, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in steroid metabolism, particularly in the conversion of estrone to the more potent estradiol, thereby influencing estrogen balance in the body (Heinosalo2019Role; He2016Current). Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 1 is characterized by its homodimeric structure and a Rossmann fold, which is essential for its interaction with the cofactor NADPH (Mindnich2004The; He2016Current). The enzyme is predominantly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and the placenta, where it is integral to estrogen biosynthesis, impacting reproductive functions and pregnancy maintenance (Yazawa2023Comparison; Heinosalo2019Role). Its activity is also significant in peripheral tissues, where it regulates estrogen levels, affecting various physiological processes (Heinosalo2019Role). The clinical significance of HSD17B1 is underscored by its involvement in several diseases, including endometrial and breast cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Heinosalo2019Role).

## Structure
The human HSD17B1 gene encodes the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, which plays a crucial role in steroid metabolism. The enzyme consists of 327 amino acids and forms a homodimer with two identical subunits, each weighing approximately 34.5 kDa (He2016Current). The primary structure of the enzyme includes a sequence of amino acids that contribute to its function in steroid conversion.

The secondary structure of 17β-HSD1 features a Rossmann fold, a common motif for nucleotide binding, which is essential for its interaction with cofactors like NADPH (He2016Current). This fold is characterized by a positively charged amino acid forming a salt bridge with the cofactor NADP(H), facilitating the enzyme's catalytic activity.

In terms of tertiary structure, the enzyme has a rigid cofactor binding site and a narrow, hydrophobic substrate recognition domain, which are critical for its specificity and function (He2016Current). The quaternary structure is represented by its homodimeric form, which is typical for enzymes in the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family (Mindnich2004The).

The enzyme's ability to bind C-19 steroids in different orientations allows it to perform 3β-reduction and 17β-oxidation, contributing to its multifunctional role in steroid metabolism (He2016Current).

## Function
The human gene HSD17B1 encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid (17beta) dehydrogenase 1, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of sex steroids, particularly in the conversion of estrone (E1) to the more potent estrogen, estradiol (E2) (Heinosalo2019Role; He2016Current). This conversion is significant for maintaining the balance of estrogens in the body, impacting various physiological processes, including reproductive functions (Heinosalo2019Role). The enzyme is highly specific for the cofactor NADPH, which drives the reaction predominantly in the reductive direction under normal cellular conditions (Heinosalo2019Role).

HSD17B1 is primarily expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and the placenta, where it is involved in estrogen biosynthesis (Yazawa2023Comparison; Heinosalo2019Role). In the ovaries, it is expressed in granulosa cells, which are responsible for converting androgens synthesized by theca cells into estrogens, a process crucial for follicular development and differentiation (Heinosalo2019Role). In the placenta, the enzyme is expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells, contributing to estrogen production necessary for maintaining pregnancy (Heinosalo2019Role).

The enzyme's activity is also linked to the regulation of estrogen levels in peripheral tissues, influencing various physiological outcomes, including the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive health (Heinosalo2019Role).

## Clinical Significance
The HSD17B1 gene is clinically significant due to its role in various diseases and conditions, particularly those involving steroid-dependent tissues. In endometrial cancer, increased levels of HSD17B1 enhance estrogen production, promoting tumor growth and predicting poor prognosis (Heinosalo2019Role). In breast cancer, HSD17B1 is crucial for the progression of estrogen receptor-positive cancers, with low HSD17B2/HSD17B1 ratios linked to high recurrence rates and poor response to tamoxifen therapy (Heinosalo2019Role). The gene's expression is also noted in other reproductive disorders, such as increased levels in tubal pregnancy and cervical cancer, and reduced levels in preeclampsia (Heinosalo2019Role).

Beyond reproductive tissues, HSD17B1 is expressed in various organs, including the lungs and stomach, where increased expression is associated with poor prognosis in lung and gastric cancers (Heinosalo2019Role). In bladder cancer, elevated HSD17B1 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and reduced overall survival rates (Albadawy2024Identification). Genetic polymorphisms, such as Ser312Gly, have been associated with cancer risk, although they do not affect the enzyme's estrogenic activity (Shi2016Polymorphism). Overall, alterations in HSD17B1 expression are typically linked to poor prognosis in both hormone-dependent and less hormone-dependent diseases (Heinosalo2019Role).
