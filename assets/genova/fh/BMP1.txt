# BMP1

## Overview
Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) is a protein encoded by the BMP1 gene, which is part of the astacin family of metalloproteases. Unlike other bone morphogenetic proteins, BMP1 does not belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. Instead, it functions primarily as a procollagen C-proteinase, playing a pivotal role in the biosynthesis and maturation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by processing precursors of major fibrillar collagens. BMP1 is involved in the activation of growth factors and the remodeling of the ECM, which are crucial for various physiological processes, including development and wound repair. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as CUB and EGF-like domains, which regulate its activity and substrate specificity. Mutations in the BMP1 gene can lead to disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its significance in bone biology and ECM integrity (Muir2016BMP1like; Anastasi2020BMP1; Asharani2012Attenuated).

## Structure
Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) is a metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in the formation of the extracellular matrix. The protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. BMP1 contains a signal peptide and a propeptide, which are involved in its secretion and activation. The mature enzyme features a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, essential for its proteolytic activity (N’Diaye2021Extracellular; Anastasi2020BMP1).

BMP1 also includes three CUB (complement, uEGF, BMP-1) domains and one EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like domain. These non-catalytic domains are significant for the enzyme's function, as they regulate substrate access to the active site and influence substrate specificity (N’Diaye2021Extracellular; Anastasi2020BMP1). The CUB domains, in particular, are involved in interactions with inhibitors such as PCPE-2, which binds to BMP1 through an allosteric mechanism (VadonLe2023Identification).

BMP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may affect its stability and activity. The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, such as BMP-1-1 and BMP-1-3, which may have distinct functional roles (VadonLe2023Identification). The structural flexibility of BMP1, particularly in its vicinal disulphide-bridge region, is important for its interaction with inhibitors (Sharma2022Insights).

## Function
The BMP1 gene encodes bone morphogenetic protein 1, a metalloproteinase that plays a crucial role in the biosynthetic processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. In healthy human cells, BMP1 functions primarily as a procollagen C-proteinase, responsible for cleaving C-propeptides from procollagen precursors of major fibrillar collagens I-III. This cleavage is essential for producing mature collagen monomers, which are necessary for the structural integrity of tissues such as bone and skin (Muir2016BMP1like; Muir2014Induced).

BMP1 is also involved in the activation of growth factors, including members of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, by cleaving latent TGFβ-binding proteins. This activation is important for ECM remodeling and influences various physiological processes such as development and wound repair (Ge2006BMP1; VadonLe2015BMP1tolloidlike). BMP1's activity is regulated by its non-catalytic domains, which confer substrate specificity, and it is active in the extracellular space (VadonLe2015BMP1tolloidlike).

Mutations in BMP1 can lead to impaired collagen processing, resulting in conditions such as bone fragility due to defective collagen fibril formation (Asharani2012Attenuated). The gene is co-expressed with Tll1 in various tissues, suggesting overlapping functions that contribute to bone biology (Muir2014Induced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BMP1 gene are associated with several bone-related disorders, most notably osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a condition characterized by brittle bones and increased fracture risk. While classic OI is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner due to mutations in type I collagen genes, rare autosomal recessive forms have been linked to BMP1 mutations. These mutations affect the gene's role in collagen processing, leading to compromised bone integrity (MartínezGlez2011Identification; Wang2014Bone).

Specific mutations, such as the homozygous F249L missense mutation in the protease domain of BMP1, have been identified in patients with severe autosomal recessive OI. This mutation impairs the proteolytic activity necessary for proper collagen processing, resulting in deficient bone formation (MartínezGlez2011Identification). Another mutation, G12R, affects the signal peptide of BMP1, disrupting protein secretion and leading to similar bone fragility (Asharani2012Attenuated).

In some cases, BMP1 mutations are associated with a high bone mass phenotype, which is atypical for OI. Patients with these mutations may exhibit high bone mineral density but still experience fractures and skeletal abnormalities, indicating that BMP1 plays a complex role in bone density regulation (Campanini2021High).

## Interactions
Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in the maturation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and the activation of growth factors. BMP1 interacts with latent TGFβ-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), cleaving it at specific sites to facilitate the activation of TGFβ1. This interaction is essential for liberating the large latent complex (LLC) from the ECM, making it susceptible to further cleavage by metalloproteinases like MMP2, which ultimately activates TGFβ1 (Ge2006BMP1).

BMP1 also cleaves thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), disrupting its interaction with cellular receptors and affecting cell adhesion. This cleavage enhances TGF-β activation by facilitating the release of TGF-β from its latent complex, thereby increasing its availability for signaling (Anastasi2020BMP1).

In addition, BMP1 interacts with procollagen C-proteinase enhancers (PCPEs), which enhance its activity in cleaving procollagens, crucial for fibril formation. BMP1 also interacts with periostin to promote the activation of lysyl oxidase, affecting collagen fibrillogenesis (VadonLe2015BMP1tolloidlike). These interactions highlight BMP1's role in coordinating ECM assembly and growth factor activation.
