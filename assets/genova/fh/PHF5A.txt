# PHF5A

## Overview
PHF5A is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 5A, a highly conserved protein involved in crucial cellular processes, particularly pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is a component of the spliceosome, specifically the U2 snRNP complex, where it plays a pivotal role in recognizing and excising introns from pre-mRNA. PHF5A is characterized by its unique trefoil knot topology and functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with other splicing factors such as SF3B1, SF3B3, and SF3B5. Beyond its role in splicing, PHF5A is implicated in alternative splicing regulation and has spliceosome-independent functions, including stabilizing transcriptional and histone chaperone complexes. These activities are essential for maintaining cellular processes like cell cycle progression and differentiation. Clinically, PHF5A is associated with the progression of various cancers, where its altered expression levels serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (Teng2017Splicing; Song2023The; Zhang2023PHF5A).

## Structure
PHF5A is a protein characterized by a unique trefoil knot topology, which is conserved across diverse eukaryotic organisms (Teng2017Splicing). Despite being classified as a PHD finger, PHF5A has low sequence homology with other PHD fingers and deviates from the canonical fold, indicating a distinct structural role (Teng2017Splicing). The protein's structure includes a mushroom-like shape with a triangular cap and a stem, where the cap contains a trefoil knot coordinated by three zinc ions through CXXC motifs (Teng2017Splicing).

PHF5A forms a central scaffolding component within the spliceosome B act complex, interacting with SF3B1, SF3B3, SF3B5, U2 snRNA, and intron RNA (Teng2017Splicing). The SF3B1 HEAT repeats create a superhelical spiral cavity where PHF5A is nestled, forming extensive contacts (Teng2017Splicing). The PHF5A-SF3B1 interface is crucial for branch point adenosine binding, implicating PHF5A in branchpoint recognition (Teng2017Splicing).

Mutations in PHF5A, such as Y36C, can alter the protein's interaction with splicing modulators, affecting exon skipping and intron retention without disrupting the overall protein fold (Teng2017Splicing). These mutations highlight the importance of specific residues in modulator binding and splicing regulation (Teng2017Splicing).

## Function
PHF5A (PHD finger protein 5A) is a crucial component of the spliceosome, specifically part of the U2 snRNP complex, where it plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing by recognizing and removing introns. It forms the branch point pocket with SF3B1, which is essential for the splicing process (Teng2017Splicing; Song2023The). PHF5A acts as a scaffold protein, interacting with SF3B1, SF3B3, SF3B5, and intron pre-mRNA, facilitating branch point sequence recognition during splicing (Wang2019Acetylation; Yu2021SIRT7Induced).

In addition to its role in splicing, PHF5A is involved in alternative splicing regulation, which affects gene expression and protein diversity (Yu2021SIRT7Induced). It also has spliceosome-independent functions, such as stabilizing the Paf1 transcriptional complex, which is important for the self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, and stabilizing the p400 histone chaperone complex involved in DNA repair (Song2023The).

PHF5A is active in the nucleus and contributes to cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. Its proper function and regulation are essential for maintaining cellular processes like mitosis and microtubule organization (Song2023The).

## Clinical Significance
PHF5A (PHD finger protein 5A) is implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer, PHF5A is abundantly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with certain pathological characteristics, although it does not independently predict prognosis (Zhang2023PHF5A). In lung adenocarcinoma, PHF5A acts as an oncoprotein, with its overexpression linked to tumor progression, poor prognosis, and shorter overall survival. Knockdown of PHF5A in lung adenocarcinoma cells results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Yang2018PHDfinger; Mao2019PHD).

PHF5A is also upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with immune evasion and angiogenesis, influencing treatment responses (Cheng2024Comprehensive). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, high PHF5A expression correlates with poor survival and promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration (Liu2023PHF5A). Across various cancers, PHF5A expression is linked to tumor stages and grades, serving as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Ding2023PHF5A). These findings underscore PHF5A's significance in cancer development and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PHF5A is a highly conserved protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing by acting as a bridge between splicing factors and ATP-dependent helicases. It interacts with several proteins, including U2AF1, SFRS5, EP400, and DDX1. The N-terminal part of PHF5A is responsible for interacting with the RS domain of U2AF1, which contains zinc fingers likely forming a ring finger domain for protein-protein interactions. The third zinc finger of PHF5A is crucial for binding to helicases like DDX1 and EP400 (Rzymski2008PHF5A).

PHF5A is also part of a subcomplex with PHF14, HMG20A, and RAI1 in pancreatic cancer stem cells, where it regulates key functions necessary for stem cell maintenance. This subcomplex is involved in telomere maintenance and cellular stress response, with PHF14 identified as a significant nuclear binding partner of PHF5A (Mouti2023KMT2A).

In the context of splicing regulation, PHF5A interacts with small-molecule splicing modulators, acting as a competitive inhibitor at the branch point adenosine binding pocket. The Y36 residue of PHF5A is critical for the binding of these modulators, with mutations at this position significantly affecting binding affinity (Teng2017Splicing).
