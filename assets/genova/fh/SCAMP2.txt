# SCAMP2

## Overview
SCAMP2, or secretory carrier membrane protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in vesicular transport and membrane trafficking within cells. The SCAMP2 protein is integral to the processes of exocytosis and endocytosis, playing a pivotal role in neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion. It is predominantly localized in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, where it facilitates protein sorting and vesicle formation. Structurally, SCAMP2 is characterized by four transmembrane segments and a conserved TM2-TM3 loop, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE7. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating organellar pH and volume. Additionally, SCAMP2 modulates the trafficking of T-type calcium channels, impacting neuronal excitability and firing patterns (Lin2005Secretory; Cmarko2022Secretory; Yue2021SCAMP25).

## Structure
SCAMP2 is a member of the secretory carrier membrane protein family, characterized by its involvement in vesicular trafficking. The protein is composed of four transmembrane segments, which are flanked by cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal extensions (Lin2005Secretory; Cmarko2022Secretory). These transmembrane domains contribute to its integration into cellular membranes, particularly within the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes (Lin2005Secretory).

A key structural feature of SCAMP2 is the TM2-TM3 loop, a highly conserved cytoplasmic region crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE7 (Lin2005Secretory). This loop is sufficient for binding and targeting NHE7 to the trans-Golgi network, highlighting its importance in SCAMP2's function (Lin2005Secretory).

SCAMP2 also contains an E peptide within its cytoplasmic domain, which is essential for its regulatory functions, including modulating the cell surface expression of T-type calcium channels (Cmarko2022Secretory). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which could play a role in signal transduction and protein interactions (Lin2005Secretory).

## Function
SCAMP2 (secretory carrier membrane protein 2) is involved in the regulation of vesicular transport and membrane trafficking in cells. It plays a crucial role in exocytosis and endocytosis, processes essential for neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion. SCAMP2 is primarily active in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, facilitating protein sorting and vesicle formation (Yue2021SCAMP25).

In healthy human cells, SCAMP2 is involved in the trafficking and regulation of the Na+/K+/H+ exchanger NHE7. It interacts with NHE7 in the trans-Golgi network and post-Golgi vesicles, playing a role in the retrieval of NHE7 from recycling endosomes to the TGN. This interaction is crucial for maintaining organellar pH and volume homeostasis (Lin2005Secretory). The TM2-TM3 region of SCAMP2 is critical for binding to NHE7, and mutations in this region can disrupt normal trafficking, causing NHE7 to accumulate in peripheral endosomes (Lin2005Secretory).

SCAMP2 also regulates the trafficking of T-type calcium channels, specifically Ca v 3.2, at the plasma membrane. It reduces T-type current by decreasing Ca v 3.2 expression at the cell surface, which is important for neuronal excitability and shaping neuronal firing patterns (Cmarko2022Secretory).

## Clinical Significance
SCAMP2 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SCAMP2 is significantly overexpressed, and high mRNA levels are associated with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Yue2021SCAMP25). The gene's involvement in pathways related to tumorigenesis, such as mTOR and NF-kappa B signaling, further supports its role in cancer progression (Yue2021SCAMP25).

In exfoliation syndrome (XFS), a condition linked to secondary glaucoma, SCAMP2 shows decreased expression in affected tissues. This suggests a role in the pathogenesis of XFS, potentially through inflammatory processes (Hirbo2023Analysis). The gene's association with XFS was initially masked by the strong LOXL1 signal, but further analysis confirmed its involvement (Hirbo2023Analysis).

SCAMP2 also interacts with T-type calcium channels, affecting their trafficking and surface expression. This interaction is crucial for neuronal excitability, and disruptions could have implications in neurological conditions, although specific diseases have not been directly linked to SCAMP2 mutations (Cmarko2022Secretory).

## Interactions
SCAMP2 (secretory carrier membrane protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in vesicular transport and membrane trafficking. SCAMP2 interacts with the Na+/K+/H+ exchanger NHE7, primarily through its TM2-TM3 loop, which binds to the C-terminal tail of NHE7. This interaction is significant for the localization and trafficking of NHE7 within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endosomes (Lin2005Secretory). SCAMP2, along with other SCAMP family members like SCAMP1 and SCAMP5, colocalizes with NHE7 in the TGN and post-Golgi vesicles, suggesting a role in the retrieval of NHE7 from recycling endosomes to the TGN (Lin2005Secretory).

SCAMP2 also interacts with T-type calcium channels, specifically Ca v 3.2, forming a protein complex that regulates the cell surface expression of these channels. This interaction results in a significant reduction of T-type currents, indicating that SCAMP2 affects the trafficking of Ca v 3.2 channels to the plasma membrane (Cmarko2022Secretory).

Additionally, SCAMP2 interacts with the Na+–K+–2Cl− cotransporter type 2 (NKCC2), retaining it in a recycling compartment and reducing its surface abundance. This interaction suggests a broader role for SCAMP2 in regulating the surface expression of various transporters (Carmosino2012Na+–K+–2Cl−).
