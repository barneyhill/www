# CNOT9

## Overview
CNOT9 is a gene that encodes the protein CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 9, which is a crucial component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a multi-subunit assembly involved in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. The protein is characterized by its armadillo repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein and potential RNA interactions, playing a significant role in mRNA deadenylation and decay processes (Chalabi2020The; Shirai2014Multifunctional). As a part of the CCR4-NOT complex, CNOT9 contributes to the regulation of gene expression by modulating mRNA stability and degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Pavanello2018The). The protein's interactions with various RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors underscore its involvement in transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation (Shirai2014Multifunctional). Additionally, alterations in CNOT9 expression and mutations have been linked to cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2014A).

## Structure
CNOT9, also known as Caf40 or Rcd1, is a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex and plays a role in mRNA regulation. The protein structure of CNOT9 includes six armadillo repeats, which form a solvent-accessible, positively charged cleft approximately 21-22 Å wide. This cleft is involved in protein-protein interactions and potentially RNA binding (Chalabi2020The; Shirai2014Multifunctional). The armadillo repeat motif is characterized by a bundle of 18 α-helices arranged in a clockwork spiral, providing a platform for interactions (Xu2014Insights).

CNOT9 interacts with the DUF3819 domain of CNOT1, forming part of the CCR4-NOT complex's architecture (Pavanello2018The; Xu2014Insights). The protein can form a homodimer or interact with other proteins, such as NIF-1 and c-Myb, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and mRNA decay (Shirai2014Multifunctional). Although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided, CNOT9's role in enhancing deadenylation suggests it may undergo modifications that influence its function (Chalabi2020The).

## Function
CNOT9, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, plays a significant role in regulating mRNA stability and degradation in human cells. It is involved in the deadenylation process, which shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA, a crucial step for mRNA decay and regulation of gene expression (Chalabi2020The; Pavanello2018The). CNOT9 enhances the deadenylation activity of the CCR4-NOT nuclease module, likely due to its proximity to exonucleases within the complex (Chalabi2020The). This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating mRNA turnover (Chalabi2020The).

CNOT9 interacts with the central coiled coil domain of CNOT1, contributing to the structural integrity of the CCR4-NOT complex (Chalabi2020The; Lau2009Human). It also binds to RNA-binding proteins, facilitating targeted mRNA deadenylation and decay (Raisch2019Reconstitution). In addition to its role in mRNA decay, CNOT9 is involved in transcriptional regulation, interacting with transcription factors and influencing processes such as cell differentiation and development (Shirai2014Multifunctional). CNOT9 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting various cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CNOT9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. The P131L amino acid substitution in CNOT9, frequently observed in melanoma tumors, is a result of a recurrent somatic mutation. This mutation affects the thermal stability of the CNOT9 protein but does not significantly alter its deadenylation activity within the Ccr4-Not complex, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression without disrupting enzymatic function (Pavanello2018The).

CNOT9 is also overexpressed in breast cancer cells, indicating its involvement in cancer biology. This overexpression may influence cellular processes such as mRNA degradation and stability, contributing to tumorigenesis (Chen2014A). The interaction of CNOT9 with other proteins, such as those involved in EGFR signaling, suggests that alterations in these interactions could impact cancer progression (Chen2014A).

While the clinical significance of CNOT9 mutations is not fully understood, these findings highlight the potential impact of CNOT9 on cancer development and progression, warranting further investigation into its role as a therapeutic target or biomarker in oncology.

## Interactions
CNOT9, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in mRNA regulation. It interacts with the DUF3819 domain of CNOT1, forming a complex that stimulates the deadenylation activity of the nuclease module within the CCR4-NOT complex (Pavanello2018The). CNOT9 also binds to the silencing domains of TNRC6 proteins, which are part of the miRNA-mediated gene silencing machinery. This interaction is facilitated by tryptophan-binding pockets in CNOT9, which are essential for recruiting the CCR4-NOT complex to miRNA targets (Chen2014A; Mathys2014Structural).

CNOT9 interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as GW182, TTP, and Roquin, suggesting its role in targeting specific mRNAs for degradation (Pavanello2023Regulation; Pavanello2018The). The protein also forms a pentameric complex with CNOT1, BTG2, Caf1, and Ccr4, which enhances the deadenylation activity of the nuclease module (Pavanello2018The). These interactions highlight CNOT9's function as a hub for various regulatory proteins, influencing mRNA stability and degradation (Pavanello2023Regulation).
