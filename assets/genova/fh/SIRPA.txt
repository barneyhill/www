# SIRPA

## Overview
SIRPA is a gene that encodes the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. SIRPα is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor. The protein plays a pivotal role in immune regulation by interacting with CD47, a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein, to deliver a "don't-eat-me" signal that prevents the phagocytosis of healthy cells, thereby maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Morrissey2020CD47; Barclay2014The). Structurally, SIRPα is characterized by three Ig-like domains and contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic tail, which are crucial for its signaling functions (Jalil2020Macrophage; Barclay2014The). The SIRPA gene and its encoded protein are of significant clinical interest due to their involvement in cancer immune evasion and autoimmune diseases, making them potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Willingham2012The; Barclay2014The).

## Structure
Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) is a transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). It is composed of three Ig-like domains: one N-terminal V-like domain (D1) and two C1-like domains (Jalil2020Macrophage). The primary structure of SIRPα includes a sequence of amino acids that form these domains, with the N-terminal domain being particularly polymorphic (Barclay2014The). The secondary structure of SIRPα features typical immunoglobulin-like folds, including alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its tertiary structure (Barclay2009Signal).

The tertiary structure of SIRPα is characterized by an extended conformation, with the NH2-terminal domain interacting with the single domain of CD47. This interaction is mediated predominantly by loops at the NH2-terminal ends of the two molecules, resembling the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in antigen receptors (Barclay2014The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of complexes with other proteins, such as CD47, which is crucial for its function in cell signaling (Barclay2014The).

Post-translational modifications of SIRPα include phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail, which contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit SH2 domain-containing phosphatases (Barclay2014The). Glycosylation is also present, although it is not necessary for the interaction with CD47 (Jalil2020Macrophage). SIRPα may exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can alter its function and interactions (Jalil2020Macrophage).

## Function
Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in immune regulation by acting as an inhibitory receptor on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of phagocytosis through its interaction with CD47, a widely expressed membrane protein. This interaction provides a "don't-eat-me" signal that inhibits the engulfment of healthy cells, thereby maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Morrissey2020CD47; Barclay2014The).

SIRPA contains intracellular immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that, upon phosphorylation by Src family kinases, recruit SH2 domain-containing phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2. This recruitment leads to the dephosphorylation of substrates involved in integrin activation, thereby suppressing macrophage spreading and phagocytosis (Morrissey2020CD47; Barclay2014The). The localization of SIRPA to the phagocytic synapse is essential for its inhibitory function, which is regulated by CD47 binding (Morrissey2020CD47).

In addition to its role in phagocytosis, SIRPA is involved in cellular adhesion and migration, particularly in interactions between neutrophils or monocytes and endothelial or epithelial cells (Barclay2014The). Its function in these processes is linked to its ability to modulate integrin signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell migration and immune cell infiltration (Morrissey2020CD47).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SIRPA gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and autoimmune diseases. In cancer, the CD47-SIRPα interaction serves as an immune checkpoint that allows tumor cells to evade phagocytosis by macrophages. High CD47 expression on tumor cells sends a 'don't eat me' signal, inhibiting their clearance by the immune system. This mechanism is exploited by various cancers, including solid tumors, to avoid immune detection and destruction (Willingham2012The; Jalil2020Macrophage). Targeting this interaction with monoclonal antibodies to block CD47 or SIRPα has shown promise in promoting tumor phagocytosis and inhibiting tumor growth (Veillette2018SIRPα–CD47).

In autoimmune conditions, the CD47-SIRPα interaction is crucial for regulating phagocyte effector functions. Alterations in this pathway can lead to exaggerated clearance of red blood cells and platelets, contributing to diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (Barclay2014The). Additionally, the interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndromes, where deregulation can disturb hematopoietic homeostasis (Barclay2014The). The role of SIRPα in these processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) is a transmembrane protein that primarily interacts with CD47, forming a critical signaling system for immune regulation. The interaction between SIRPA and CD47 is essential for inhibiting phagocytosis by macrophages, as CD47 serves as a "don't eat me" signal. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal IgV domain of SIRPA and is characterized by species-specific charge complementarity, with CD47 being mostly negative and SIRPA mostly positive (Jalil2020Macrophage).

SIRPA's cytoplasmic tail contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that, upon phosphorylation, recruit protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. These phosphatases play a role in downstream inhibitory signaling pathways, limiting phagocytosis and influencing cellular adhesion and migration (Murata2014The; Barclay2014The).

SIRPA also interacts with other ligands, such as surfactant proteins A and D (Sp-A and Sp-D) in the lungs, although these interactions occur at different domains than CD47 (Jalil2020Macrophage). Additionally, SIRPA is involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathways, where it participates in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular migration, often in conjunction with proteins like SKAP2 (Alenghat2012Macrophages).
