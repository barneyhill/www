# TATDN3

## Overview
TATDN3 is a human gene that encodes the protein TatD DNase domain containing 3, which is involved in DNA repair mechanisms. This protein is categorized as a metallo-dependent hydrolase due to its reliance on metal ions for enzymatic activity. It exhibits both apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and 3'-5' exonuclease activities, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing oxidative DNA damage. The protein's structure features a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold and coordinates two zinc ions in its active site, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. TATDN3 is more effective than its paralog TATDN1 in cleaving abasic sites in double-stranded DNA, underscoring its critical role in DNA repair processes within the nucleus (Dorival2023Human).

## Function
TATDN3 is a human gene encoding a protein that plays a significant role in DNA repair processes. The TATDN3 protein exhibits both apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease activity and 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability. The AP endonuclease activity is specific to double-stranded DNA, while the exonuclease activity primarily targets single-stranded DNA. These enzymatic activities are dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Dorival2023Human).

TATDN3 is more active than its paralog TATDN1 in cleaving abasic sites in double-stranded DNA, a critical function for DNA repair in healthy human cells. This activity is essential for repairing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining genomic integrity (Dorival2023Human). The protein is localized to the nucleus, supporting its involvement in nuclear DNA repair processes (Dorival2023Human).

Structurally, TATDN3 adopts a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold, common in metallo-dependent hydrolases, and coordinates two zinc ions in its active site, which are crucial for its catalytic functions (Dorival2023Human). These structural features facilitate its role in DNA repair and contribute to its enzymatic efficiency.
