# CATSPER2

## Overview
CATSPER2 is a gene that encodes the protein cation channel sperm associated 2, which is a crucial component of the CatSper channel complex, a sperm-specific calcium ion channel. This transmembrane protein is integral to the regulation of calcium ion influx in sperm cells, playing a vital role in sperm motility and fertility. The CATSPER2 protein, characterized by its six transmembrane domains, forms part of a heterotetrameric complex with other CatSper subunits, facilitating the rapid influx of calcium ions necessary for sperm hyperactivation and successful fertilization (Rahban2020CatSper:; NowickaBauer2021Structure). Disruptions in the CATSPER2 gene can lead to male infertility and are associated with conditions such as deafness-infertility syndrome, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Avidan2003CATSPER2; Zhang2007Sensorineural).

## Structure
The CATSPER2 protein is a component of the CatSper channel complex, which is essential for sperm motility. It is a transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains, labeled S1 to S6, that contribute to its structure and function (NowickaBauer2021Structure; Sun2017The). These domains form two key regions: the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) comprising S1 to S4, and the pore-forming region consisting of S5 and S6 (NowickaBauer2021Structure). The fourth transmembrane segment (S4) contains positively charged amino acids that act as voltage sensors, a feature common in voltage-gated cation channels (Rahban2020CatSper:).

The CATSPER2 protein also includes a conserved sequence motif (T×D×W) in the linker between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains, which is crucial for selective calcium ion influx (NowickaBauer2021Structure). The protein's quaternary structure involves its assembly with other CatSper subunits, forming a heterotetrameric complex with CatSper1, CatSper3, and CatSper4, which together create the channel pore (Rahban2020CatSper:). The CATSPER2 gene is expressed specifically in the testis, and its proper function is critical for male fertility (Sun2017The).

## Function
The CATSPER2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the CatSper channel, a sperm-specific calcium ion channel essential for sperm motility and fertility. This channel is located in the flagellum of sperm cells and plays a pivotal role in regulating calcium entry, which is crucial for sperm hyperactivation, a process necessary for successful fertilization (Rahban2020CatSper:). The CatSper channel is composed of four pore-forming α subunits, including CATSPER2, which together form a complex that facilitates the rapid influx of calcium ions into sperm cells upon interaction with progesterone (Williams2015Specific; Rahban2020CatSper:).

In healthy human cells, CATSPER2 is involved in the regulation of sperm motility by enabling efficient calcium signal propagation along the flagellum. This is achieved through the organization of the CatSper channels into quadrilateral longitudinal nanodomains, which synchronize the opening of the channels and facilitate the propagation of calcium waves. These waves are essential for hyperactive motility and chemotaxis, which are critical for the sperm's ability to navigate through the female reproductive tract and achieve fertilization (Rahban2020CatSper:). The proper function of CATSPER2 is thus vital for male fertility, as disruptions in this gene can lead to infertility (Young2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CATSPER2 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with male infertility and deafness-infertility syndrome. CATSPER2 is crucial for sperm motility, and its disruption can lead to idiopathic male infertility, even when semen parameters appear normal. A novel copy number variation (CNV) in CATSPER2 has been linked to reduced expression of the gene, resulting in impaired sperm function, including reduced hyperactivation and penetration ability, which are essential for fertility (Luo2019A).

CATSPER2 mutations are also implicated in deafness-infertility syndrome, a condition characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and male infertility. This syndrome often results from contiguous gene deletions that include CATSPER2 and the STRC gene, which is expressed in the inner ear. The deletion of these genes leads to asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition marked by malformed sperm with poor motility (Zhang2007Sensorineural; Hildebrand2010Genetic).

In some cases, CATSPER2 mutations are associated with syndromic male infertility, where affected individuals exhibit additional symptoms such as congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type 1 (Avidan2003CATSPER2). These findings underscore the critical role of CATSPER2 in both fertility and hearing.

## Interactions
CATSPER2 is a component of the CatSper channel complex, which is essential for sperm motility and fertility. It interacts with other CatSper proteins, including CATSPER1, CATSPER3, and CATSPER4, to form the pore of the channel complex. This interaction is crucial for the channel's function, facilitating calcium ion influx necessary for sperm hyperactivation and motility (Rahban2020CatSper:).

The CatSper complex also includes auxiliary subunits such as CatSperβ, CatSperγ, CatSperδ, CatSperζ, and EFCAB9, which modulate the channel's activity. EFCAB9, in particular, acts as a pH-dependent calcium sensor that regulates the channel's activity by interacting with CatSperζ, affecting the channel's response to alkalinization and calcium conduction (Rahban2020CatSper:; Hwang2018EFCAB9).

CATSPER2's role in the CatSper complex is underscored by its involvement in male infertility when disrupted. Pathogenic mutations or deletions in the CATSPER2 gene can lead to conditions such as asthenoteratozoospermia and nonsyndromic deafness, highlighting its critical function in sperm motility and fertility (Sehrish2011CatSper; Avidan2003CATSPER2).
