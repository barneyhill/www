# MRPS18A

## Overview
MRPS18A is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18A, which is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, playing a pivotal role in translating mitochondrial mRNA into proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular ATP production (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). As a structural protein, mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18A is involved in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). The gene's expression is notably altered in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and its involvement in disease progression (Sørensen2017Upregulation; Zhou2021Long).

## Function
MRPS18A encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). MRPS18A is active within the mitochondria, contributing significantly to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

The protein is involved in the structural composition of the mitochondrial ribosome, where it occupies distinct sites and coordinates zinc atoms, despite missing a zinc-coordinating residue (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). This structural role is vital for the proper functioning of the ribosome in translating mitochondrial mRNA. The presence of MRPS18A in the ribosome suggests its involvement in guiding mRNA into the ribosomal channel, which is essential for accurate and efficient protein synthesis (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

MRPS18A's function in healthy human cells is primarily linked to its role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, which are critical for various cellular processes and overall organismal health (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS18A has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, MRPS18A is upregulated, which is associated with the increased energy metabolism typical of cancer cells. This upregulation suggests potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications, although MRPS18A is not exclusive to cancer cells (Sørensen2017Upregulation). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MRPS18A expression is enhanced and is involved in the progression of the disease. The long noncoding RNA TRIM52-AS1 facilitates HCC progression by sponging miR-514a-5p, which leads to increased MRPS18A expression (Zhou2021Long). MRPS18A is also associated with cholangiocarcinoma, where it correlates with clinical features such as pathological stage and overall survival, indicating its potential role in the disease's progression or prognosis (Bao2022Potential).

Beyond cancer, MRPS18A has been linked to developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, although specific conditions are not detailed in the provided context (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). The gene's expression changes in various cancers and its potential as a biomarker warrant further investigation to understand its role in disease pathology (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).
