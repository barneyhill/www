# TSNARE1

## Overview
TSNARE1 is a gene that encodes the protein t-SNARE domain containing 1, which is a crucial component of the SNARE complex involved in synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in neurons. This protein plays a significant role in the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, facilitating effective neuronal communication and synaptic transmission (Schrode2019Synergistic; Fromer2016Gene). The TSNARE1 gene is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues, where it contributes to presynaptic vesicle exocytosis and synaptic integrity. Alterations in TSNARE1 expression have been linked to neurodevelopmental changes and are implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2020Novel; Schrode2019Synergistic).

## Structure


## Function
The TSNARE1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the SNARE complex, which is essential for the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane in neurons. This process is crucial for the synchronized release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, facilitating effective neuronal communication (Fromer2016Gene). TSNARE1 is primarily active in synaptic vesicles, playing a significant role in synaptic transmission and cellular communication (Schrode2019Synergistic).

In healthy human cells, TSNARE1 is involved in presynaptic vesicle exocytosis, a process necessary for neurotransmitter release and synaptic communication. This function is critical for maintaining proper synaptic function and neural network activity (Schrode2019Synergistic). The gene's expression levels can influence neurodevelopmental processes, as evidenced by studies showing that overexpression of TSNARE1 in model organisms leads to changes in brain development, such as decreased head size and altered cell proliferation and apoptosis (Fromer2016Gene).

TSNARE1's role in synaptic vesicle recycling and its involvement in synaptic phenotypes, such as changes in synaptic puncta, further underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Schrode2019Synergistic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TSNARE1 gene have been implicated in the risk of developing schizophrenia. Studies have shown that TSNARE1 is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a critical process for neurotransmitter release, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Schrode2019Synergistic; Fromer2016Gene). In particular, TSNARE1 has been identified as a gene with potential associations to schizophrenia onset, with its expression linked to presynaptic functions (Li2020Novel; Schrode2019Synergistic).

Research using CRISPR-based methods has demonstrated that manipulating TSNARE1 expression can affect synaptic phenotypes, such as the number and size of synaptic vesicles, which are crucial for proper neuronal communication (Schrode2019Synergistic). Additionally, overexpression of TSNARE1 in zebrafish models has been associated with neuroanatomical changes, including a decrease in head size and increased cell apoptosis, suggesting its role in neurodevelopmental processes (Fromer2016Gene).

The gene has also been highlighted in studies focusing on genetic susceptibility loci for schizophrenia, emphasizing its potential clinical significance in understanding the complex etiology of the disorder (Li2020Novel; Schrode2019Synergistic).

## Interactions
TSNARE1, a protein involved in vesicular transport processes, is a component of the SNARE complex, which is essential for the fusion of vesicles with target membranes. This complex facilitates neurotransmitter release and other cellular transport mechanisms. TSNARE1 interacts with other SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin and SNAP-25, to mediate membrane fusion (Lee2024Genetic). These interactions are crucial for the docking, priming, and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane in neurons, which is vital for synchronizing neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft (Fromer2016Gene).

The role of TSNARE1 in synaptic vesicle exocytosis suggests its involvement in intracellular protein transport, particularly in the context of neurodevelopment and synaptic function (Li2020Novel). Although the specific protein interactions of TSNARE1 are not detailed extensively, bioinformatic predictions indicate that TSNARE1 may bind SNARE and have SNAP receptor activity, suggesting its participation in complex protein interactions necessary for synaptic processes (Liu2021MAD1L1). These interactions highlight the importance of TSNARE1 in maintaining synaptic integrity and its potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Schrode2019Synergistic).
