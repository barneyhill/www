# MESD

## Overview
The MESD gene encodes the mesoderm development LRP chaperone, a protein that plays a crucial role in the proper folding and trafficking of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins, specifically LRP5 and LRP6, within the endoplasmic reticulum. This chaperone is integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes, including skeletal homeostasis and bone formation (Stürznickel2020Compound; Li2005Mesd). The MESD protein functions not only as a chaperone but also as a receptor antagonist, modulating receptor activity at the cell surface and influencing ligand interactions (Li2005Mesd). Its universal expression across human cell lines underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and development (Li2005Mesd). Disruptions in MESD function can lead to significant developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Lighthouse2010MESD).

## Function
The MESD gene encodes a protein that functions as a chaperone for low-density lipoprotein receptors LRP5 and LRP6 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This chaperone activity is essential for the correct folding of β-propeller/epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules and their subsequent trafficking to the Golgi apparatus, which are critical steps for the maturation of these receptors (Stürznickel2020Compound; Li2005Mesd). MESD plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway by ensuring the proper localization and function of LRP5 and LRP6, which are integral to this pathway. Wnt signaling is crucial for regulating skeletal homeostasis, including osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (Stürznickel2020Compound).

In healthy human cells, MESD's function is vital for maintaining the balance between bone resorption and formation, contributing to overall bone health and development (Stürznickel2020Compound). MESD also acts as a receptor antagonist by binding to mature LRP6 at the cell surface, inhibiting ligand binding, which suggests a regulatory role in LRP5/6 function and potentially influencing Wnt signaling pathways (Li2005Mesd). MESD is universally expressed in various human cell lines, indicating its importance in normal cellular functions (Li2005Mesd).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the MESD gene can lead to significant developmental disorders due to its critical role in the Wnt signaling pathway and the trafficking of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRPs). MESD is essential for the proper folding and trafficking of LRP5 and LRP6, which are crucial for Wnt signaling. Disruptions in MESD function can result in impaired Wnt signaling, leading to developmental defects such as the failure of primitive streak formation and mesoderm differentiation (Lighthouse2010MESD). 

In Mesd knockout embryos, there is a persistent expression of pluripotency markers, indicating a block in differentiation processes (Lighthouse2010MESD). The absence of MESD also affects the apical localization of LRP2 (megalin) in the visceral endoderm, leading to impaired endocytosis and nutrient absorption, which can contribute to developmental abnormalities (Lighthouse2010MESD). 

The clinical significance of MESD mutations may extend to conditions involving disrupted endocytosis or trafficking, similar to other mutations affecting proteins like Dab2 and Cubn, which result in developmental defects (Lighthouse2010MESD). MESD's role in LRP maturation and function suggests potential links to diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's, diabetes, osteoporosis, and kidney disease (Lighthouse2010MESD).

## Interactions
The MESD protein interacts with several members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) family, particularly LRP5 and LRP6. MESD acts as a chaperone, ensuring the proper folding and trafficking of these receptors within the endoplasmic reticulum. It binds specifically to the mature forms of LRP5 and LRP6, facilitating their correct conformation and preventing aggregation (Li2005Mesd). The C-terminal region of MESD is crucial for its binding to LRP6, with the last 45 amino acids being necessary and sufficient for this interaction (Li2005Mesd).

MESD also plays a role in modulating receptor activity at the cell surface. It binds to LRP6 with high affinity, acting as an antagonist by inhibiting ligand binding, such as the binding of DKK1, a known antagonist of LRP6. This interaction affects the Wnt signaling pathway, although MESD does not significantly alter cytosolic β-catenin levels (Li2005Mesd). MESD's interaction with LRP2 is also significant, as it is essential for the apical localization of LRP2 in the visceral endoderm, impacting endocytosis and lysosome formation (Lighthouse2010MESD).
