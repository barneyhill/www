# MPPED1

## Overview
MPPED1 is a gene that encodes the protein metallophosphoesterase domain containing 1, which is characterized by its metallophosphoesterase activity. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds and is categorized as a phosphodiesterase due to its ability to hydrolyze cyclic AMP (cAMP) into 2'-AMP or 3'-AMP (Chen2010Expression). MPPED1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with neuronal development and function, such as the cortical plate of the developing telencephalon and the hippocampal CA1 region (Chen2010Expression; Ricciardello2021Genotype–phenotype). The gene's expression pattern and enzymatic activity suggest a role in modulating neuronal signaling pathways, which may be critical for brain development and function. Additionally, MPPED1 has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ricciardello2021Genotype–phenotype; Tabet2017A).

## Function
MPPED1 is a gene that encodes a protein with a metallophosphoesterase domain, which is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds. This protein is expressed in the adult brain and is particularly active in the cortical plate of the developing telencephalon and the hippocampal CA1 region postnatally (Chen2010Expression; Ricciardello2021Genotype–phenotype). MPPED1 exhibits metal-dependent phosphodiesterase activity, specifically hydrolyzing cyclic AMP (cAMP) to form either 2'-AMP or 3'-AMP, a function that distinguishes it from its closely related gene, MPPED2 (Chen2010Expression).

The expression of MPPED1 in the brain suggests its involvement in neuronal development and function, potentially influencing cortical neuron migration and layer formation (Chen2010Expression; Ricciardello2021Genotype–phenotype). Although its precise molecular functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood, MPPED1's activity in the cytoplasm may impact cellular differentiation and growth. The gene's expression pattern and enzymatic activity indicate a role in modulating neuronal function, possibly through its involvement in signaling pathways critical for brain function (Chen2010Expression; Ricciardello2021Genotype–phenotype).

## Clinical Significance
The MPPED1 gene, located on chromosome 22q13.3, has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Alterations in MPPED1 expression have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, although direct evidence linking the gene to these conditions is still lacking (Ricciardello2021Genotype–phenotype). The gene's location on chromosome 22q13.3, a region linked to various psychiatric disorders and brain malignancies, suggests its potential involvement in these conditions (Chen2010Expression).

In the context of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS), MPPED1 is one of the genes within a critical region on chromosome 22q13 that may contribute to the syndrome's phenotype. This region is associated with a higher risk of clinical features such as absence of speech, and MPPED1 is considered a candidate gene for these manifestations due to its expression in the brain and potential haploinsufficiency (Tabet2017A).

Research in model organisms like Drosophila has shown that orthologs of MPPED1 play roles in longevity and sensory responses, suggesting that similar pathways might be affected in humans, although the direct clinical significance of MPPED1 mutations in human diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Gupta2023Neuronal).

## Interactions
MPPED1, a human gene encoding a metallophosphoesterase, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. In the context of chronic periodontitis (CP) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), MPPED1 is identified as one of the cross-talk genes that directly interact in both conditions, suggesting its involvement in shared pathways between these diseases (Li2018Shared). Although specific protein partners in humans are not detailed, studies on its Drosophila ortholog, dMpped, provide insights into potential interactions. dMpped interacts with SH3PX1, a protein involved in vesicular sorting and synaptic function, through its SH3 domain, indicating a possible scaffolding role for MPPED1 in similar pathways (Gupta2023Neuronal; Gupta2020An).

Additionally, MPPED1 is part of the neuroinflammation pathway and is indirectly connected to SPP1, a gene known to be differentially expressed in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Go2020Genomewide). While direct interactions with nucleic acids are not specified, the presence of differentially methylated regions in MPPED1 in both CP and OSCC suggests epigenetic regulation may play a role in its function (Li2018Shared).
