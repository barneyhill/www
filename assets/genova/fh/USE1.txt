# USE1

## Overview
The USE1 gene encodes the protein known as unconventional SNARE in the ER 1, which is a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) family involved in vesicular transport and membrane fusion processes. This protein plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by facilitating the retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein trafficking (Liu2022SNARE). USE1 is also a bispecific conjugating enzyme that participates in the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 conjugation pathway, influencing protein degradation and cellular regulation (Aichem2014Investigations). Additionally, USE1 has been implicated in viral processes, such as the propagation of the mumps virus, by interacting with viral proteins to facilitate their glycosylation and expression (Liu2022SNARE). Mutations in the USE1 gene have been linked to congenital neurological abnormalities, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (AmerSarsour2022Polyalanine).

## Structure
The USE1 protein, also known as unconventional SNARE in the ER 1, is involved in vesicular transport and is part of the SNARE family, which facilitates membrane fusion. Structurally, USE1 is characterized by its interaction with other proteins in the SNARE complex, particularly in the context of the Dsl1 complex. The N-terminal domain of USE1 is suggested to be highly α-helical, which is a common feature in SNARE proteins, contributing to its role in membrane fusion (Travis2020Structural).

USE1 is also involved in the FAT10 conjugation pathway, where it undergoes auto-FAT10ylation. This post-translational modification occurs primarily at lysine 323, although other lysines can also be modified. This modification does not inhibit USE1's enzymatic activity, allowing it to continue functioning in ubiquitin and FAT10 transfer processes (Aichem2014Investigations).

In the context of viral infections, USE1 interacts with the mumps virus fusion protein, playing a crucial role in the glycosylation and expression of the viral protein, which is essential for viral propagation (Liu2022SNARE). These interactions highlight the importance of USE1 in both cellular and viral processes.

## Function
The USE1 protein, also known as UBA6-specific E2 enzyme 1, plays a significant role in the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 to its substrates, targeting them for degradation by the proteasome. This process is crucial for regulating protein levels within the cell and maintaining cellular homeostasis. USE1 is a bispecific conjugating enzyme that can accept activated ubiquitin and FAT10 from the E1 enzyme UBA6. It undergoes self-FAT10ylation, transferring FAT10 from its active site to a lysine residue on itself, which serves as a negative feedback mechanism to limit FAT10 conjugation by promoting the proteasomal degradation of the USE1-FAT10 conjugate (Aichem2014Investigations).

In healthy human cells, USE1 is involved in various cellular processes, including antigen presentation, signal transduction, cell cycle control, and chromosomal segregation, through its involvement in FAT10 conjugation pathways (Aichem2014Investigations). Additionally, USE1 is part of the SNARE complex, facilitating vesicular transport within cells, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This function is essential for protein trafficking, membrane dynamics, and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Liu2022SNARE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USE1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Polyalanine expansion mutations in USE1 are associated with congenital neurological abnormalities. These mutations impair the ubiquitin transfer process, affecting protein degradation pathways, which may contribute to congenital malformations observed in polyalanine diseases (AmerSarsour2022Polyalanine). The interaction between polyalanine stretches and the UBA6 enzyme, which is crucial for the ubiquitination process involving USE1, is disrupted by these mutations. This disruption can lead to increased levels of E6AP, a protein linked to neurological disorders such as Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorders (AmerSarsour2022Polyalanine).

USE1 also plays a significant role in the propagation of the mumps virus (MuV). It is involved in the glycosylation and expression of the MuV fusion protein, which is essential for viral propagation. Knockdown of USE1 significantly reduces viral RNA, protein expression, and infectious virus titers, highlighting its importance in the viral life cycle (Liu2022SNARE). These findings suggest that alterations in USE1 expression or function can impact viral infections, potentially offering a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
USE1, or unconventional SNARE in the ER 1, is involved in several protein interactions critical for its function as a bispecific conjugating enzyme and in vesicular transport processes. USE1 interacts specifically with the E1 enzyme UBA6, facilitating the transfer of activated ubiquitin and FAT10, a ubiquitin-like modifier, to itself. This interaction is unique as USE1 does not interact with other E1 enzymes like UBE1 or UBE1L (Aichem2010USE1). USE1 also forms a covalent conjugate with FAT10, which is not reducible by agents like β-mercaptoethanol, indicating a stable interaction (Aichem2010USE1). 

In the context of mumps virus (MuV) infection, USE1 interacts with the MuV fusion (F) protein, playing a role in its glycosylation and expression. This interaction is crucial for viral propagation, as evidenced by the reduced viral RNA and protein levels upon USE1 knockdown (Liu2022SNARE). USE1 is also part of the SNARE complex involved in Golgi-ER retrograde transport, interacting with other SNARE proteins such as STX18, BNIP1, and SEC22B, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein trafficking (Liu2022SNARE).
