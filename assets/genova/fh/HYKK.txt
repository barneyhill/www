# HYKK

## Overview
HYKK is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxylysine kinase, which is classified as a kinase due to its role in catalyzing the phosphorylation of hydroxylysine. This enzyme is integral to the lysine degradation pathway, where it facilitates the conversion of hydroxylysine into α-aminoadipic semialdehyde, ammonia, and inorganic phosphate. Hydroxylysine kinase is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is crucial for collagen biosynthesis, impacting tissue integrity and repair. Beyond its metabolic functions, HYKK has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where genetic variants may influence cancer risk (Song2024Systematic; Leandro2020The).

## Function
HYKK, also known as hydroxylysine kinase, is an enzyme involved in the lysine degradation pathway, specifically in the phosphorylation of hydroxylysine, a post-translational modification product of lysine. This phosphorylation is a critical step in converting free hydroxylysine into α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA), ammonia, and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme PHYKPL facilitates this conversion, highlighting the importance of HYKK in lysine metabolism (Leandro2020The).

HYKK is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it modifies nascent proteins by phosphorylating hydroxylysine residues. This modification plays a significant role in collagen biosynthesis, impacting tissue integrity and repair. The phosphorylation of hydroxylysine by HYKK can affect protein stability, interactions, and function, which are crucial for maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Leandro2020The).

In addition to its role in lysine degradation, HYKK has been identified as a potentially druggable target for lung cancer, particularly lung squamous cell carcinoma. Variants in the HYKK gene, such as rs931794, have been associated with an increased risk of this cancer subtype, suggesting a broader biological significance beyond its enzymatic activity in lysine metabolism (Song2024Systematic).
