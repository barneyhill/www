# TAS2R5

## Overview
TAS2R5 is a gene that encodes the taste 2 receptor member 5, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the perception of bitter taste. This receptor is part of the TAS2R family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a hallmark of GPCRs (Pallante2021On; Behrens2016G). While primarily associated with gustatory functions, TAS2R5 is also expressed in non-gustatory tissues, such as human airway smooth muscle cells, where it plays a role in modulating muscle relaxation through calcium signaling pathways (Kim2020Identification). The receptor's ability to bind diverse bitter compounds and its involvement in various physiological processes suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like asthma and certain cancers (Kim2020Identification; Carey2022Impact). Additionally, variations in TAS2R5 expression have been linked to behavioral and psychiatric conditions, including alcohol consumption and schizophrenia (Kurshed2022The; Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

## Structure
TAS2R5, a member of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Pallante2021On; Behrens2016G). The receptor structure includes a short extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus, connected by three extracellular loops (ECLs) and three intracellular loops (ICLs) (Pallante2021On). The transmembrane domain (TMD) bundle forms the structural core, facilitating ligand binding in the extracellular region and signal transduction through the intracellular region (Pallante2021On).

TAS2R5 lacks certain conserved motifs and disulfide bridges typical of class A GPCRs but contains specific residues that may stabilize its inactive conformation (Pallante2021On). The receptor is a glycoprotein with a conserved site for Asn-linked glycosylation in the second extracellular loop, which is crucial for its function (Behrens2016G). Glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence receptor function and signaling (Behrens2016G).

TAS2R5 can form homo- and heterooligomers in vitro, although the functional consequences of these formations are not well understood (Behrens2016G). The receptor's ligand-binding pocket is located on the extracellular side of the TMD bundle, allowing it to recognize chemically diverse bitter compounds (Spaggiari2020Sweet).

## Function
The TAS2R5 gene encodes a subtype of bitter taste receptors, which are part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are traditionally associated with the detection of bitter substances in taste cells. However, TAS2R5 is also expressed in various non-gustatory tissues, including human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells. In these cells, activation of TAS2R5 leads to the coupling of the receptor to the Gαi family of G proteins, resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and subsequent muscle relaxation. This mechanism suggests a potential role for TAS2R5 in modulating airway smooth muscle cell function, offering a target for bronchodilator therapies to treat obstructive lung diseases like asthma (Kim2020Identification).

TAS2R5 agonists operate through a mechanism involving calcium ion signaling rather than the cAMP pathway used by traditional β-agonists. This distinct pathway may provide effective bronchodilation with fewer adverse effects, making TAS2R5 a promising target for novel therapeutic approaches (Kim2020Identification). The receptor's expression in various tissues suggests it may have roles beyond taste perception, potentially influencing respiratory defense mechanisms (Beckett2014Bitter).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TAS2R5 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, higher expression levels of TAS2R5 have been linked to negative survival outcomes in certain tumor types, such as kidney clear cell carcinoma and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. This suggests that TAS2R5 expression could serve as a prognostic biomarker for these cancers, with higher expression correlating with shorter survival times (Carey2022Impact).

In schizophrenia, a significant reduction in TAS2R5 mRNA expression has been observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of affected individuals. This decrease in expression is maintained even after correcting for false discovery rates, indicating a potential link between TAS2R5 expression and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The study also found that TAS2R5 expression correlates with the daily antipsychotic dose, suggesting that antipsychotic treatment may influence TAS2R5 expression levels (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

Additionally, TAS2R5 has been implicated in alcohol consumption behaviors. The rs2227264 polymorphism in TAS2R5 is associated with higher total alcohol intake, particularly rice wine consumption, in individuals with the TT genotype (Kurshed2022The). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of TAS2R5 in various health conditions.
