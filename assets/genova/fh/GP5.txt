# GP5

## Overview
The GP5 gene encodes the glycoprotein V (GPV) platelet, a critical component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the surface of human platelets. This complex plays a pivotal role in platelet adhesion and aggregation, particularly under high shear conditions, by mediating interactions with von Willebrand factor (VWF) and collagen. GPV is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a significant extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. The GP5 gene is essential for normal platelet function and production, as evidenced by its involvement in thrombus formation and hemostatic responses. While mutations in GP5 are not associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, the gene is implicated in immune thrombocytopenia and influences platelet count through its expression levels (Lee2019Integrative; Bryckaert2014Of; Gardiner2018Proteolytic).

## Structure
The GP5 gene encodes the glycoprotein V (GPV) platelet, a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet membrane. GPV is composed of 544 amino acids and features 15 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences in its extracellular domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Bryckaert2014Of). The intracellular domain of GPV is relatively short, consisting of 16 amino acids, and it binds to calmodulin and the adapter protein 14-3-3f (Bryckaert2014Of). 

GPV is a non-covalently associated subunit of the GPIb-IX-V complex, present with approximately 15,000 copies on the platelet surface (Bender2016Model). The ectodomain of GPV contains a thrombin cleavage site, which is conserved across species and leads to the generation of soluble GPV (sGPV) upon cleavage (Bender2016Model). This cleavage can also be mediated by ADAM17 and ADAM10, resulting in a slightly longer variant of sGPV (Bender2016Model). 

The GPIb-IX-V complex, which includes GPV, is essential for platelet adhesion and aggregation, particularly under high shear conditions. It is composed of two trimers, each consisting of GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX, connected by one GPV (Bryckaert2014Of).

## Function
GP5, or glycoprotein V platelet, is a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the surface of human platelets, playing a crucial role in platelet adhesion and activation. This complex is essential for platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and collagen, which are critical for thrombus formation and hemostatic responses (Gardiner2018Proteolytic). GP5 is involved in the initial stages of blood clot formation by mediating the interaction between platelets and VWF, facilitating platelet adhesion under high-shear conditions (Salles2008Inherited).

The GP5 protein has a soluble extracellular domain that is cleaved by thrombin during platelet activation, which suggests its involvement in platelet function and production (Lee2019Integrative). Knockdown experiments in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived megakaryocytes have shown that silencing GP5 results in reduced platelet production, indicating a causal role in platelet production (Lee2019Integrative). GP5 is also implicated in immune thrombocytopenia through alloantibodies and other immune responses, although mutations in GP5 are not known to cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome (Lee2019Integrative). The protein's activity is primarily on the surface of platelets, contributing to their function in maintaining vascular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the GP5 gene have been implicated in immune thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by low platelet counts due to increased platelet clearance. This can be triggered by alloantibodies targeting GP5 or autoimmune responses in conditions such as pediatric varicella, rheumatoid arthritis, and reactions to quinidine (Lee2019Integrative). Although GP5 is part of the glycoprotein complex involved in platelet adhesion, mutations in GP5 are not known to cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder. Instead, Bernard-Soulier syndrome is associated with mutations in other genes of the glycoprotein complex, such as GP1BA, GP1BB, and GP9 (Lanza2006BernardSoulier; Minkov2021Novel).

The GP5 gene is also linked to platelet traits, with studies showing a consistent association between higher levels of plasma GP5 and increased platelet count. Knockdown experiments have demonstrated that reducing GP5 expression leads to decreased platelet production, highlighting its role in maintaining platelet numbers (Lee2019Integrative). These findings suggest that maintaining normal GP5 function or expression levels could be crucial for preserving platelet numbers in circulation, potentially impacting conditions related to platelet function or disorders (Lee2019Integrative).

## Interactions
GP5, also known as glycoprotein V platelet, is a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet membrane. This complex is crucial for platelet adhesion and aggregation, particularly through its interaction with von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thrombin. GP5 is non-covalently associated with other subunits of the complex, such as GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX, forming a receptor that facilitates platelet activation and thrombus formation under high shear conditions (Bryckaert2014Of).

GP5 contains a thrombin cleavage site, which is conserved across species, including humans, mice, and rats. This site allows for the cleavage of GP5 by thrombin, leading to its removal from the platelet surface and the generation of soluble GP5 (sGP5) (Bender2016Model). The cleavage of GP5 by thrombin and other enzymes like ADAM17 and ADAM10 is a regulatory mechanism that modulates platelet reactivity and surface receptor expression (Bender2016Model).

GP5 also interacts with intracellular proteins such as calmodulin and the adapter protein 14-3-3f, which are involved in platelet signaling pathways. These interactions suggest a role for GP5 in modulating platelet activation and aggregation (Bryckaert2014Of).
