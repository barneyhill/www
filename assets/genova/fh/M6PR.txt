# M6PR

## Overview
The M6PR gene encodes the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. This receptor is essential for the proper sorting and transport of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-tagged acid hydrolases from the Golgi apparatus to the endosomal-lysosomal system, ensuring their delivery to lysosomes where they perform critical degradative functions. The CD-MPR is characterized by its ability to bind M6P ligands and its involvement in various cellular compartments, including the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, but it is notably absent from lysosomes to prevent its degradation. The receptor's function is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as GGAs and adaptor protein complexes, which facilitate its trafficking and sorting. Alterations in the expression or function of M6PR have been implicated in several lysosomal storage disorders and other diseases, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology (Frustaci2022Downregulation; Coutinho2012Mannose6phosphate; Ghosh2003Mannose).

## Structure
The human mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), cation dependent, is a transmembrane protein involved in lysosomal enzyme trafficking. Its extracellular domain (ECD) is complex, containing 15 mannose receptor homology (MRH) domains, with 14 fully intact and a partial MRH domain 15 (Dwyer2020Expression). The ECD is approximately 280 kDa in size and is monomeric (Dwyer2020Expression). 

The primary structure of M6PR consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes specific domains like the mannose-6-phosphate binding domain, which is crucial for its function. Domains 3, 5, 9, and 15 have M6P binding sites, with domain 3 showing cooperative binding, while domain 15 binds M6P with much weaker affinity (Dwyer2020Expression). 

Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, are prominent, with 13 out of 14 potential sites being glycosylated (Dwyer2020Expression). These modifications contribute to the protein's stability and function. The N-terminus of the protein is slightly shorter than expected, and the C-terminus supports a TACE cleavage release mechanism (Dwyer2020Expression).

## Function
The mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), specifically the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), plays a crucial role in the trafficking of acid hydrolases in healthy human cells. This receptor is responsible for binding mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-containing soluble acid hydrolases in the Golgi apparatus and transporting them to the endosomal-lysosomal system. The CD-MPR is predominantly present as a stable homodimer in membranes and has a single M6P-binding site per polypeptide (Ghosh2003Mannose).

The trafficking of M6PRs involves their presence in various cellular compartments, including the trans-Golgi network (TGN), early endosomes, recycling endosomes, and late endosomes, but they are notably absent from lysosomes. This absence is crucial as it prevents the degradation of the receptors (Ghosh2003Mannose). The CD-MPR undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and palmitoylation, which are important for its function (Ghosh2003Mannose).

The receptor's structure, including its dimerization and the formation of a β-barrel structure, is essential for high-affinity binding of multivalent M6P ligands. The CD-MPR also interacts with various sorting signals and proteins, such as the Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding proteins (GGAs) and adaptor protein complexes (AP1), which are involved in its trafficking and sorting (Ghosh2003Mannose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the M6PR gene, which encodes the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, have significant clinical implications. Disruptions in M6PR function can lead to lysosomal storage disorders, such as mucolipidosis, due to improper targeting of lysosomal enzymes (Coutinho2012Mannose6phosphate). In Fabry disease cardiomyopathy, downregulation of M6PR has been observed, with a significant reduction in myocardial M6PR expression. This downregulation is linked to the limited efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in removing accumulated substrates from cardiomyocytes, suggesting that M6PR might be polyubiquitinated and degraded in the cytoplasm (Frustaci2022Downregulation).

In Alzheimer's disease, altered levels of the IGF-II/M6P receptor, which includes the M6PR, have been associated with the pathology of the disease. Overexpression of this receptor in mouse fibroblast cell lines has been shown to alter the expression profiles of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease-related pathways, indicating that changes in M6PR expression may influence disease progression (Wang2014Overexpression). These findings underscore the importance of M6PR in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in various metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
The cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) is involved in several key interactions that facilitate its role in cellular transport processes. M6PR interacts with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (PS-ASOs), which enhances the release of these oligonucleotides from late endosomes (LEs). This interaction is crucial for the intracellular delivery of PS-ASOs, as M6PR binds to these oligonucleotides and facilitates their escape from vesicles (Liang2019Golgiendosome).

M6PR also interacts with the Golgi protein GCC2, which is necessary for the receptor's trafficking between the LEs and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). GCC2 tethers vesicles to the TGN membrane, and its reduction affects the cytoplasmic distribution of M6PR, indicating that GCC2 acts at a step preceding M6PR in the pathway (Liang2019Golgiendosome).

In addition, M6PR is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes and interacts with proteins such as GGAs and AP1. These interactions are essential for the sorting and trafficking of M6PR, preventing its degradation in lysosomes and ensuring its return to the Golgi (Ghosh2003Mannose).
