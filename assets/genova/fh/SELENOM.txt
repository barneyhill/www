# SELENOM

## Overview
SELENOM is a gene that encodes selenoprotein M, a member of the selenoprotein family characterized by the presence of selenocysteine, an amino acid encoded by the UGA codon. Selenoprotein M is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident oxidoreductase, belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily, and is involved in redox signaling and calcium homeostasis. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, where it plays a role in energy metabolism and leptin signaling. The protein's structural similarity to thioredoxin and its active site CxxU motif, where selenocysteine replaces the second cysteine, enhance its ability to mediate disulfide exchange reactions. Selenoprotein M is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ER stress responses and the unfolded protein response (UPR), and has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Gong2021Selenoprotein; Rogachev2023Molecular; Varlamova2022The).

## Structure
SELENOM (selenoprotein M) is a member of the selenoprotein family, characterized by the incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine, which is encoded by the UGA codon. This protein is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident oxidoreductase and is structurally similar to thioredoxin, containing a thioredoxin-like fold in its tertiary structure (Gong2021Selenoprotein). The active site of SELENOM features a CxxU motif, where the second cysteine is replaced by selenocysteine, enhancing its ability to mediate disulfide exchange reactions (Gong2021Selenoprotein).

SELENOM is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in various cellular processes, including redox reactions and calcium homeostasis (Rogachev2023Molecular). Its structural homology with other selenoproteins, such as SELENOF, suggests potential roles in cytoskeletal regulation, possibly involving interactions with actin filaments (Rogachev2023Molecular). The protein's localization in the ER indicates a role in calcium release regulation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Reeves2010The).

While specific post-translational modifications and quaternary structure details of SELENOM are not well-documented, its involvement in redox-sensitive pathways and ER stress responses highlights its functional significance in cellular physiology (Gong2021Selenoprotein).

## Function
Selenoprotein M (SELENOM) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident oxidoreductase that plays a crucial role in redox signaling and energy metabolism. It is structurally similar to thioredoxin and is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, a brain region involved in leptin signaling. SELENOM promotes hypothalamic leptin signaling and thioredoxin antioxidant activity, contributing to energy homeostasis and potentially influencing obesity-related mechanisms (Gong2021Selenoprotein). SELENOM enhances the activity of the thioredoxin system, which helps reduce ER stress and facilitates the activation of the NF-κB pathway, important for transcriptional regulation of target genes (Gong2021Selenoprotein).

SELENOM is characterized by a CxxC active site motif, where the second cysteine is replaced by selenocysteine, enhancing thiol-like/disulfide exchange reactions. This protein is part of the thioredoxin superfamily, which is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance (Gong2021Selenoprotein). SELENOM is involved in calcium homeostasis, as leptin-induced reduction of cytosolic Ca2+ levels is impaired in SELENOM-deficient cells (Gong2021Selenoprotein). In the context of brain cells, SELENOM is implicated in the activation of protective antioxidant mechanisms, preventing oxidative damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Varlamova2022The).

## Clinical Significance
SELENOM, a selenoprotein, plays a significant role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Alterations in SELENOM expression have been linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's, SELENOM is believed to have a protective role by reducing oxidative stress and protecting neurons. A reduction in brain SELENOM levels has been observed in mouse models of Alzheimer's, and its overexpression, along with selenium supplementation, has been shown to activate ERK signaling, which decreases tau phosphorylation and γ-secretase activity, leading to reduced mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

In the context of cancer, particularly glioblastoma, SELENOM has been shown to induce apoptosis and affect calcium homeostasis. Knockdown of SELENOM in glioblastoma cells leads to increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes, suggesting its involvement in the PERK signaling pathway. Despite this, SELENOM knockdown does not significantly affect the proliferative properties of these cancer cells, possibly due to increased antioxidant enzyme activities that counteract pro-apoptotic effects (Rogachev2023Molecular; Varlamova2022The). These findings highlight SELENOM's potential role in regulating apoptosis and ER stress in cancer cells (Rogachev2023Molecular).

## Interactions
SELENOM, a selenoprotein, is known to interact with various proteins, playing a role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and calcium homeostasis. It has been identified to potentially interact with cytoskeletal proteins, specifically β-actin and γ-actin, which are crucial for cellular processes like adhesion and migration (Rogachev2023Molecular). These interactions suggest that SELENOM may influence cellular structure and dynamics.

SELENOM is also involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. It activates the UPR IRE1α signaling pathway, which is a critical component of the cellular stress response mechanism (Rogachev2023Molecular). This interaction indicates SELENOM's role in maintaining protein homeostasis within the ER.

In the context of glioblastoma cells, SELENOM has been shown to penetrate cells via actin-dependent endocytosis, affecting the redox status and leading to ER stress and apoptosis (Rogachev2023Molecular). This suggests a dynamic interaction with cellular components that regulate endocytosis and intracellular signaling pathways.

SELENOM's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in cellular pathways highlight its potential role in modulating cellular stress responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
