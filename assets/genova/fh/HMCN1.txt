# HMCN1

## Overview
HMCN1, or hemicentin 1, is a gene that encodes a large extracellular matrix protein known as hemicentin-1. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains such as von Willebrand A (vWA), immunoglobulin (Ig), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, as well as a fibulin domain. Hemicentin-1 plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and maintaining tissue integrity, functioning as a structural component in various tissues, including the dermal-epidermal and myotendinous junctions. It is involved in processes such as cell migration, differentiation, and tissue remodeling, and is implicated in the structural organization of the basement membrane. The gene's mutations and alterations have been associated with several diseases, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma and age-related macular degeneration, highlighting its clinical significance (Gong2022Comprehensive; Xu2013Specific; Welcker2021Hemicentin1).

## Structure
Hemicentin 1 (HMCN1) is a large extracellular matrix protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. It includes several conserved domains: an amino-terminal von Willebrand A (vWA) domain, a long stretch of tandem immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, multiple tandem epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, and a fibulin domain (Welcker2021Hemicentin1). These domains contribute to the protein's role in cell adhesion and tissue integrity. The vWA domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the Ig domains are crucial for structural stability and cell adhesion (Xu2013Specific).

HMCN1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function (Lin2020Mammalian). The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Lin2020Mammalian). In mice, the molecular structure of hemicentin-1 includes a signature portion of 4473 amino acids, accounting for 80% of the gene, which is crucial for its function in hemidesmosomes involved in cell adhesion (Xu2013Specific).

HMCN1 forms discrete tracks in the extracellular matrix, particularly in collagen-rich tissues, indicating its role in structural support and tissue remodeling (Lin2020Mammalian).

## Function
Hemicentin-1 (HMCN1) is a crucial extracellular matrix protein involved in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cell adhesion. In healthy human cells, HMCN1 plays a significant role in cell-cell and cell-basement membrane adhesion, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and organs (Xu2013Specific). It is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal cells, particularly during tooth root formation, where it promotes the mineralization process necessary for dentin formation (Cui2024Hemicentin1). HMCN1 is also implicated in cell migration and adhesion, potentially through mechanisms similar to those observed in C. elegans, which may aid in the migration of dental pulp cells to the dental pulp margin for differentiation into odontoblasts (Cui2024Hemicentin1).

HMCN1 is active in various tissues, including the dermal-epidermal and myotendinous junctions, where it contributes to the structural organization of the basement membrane (Welcker2021Hemicentin1). It forms part of a network that supports the extracellular matrix, facilitating the transport of antigens and cytokines in secondary lymphoid organs (Lin2020Mammalian). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue architecture, as well as its potential role in tissue repair and regeneration.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HMCN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), HMCN1 mutations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes and alterations in metabolic pathways, such as oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism (Gong2022Comprehensive). These mutations are considered independent predictive biomarkers for overall survival in ccRCC patients (Gong2022Comprehensive).

HMCN1 is also linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although common variants in HMCN1 do not account for a significant proportion of AMD cases, rare variants may contribute to disease susceptibility in a subset of patients (Fisher2007Casecontrol). The gene's involvement in AMD is further supported by its association with specific genetic variants that may influence disease progression (Thompson2007Complement).

In glomerular diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy, increased expression of HMCN1 is observed in response to hyperglycemia and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), contributing to podocyte dysfunction and glomerular damage (Toffoli2018Hemicentin). This suggests a role for HMCN1 in the pathology of various renal diseases.

## Interactions
Hemicentin 1 (HMCN1) is a large extracellular matrix protein that participates in several physical interactions with other proteins, particularly within the basement membrane (BM). HMCN1 interacts with nidogen-2 (NID2), a basement membrane protein, through a high-affinity binding that involves the G2F-EGF domain of HMCN1 and the G3 domain of NID2. This interaction is calcium-dependent and is stronger with NID2 compared to nidogen-1 (NID1) (Zhang2021Vertebrate). The binding between HMCN1 and NID2 is suggested to be temporary, potentially acting as a chaperone during early BM assembly (Zhang2021Vertebrate).

HMCN1 also competes with laminin for binding to the G3 domain of nidogen-2, although laminin has a higher affinity for NID2. This suggests that HMCN1 is part of the nidogen-laminin-integrin network, capable of binding NID2 more quickly but less persistently than laminins (Zhang2021Vertebrate). In zebrafish models, HMCN1, NID2, and laminin cooperate in the formation and maintenance of basement membranes, contributing to tissue linkage (Zhang2021Vertebrate). These interactions highlight the role of HMCN1 in maintaining BM integrity and function across various tissues.
