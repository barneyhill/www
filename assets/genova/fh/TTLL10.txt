# TTLL10

## Overview
The TTLL10 gene encodes the enzyme tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 10, which is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family. This enzyme functions as a polyglycylase, playing a crucial role in the post-translational modification of microtubules through the elongation of polyglycine chains on tubulin proteins. Glycylation, the specific modification mediated by TTLL10, is essential for the stability and function of cilia, as it influences microtubule dynamics and interactions with associated proteins (Cummings2024The). TTLL10 operates by extending glycine chains on tubulin that have been previously monoglycylated, primarily by TTLL8, and its activity is modulated by other tubulin modifications such as glutamylation and polyglycylation (Cummings2024The). Interestingly, in humans, TTLL10 is enzymatically inactive, suggesting that its function may not be critical in mammalian systems, although it remains active in other organisms (Rocha2014Tubulin).

## Function
The TTLL10 gene encodes a polyglycylase enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of microtubules, specifically through the elongation of polyglycine chains on tubulin proteins. This modification, known as glycylation, is crucial for the maintenance and function of cilia, as it affects microtubule stability and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (Cummings2024The). TTLL10 specifically elongates glycine chains on microtubules that have already been monoglycylated by other enzymes, such as TTLL8, and does not initiate glycylation on unmodified microtubules (Cummings2024The). 

The activity of TTLL10 is regulated by other tubulin modifications; it is stimulated by tubulin glutamylation, which occurs before glycylation during cilia development, and is inhibited by polyglycylation, suggesting a self-limiting mechanism for controlling polyglycine chain length (Cummings2024The). This regulatory mechanism ensures that TTLL10 is recruited to microtubules at the appropriate stage of cilia maturation, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular structure and function (Cummings2024The). Despite its role in these processes, the absence of TTLL10 in humans is physiologically tolerated, indicating it may not be critical for basic cellular functions (Gadadhar2021Tubulin).

## Interactions
TTLL10, a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family, is involved in the post-translational modification of microtubules through glycylation. It specifically elongates polyglycine chains on tubulin that have been monoglycylated by TTLL8, indicating a sequential interaction between these enzymes (Cummings2024The). TTLL10's recruitment to microtubules is influenced by the state of tubulin modification; it is stimulated by monoglycylation and inhibited by polyglycylation, suggesting a regulatory interaction that controls polyglycine chain length (Cummings2024The). 

TTLL10 is also stimulated by tubulin glutamylation, particularly through the action of TTLL6, which adds glutamate chains to tubulin. This interaction suggests a sequential modification process where glutamylation precedes glycylation during cilia development (Cummings2024The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by these modifications, highlighting its role in the complex interplay of tubulin modifications that affect microtubule function (Cummings2024The). 

In humans, TTLL10 is enzymatically inactive, which implies that its role in glycylation may not be essential in mammals, contrasting with its active role in other organisms (Rocha2014Tubulin).
