# ZNF341

## Overview
ZNF341 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 341, a transcription factor characterized by its 12 C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are essential for DNA binding and gene regulation. The protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by regulating the expression of STAT3, a key signaling molecule involved in immune cell differentiation and function. ZNF341 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs to modulate transcriptional activity. Mutations in the ZNF341 gene can lead to impaired STAT3 expression, resulting in immune dysregulation and conditions such as hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), which is marked by elevated IgE levels and recurrent infections (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341; Béziat2018A). The protein's function underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and highlights its clinical significance in immunodeficiency disorders.

## Structure
ZNF341 is a transcription factor characterized by the presence of 12 C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability (Béziat2018A). These zinc finger domains suggest that ZNF341 can recognize specific nucleotide sequences, allowing it to regulate gene expression, including that of STAT3 (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341). The protein also contains two predicted nuclear localization sequences (NLS), which facilitate its transport into the nucleus where it exerts its function as a transcription factor (Béziat2018A).

ZNF341 is encoded by a gene with 15 exons and produces two main isoforms through alternative splicing. These isoforms differ by 21 in-frame nucleotides, resulting in proteins of 847 and 854 amino acids, respectively (Béziat2018A). The full-length isoforms are typically localized in the nucleus, but mutations can lead to truncated forms that may be retained in the cytoplasm, affecting their function (Béziat2018A).

The protein's structure is essential for its role in transcriptional regulation, as mutations that truncate the protein or affect its zinc finger domains can significantly impair its ability to bind DNA and regulate target genes (Béziat2018A).

## Function
ZNF341 is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating the expression of STAT3, a protein essential for various immune functions. In healthy human cells, ZNF341 is constitutively expressed in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs, including those in the STAT3 promoter, to modulate transcriptional activity (Béziat2018A). This binding is crucial for maintaining normal levels of STAT3 mRNA and protein, which are necessary for the differentiation and function of immune cells such as Th17 cells (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341; Béziat2018A).

ZNF341's role in immune cell differentiation is particularly significant in the development of Th17 cells, which are involved in producing cytokines like IL-17, critical for immune responses (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341). The transcription factor ensures adequate STAT3 expression, which is vital for the differentiation of naïve T cells into Th17 cells, thereby contributing to immune competence (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341). ZNF341 also influences the transcription of other genes, such as STAT1, indicating its broader role in immune regulation (Béziat2018A).

Mutations in ZNF341 can lead to impaired STAT3 expression and function, resulting in immune dysregulation and conditions like hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), characterized by elevated IgE levels and recurrent infections (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341; Béziat2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF341 gene are associated with a recessive form of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), characterized by immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, and elevated serum IgE levels. Patients with ZNF341 mutations exhibit impaired STAT3 expression and activity, which is crucial for immune function. This impairment leads to a deficiency in Th17 cell differentiation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of HIES, such as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and staphylococcal infections (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341; Béziat2018A).

ZNF341 mutations result in truncated proteins that fail to translocate to the nucleus, disrupting their ability to activate the STAT3 promoter. This leads to insufficient STAT3 levels, similar to the effects seen in patients with dominant-negative STAT3 mutations (FreyJakobs2018ZNF341). The deficiency in STAT3 affects various immune cells, including monocytes, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and B cells, impairing their function and contributing to the disease phenotype (Béziat2018A).

Patients with ZNF341 deficiency also show an imbalance in Th2 and Th17 cell responses, with enhanced Th2 responses leading to severe allergies and a stronger inflammatory response during infections (Béziat2018A). These findings underscore the critical role of ZNF341 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its clinical significance in immunodeficiency disorders.

## Interactions
ZNF341 is a transcription factor that interacts with specific DNA motifs to regulate gene expression. It binds to the STAT3 promoter in T and B cells, playing a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of STAT3, a key signaling molecule in immune responses (Béziat2018A). ZNF341 recognizes a bipartite DNA motif in the STAT3 promoter, with its binding facilitated by two motifs: a ZNF-like motif and an Sp1-like motif. The ZNF-like motif is particularly critical for binding, although both motifs work synergistically to enhance ZNF341's DNA binding ability (Béziat2018A).

Mutations in ZNF341, such as R302X, K355fs, and Y542X, disrupt its ability to bind effectively to DNA, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and pulldown experiments (Béziat2018A). These mutations lead to a loss of function, affecting the transcriptional activation of STAT3 and contributing to immune-related disorders like hyper-IgE syndrome (Béziat2018A).

While ZNF341's direct interactions with other proteins, such as STAT3, have not been detected, its role as a transcriptional activator suggests it may interact with other transcriptional machinery components to regulate gene expression (Béziat2018A).
