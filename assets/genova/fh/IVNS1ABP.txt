# IVNS1ABP

## Overview
The IVNS1ABP gene encodes the influenza virus NS1A binding protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in cellular RNA processing and regulation. As a member of the Kelch protein superfamily, it is characterized by a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and a Kelch domain, which facilitate its interactions with various cellular components (Perconti2007The; Guo2018Crystal). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in mRNA splicing and export, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Othumpangat2013Expression). IVNS1ABP also interacts with the influenza virus NS1 protein, influencing viral replication and host immune response (Othumpangat2013Expression). Additionally, it plays a role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing actin filaments and protecting cells from structural damage (Othumpangat2013Expression). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and the pathogenesis of viral infections.

## Structure
The IVNS1ABP protein, also known as NS1-binding protein (NS1-BP), is a member of the Kelch protein superfamily and is characterized by several distinct domains. It contains a BTB/POZ domain at the N-terminus, a BACK domain, and a Kelch domain at the C-terminus (Perconti2007The; Guo2018Crystal). The Kelch domain, which is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions, has been structurally characterized to reveal a six-bladed β-propeller fold structure, with each blade consisting of four antiparallel β-strands (Guo2018Crystal). This domain is essential for the protein's interaction with other cellular components, such as actin and alpha-enolase (Perconti2007The).

The primary structure of NS1-BP consists of 642 amino acids, with the C-terminal portion containing six canonical Kelch repeats (Perconti2007The). The protein's interaction with alpha-enolase is mediated by the amino acid sequence from 277 to 347, which is crucial for binding (Perconti2007The). NS1-BP is involved in various cellular functions, including pre-mRNA splicing and regulation of gene expression, and it interacts with RNA-binding proteins and viral polymerases, indicating its role in RNA processing and viral life cycles (Tsai2013Cellular).

## Function
The IVNS1ABP gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing and regulation within healthy human cells. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it is involved in mRNA splicing and export, contributing to the regulation of gene expression. IVNS1ABP interacts with the influenza virus NS1 protein, which can influence viral replication, but in the absence of viral infection, it is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress (Othumpangat2013Expression).

IVNS1ABP is concentrated in the intra-nuclear domain, an area enriched with multiple splicing factors, indicating its involvement in the splicing process (Othumpangat2013Expression). The protein also plays a role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by stabilizing actin filaments through its association with F-actin via Kelch repeats. This function is essential for protecting cells from actin filament damage and preventing cell death induced by actin-destabilizing agents (Othumpangat2013Expression). These activities highlight the importance of IVNS1ABP in cellular processes that ensure proper cell division and structural integrity, which are vital for normal cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
IVNS1ABP, also known as the influenza virus NS1A binding protein, interacts with the influenza A virus non-structural protein-1 (NS1). This interaction is crucial for the virus's ability to inhibit host immune responses, such as interferon production, and to enhance viral mRNA translation. NS1ABP is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and 3′ end processing, which affects the nuclear export of cellular mRNAs (Othumpangat2013Expression). 

NS1ABP also plays a role in stabilizing actin filaments, protecting cells from actin filament damage, and is involved in cell division and the organization of the actin skeleton (Othumpangat2013Expression). During influenza infection, NS1ABP is re-localized from its normal intra-nuclear domain, potentially altering its functional role (Othumpangat2013Expression). 

In addition to its interactions with viral proteins, IVNS1ABP is associated with the L1 ORF1p complex, a component of human retrotransposition machinery. This association was identified through mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation studies, suggesting a role in the regulation of retrotransposition (Goodier2013Mapping). The presence of IVNS1ABP in cytoplasmic granules, such as stress granules and P-bodies, indicates potential interactions with RNA-binding proteins (Goodier2013Mapping).
