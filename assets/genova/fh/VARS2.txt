# VARS2

## Overview
The VARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase 2, a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for the attachment of valine to its corresponding tRNA, a crucial step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, which are essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (Kayvanpour2022VARS2; Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations). The protein structure of valyl-tRNA synthetase 2 includes distinct functional domains that facilitate its catalytic and tRNA binding activities (Chin2019A). Mutations in the VARS2 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions, manifesting in various clinical conditions such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathies and cardiomyopathies (Begliuomini2019VARS2linked; Chin2019A). The enzyme's ubiquitous expression, particularly in energy-demanding tissues, underscores its critical role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Kayvanpour2022VARS2).

## Structure
The VARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of valine to its corresponding tRNA. The protein structure includes two functional domains: an N-terminal domain with catalytic and editing activity, and a C-terminal tRNA binding domain (Chin2019A). The enzyme is part of the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which typically feature a Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold, important for binding ATP and stabilizing intermediates (Chin2019A).

Mutations in the VARS2 gene can affect these structural domains, leading to mitochondrial disorders. For instance, the Arg773Gln mutation is located in the class Ia anticodon-binding region, which is highly conserved and critical for enzyme-tRNAVal binding (Chin2019A). The Thr647Met mutation affects the Rossmann-like fold, potentially destabilizing ATP binding (Chin2019A).

VARS2 is expressed ubiquitously, with higher expression in tissues with high energy turnover, such as the cerebellum and left ventricle. The most abundant protein-coding isoform in human left ventricles is Isoform 1, consisting of 29 coding exons and 1066 amino acids (Kayvanpour2022VARS2).

## Function
The VARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for the ligation of valine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins necessary for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations). In healthy human cells, VARS2 ensures the proper functioning of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) by facilitating the correct translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Kayvanpour2022VARS2).

VARS2 is involved in the formation of supercomplexes within the electron transport chain, which enhances electron transport efficiency and prevents complex destabilization (Kayvanpour2022VARS2). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, as it supports oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, impacting cellular energy metabolism (Chin2019A). VARS2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, including those with high energy demands such as the cerebellum and heart, highlighting its role in energy-intensive processes (Kayvanpour2022VARS2).

Disruptions in VARS2 function can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production (Kayvanpour2022VARS2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VARS2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders. These include mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, cardiomyopathies, and other systemic conditions. Patients with VARS2 mutations often present with symptoms such as developmental delay, hypotonia, spasticity, epilepsy, and pulmonary hypertension (Begliuomini2019VARS2linked; Kušíková2021Case; Chin2019A). 

Specific mutations, such as the c.1100C>T (p.Thr367Ile) variant, have been linked to mitochondrial encephalopathy, characterized by developmental delays, cerebellar atrophy, and seizures (Begliuomini2019VARS2linked). Other mutations, like c.2318G>A (p.Arg773Gln) and c.1940C>T (p.Thr647Met), have been associated with lactic acidosis and failure to thrive, which can be managed with dietary interventions (Chin2019A). 

In some cases, VARS2 mutations lead to severe early-onset conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hyperlactatemia, resulting in early mortality (Kušíková2021Case). The clinical manifestations of VARS2 mutations are diverse, reflecting the gene's critical role in mitochondrial function and protein synthesis. These mutations can cause significant disruptions in oxidative phosphorylation, leading to the observed clinical phenotypes (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations).

## Interactions
The VARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of valine to its corresponding tRNA. This enzyme is involved in interactions with mitochondrial tRNA, particularly in regions crucial for the interaction of the VARS2 protein with cognate tRNA. Mutations in the VARS2 gene, such as c.643 C > T (p.His215Tyr) and c.1354 A > G (p.Met452Val), are located in highly conserved regions important for these interactions, potentially impacting the enzyme's function and stability (Ma2018A).

In yeast models, the human VARS2 protein has been shown to interact with mitochondrial translation machinery components, such as ribosomal proteins and other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, to facilitate efficient translation and mitochondrial function. The expression of human VARS2 in yeast can be toxic, possibly due to protein folding issues or interactions with other proteins, indicating a complex interaction network within the mitochondrial environment (Chin2019A).

The VARS2 protein's interactions are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, and disruptions in these interactions due to mutations can lead to mitochondrial disorders, as evidenced by studies on yeast models and human clinical cases (Montanari2010AminoacyltRNA).
