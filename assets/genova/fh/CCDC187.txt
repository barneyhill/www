# CCDC187

## Overview
CCDC187 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 187, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC187 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. Although the precise biological functions of CCDC187 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer, where it is up-regulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This up-regulation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential significance in cancer biology and as a therapeutic target (Huang2023HighThroughput).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CCDC187 has been identified as a gene with altered expression in colorectal cancer (COAD). In a study analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in normal and COAD tissues, CCDC187 was found to be up-regulated in COAD tissues compared to normal tissues. This up-regulation was associated with a poorer survival prognosis for patients with high expression levels of these DEGs, including CCDC187, suggesting a potential link between its expression and survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients (Huang2023HighThroughput).

The study also investigated the effects of rotundine, a compound that targets these DEGs, including CCDC187, to inhibit colorectal cancer. It was observed that CCDC187 was down-regulated in SW480 cells after rotundine treatment, indicating that this gene might be a target of rotundine's action in inhibiting cancer progression (Huang2023HighThroughput). The coordinated regulation of CCDC187 and other DEGs by rotundine suggests its involvement in various signaling pathways and biological processes related to cancer progression. These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC187 in colorectal cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target. However, specific mutations in CCDC187 and their direct link to other diseases or conditions are not well-documented.
