# LHFPL2

## Overview
LHFPL2 is a gene that encodes the LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 2, a tetra-transmembrane protein belonging to the LHFP gene family. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and membrane organization, which are crucial for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and function (Zhao2016Novel). LHFPL2 is expressed in multiple tissues, with notable expression in the reproductive system, where it plays a significant role in the development and differentiation of reproductive ducts (Zhao2016Novel). The protein's involvement in reproductive tract development is particularly evident in murine models, where mutations can lead to reproductive abnormalities (Zhao2016Novel). Additionally, LHFPL2 has been associated with various pathological conditions, including renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for tumor progression and prognosis (Chong2022PIK3CA; Gong2024LHFPL2).

## Function
The LHFPL2 gene encodes a tetra-transmembrane protein that is part of the LHFP gene family, which includes proteins predicted to have four transmembrane domains. This protein is involved in cellular processes such as cell signaling and membrane organization, contributing to the structural integrity and function of cellular membranes (Zhao2016Novel). LHFPL2 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the reproductive system, including the ovary, uterus, and vagina (Zhao2016Novel). 

In the context of reproductive development, LHFPL2 plays a crucial role in the proper merging phase of the reproductive tract, which is essential for the extension and differentiation of reproductive ducts. This function is particularly important in the development of the distal reproductive tract in both male and female mice, where mutations in LHFPL2 can lead to significant reproductive tract abnormalities (Zhao2016Novel). The protein is localized in the epithelium of the vas deferens, suggesting its involvement in sperm transport (Zhao2016Novel). 

While the specific role of LHFPL2 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the available context, its involvement in cellular signaling and structural integrity suggests a potential role in similar processes in humans.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LHFPL2 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In renal cell carcinoma, particularly kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), LHFPL2 is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is associated with poor overall survival and advanced-stage tumors, suggesting that LHFPL2 may influence tumor progression and aggressiveness, making it a potential biomarker for this cancer type (Gong2024LHFPL2). 

In colorectal cancer, the circular RNA derived from LHFPL2, known as circLHFPL2, is downregulated in cells with PIK3CA mutations. This downregulation is linked to poor prognosis and is thought to inhibit cancer progression by upregulating PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, through interactions with specific microRNAs (Chong2022PIK3CA).

In mice, a point mutation in LHFPL2 (G102E) leads to significant reproductive tract malformations, resulting in infertility. In females, this mutation causes vaginal agenesis, while in males, it results in distal vas deferens convolution and ejaculatory duct obstruction. These defects are due to the failed fusion of reproductive ducts with the urogenital sinus (Zhao2016Novel).
