# HERC6

## Overview
HERC6 is a gene that encodes the protein HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 6, which is part of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a HECT domain at the C-terminus, responsible for transferring ubiquitin to substrate proteins, and an RCC1-like domain (RLD) at the N-terminus, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Hochrainer2005The; SánchezTena2016Functional). HERC6 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the testis and brain, and is localized in the cytoplasm associated with membranous structures (SánchezTena2016Functional). The protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, impacting various cellular functions such as protein degradation, receptor internalization, and signal transduction (Hochrainer2005The). Notably, HERC6 is involved in intrinsic immunity, contributing to antiviral defense mechanisms by inhibiting viral replication, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided).

## Structure
HERC6 is a small member of the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a single RCC1-like domain (RLD) at the N-terminus and a HECT domain at the C-terminus (Hochrainer2005The; SánchezTena2016Functional). The RLD is known for its seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and may play a role in antiviral activity (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). The HECT domain is responsible for the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, a key function in protein degradation and regulation (SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC6 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can lead to truncated proteins or proteins with internal deletions (Hochrainer2005The; SánchezTena2016Functional). These splice variants can affect the protein's structure and function, potentially altering its role as a ubiquitin ligase (Hochrainer2005The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the testis and brain, and is localized in the cytoplasm associated with membranous structures (SánchezTena2016Functional). While specific post-translational modifications are not detailed, the presence of a HECT domain suggests potential ubiquitination activity.

## Function
HERC6 is a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family, characterized by the presence of a HECT domain at the C-terminus and an RCC1-like domain at the N-terminus. It is involved in the ubiquitination process, which is critical for various cellular functions such as protein degradation, receptor internalization, signal transduction, and cell cycle regulation (Hochrainer2005The). HERC6 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the testis and brain, and is localized in the cytoplasm associated with membranous structures (SánchezTena2016Functional).

In humans, HERC6 is thought to play a minor role in ISG15 conjugation compared to HERC5, although it is the major ISG15 E3 ligase in mice, indicating a significant role in ISGylation and antiviral activity (SánchezTena2016Functional). The protein is involved in intrinsic immunity by inhibiting the replication of viruses, including HIV-1, although its effectiveness may vary depending on the virus (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). HERC6 is evolving under strong positive selection, particularly in its RCC1-like domain, suggesting its importance in antiviral defense mechanisms (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). Despite its roles in antiviral activity, the specific function of HERC6 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
HERC6, a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family, plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses and has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In the context of inflammation, HERC6 is involved in the ISGylation of NLRP3, a process that stabilizes the protein and enhances inflammasome activation. Deficiency in HERC6 has been shown to ameliorate NLRP3-dependent inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition that can be fatal in COVID-19 patients (Qin2023Posttranslational).

Alterations in HERC6 expression have also been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where its up-regulation promotes inflammation (zhang2024The). In multiple myeloma, HERC6 is identified as a highly expressed gene in high-risk groups, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (zhang2024The). Additionally, HERC6 has been noted for its involvement in neurodevelopment and cancer, acting variably as a cancer-promoting factor or tumor suppressor depending on the cancer type (zhang2024The).

In the context of viral infections, HERC6 influences immune responses by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can impact the severity of conditions characterized by excessive inflammation (Qin2023Posttranslational).
