# CCDC125

## Overview
CCDC125 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 125, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell motility. This protein is characterized by the presence of four coiled-coil domains and is predominantly expressed in immune-related tissues, such as the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow (Nakajima2009Role). Functionally, CCDC125 interacts with the RhoGTPase family of proteins, including RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42, which are essential for actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cell movement. By modulating the activity of these proteins, CCDC125 influences various physiological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, and immune-cell trafficking (Nakajima2009Role). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal health. Additionally, CCDC125 has been implicated in several diseases, including neuroblastoma and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Bacchelli2015Analysis; Currie2024A).

## Function
CCDC125, also known as Kenae, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell motility through its interaction with the RhoGTPase family of proteins. This protein contains four coiled-coil domains and is expressed in various tissues, with particularly high expression in immune-related tissues such as the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow (Nakajima2009Role). 

CCDC125 modulates the activity of RhoGTPase proteins, including RhoA, Rac1, and cdc42, which are crucial for actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cell movement. In cells expressing CCDC125, the active forms of these proteins are detectable even without stimulation, and their activity levels are lower compared to control cells after stimulation. This suggests that CCDC125 represses cellular motility by affecting the activity of these RhoGTPase family members (Nakajima2009Role). 

The protein's role in cell motility is significant for various physiological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, and immune-cell trafficking (Nakajima2009Role). While its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in these critical cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC125 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, CCDC125 is part of a 17-gene signature associated with prognosis. While its role in neuroblastoma is not fully characterized, its upregulation is paradoxically linked to poor prognosis, contrasting with its positive prognostic value in gastric and thyroid cancers, suggesting tissue-specific functions (Currie2024A).

In the context of neurological disorders, CCDC125 is associated with impaired motor neuron function in Isaac's Syndrome due to its involvement in delaying cell motility and dysregulating RhoGTPase pathways (Currie2024A). Additionally, a rare maternal gain involving CCDC125 was identified in a study on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although specific diseases or conditions associated with mutations in CCDC125 were not detailed (Bacchelli2015Analysis).

In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CCDC125 expression negatively correlates with drug response, particularly to daunorubicin (DNR), indicating its potential role in drug resistance (Cucchi2020Harnessing). These findings suggest that CCDC125 may serve as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in various diseases.
