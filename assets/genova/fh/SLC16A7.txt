# SLC16A7

## Overview
SLC16A7 is a gene that encodes the protein monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), a member of the solute carrier family 16. MCT2 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices, which facilitate the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate across cell membranes (Halestrap2013The; Bosshart2019Mechanistic). This transporter is particularly significant in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis and the lactate shuttle mechanism (Yu2020Comprehensive; Meredith2008The). MCT2's function is dependent on its interaction with glycoproteins like embigin and basigin, which are essential for its proper localization and activity at the plasma membrane (Halestrap2011The). The gene's involvement in metabolic processes and its potential implications in clinical conditions, such as cancer and metabolic acidosis, underscore its importance in human health (Nowik2008Genomewide; White2023What).

## Structure
The SLC16A7 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), a member of the SLC16 solute carrier family. MCT2 is characterized by its structure, which includes 12 transmembrane helices with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Halestrap2013The; Halestrap2011The). This topology is typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), to which MCT2 belongs (Bosshart2019Mechanistic). The protein's structure is likely similar to that of MCT1, which has been extensively studied and modeled in both 'closed' and 'open' conformations, providing insights into its translocation mechanism (Halestrap2013The).

MCT2 is not glycosylated, but it requires association with glycosylated ancillary proteins, such as embigin, for proper localization to the plasma membrane (Halestrap2011The). The protein's high affinity for L-lactate and its role in L-lactate uptake are facilitated by its structural features, which are conserved across the SLC16 family (Bosshart2019Mechanistic). Although specific structural details for SLC16A7 are not fully elucidated, the conserved nature of the family suggests that MCT2 shares similar structural features with other family members (Halestrap2013The).

## Function
SLC16A7, also known as monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), is involved in the proton-coupled transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate across cell membranes. It exhibits a higher affinity for pyruvate and lactate compared to MCT1, another member of the monocarboxylate transporter family (Halestrap2004The; Meredith2008The). MCT2 is primarily expressed in neurons, liver, and kidney, where it facilitates the uptake or efflux of L-lactate depending on the metabolic needs of the tissue (Yu2020Comprehensive). 

In the brain, MCT2 is located in neurons and plays a role in the lactate shuttle mechanism, facilitating the transfer of lactate between neurons and astrocytes, which is crucial for energy metabolism (Meredith2008The). MCT2 requires association with the ancillary protein embigin for correct translocation to the plasma membrane, which is essential for its activity (Halestrap2011The). The transporter is not glycosylated but relies on glycosylated ancillary proteins for its function (Halestrap2013The). MCT2's role in metabolite transport is significant for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and supporting metabolic processes in tissues with high energy demands.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC16A7 gene, encoding the monocarboxylate transporter MCT2, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular metabolism. Alterations in the expression or mutation of SLC16A7 have been associated with cancer development and progression. Specifically, a germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLC16A7, rs995343, is linked to adverse outcomes in colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers, suggesting that changes in this gene may influence cancer progression by affecting cell growth and division (White2023What).

In the context of metabolic acidosis, SLC16A7 expression is regulated in the kidneys, indicating its involvement in the body's response to acid-base disturbances. A study showed a fold change of 1.56 in SLC16A7 expression after two days of induced metabolic acidosis in mice, highlighting its role in renal adaptation to acid load (Nowik2008Genomewide).

While SLC16A7 has been screened for variations potentially associated with epilepsy, no direct link has been established. The gene is predicted to be tolerant to functional change, with identified polymorphisms not linked to specific diseases (Hildebrand2014Glucose). Overall, SLC16A7's involvement in disease primarily relates to its role in metabolic processes and cancer.

## Interactions
SLC16A7, also known as MCT2, is involved in the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate across cell membranes. For its proper function and localization at the plasma membrane, SLC16A7 requires interaction with the glycoproteins basigin (BSG) or embigin (EMB). These proteins have a single transmembrane domain and multiple extracellular immunoglobulin domains, which are crucial for the correct expression and activity of SLC16A7 (Halestrap2013The). The interaction with basigin is particularly important for the transporter's role in various metabolic pathways, including energy metabolism in tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart (Halestrap2013The).

In preimplantation mouse embryos, SLC16A7 is localized primarily to the plasma membrane and is associated with peroxisomes, suggesting a role in redox regulation. The presence of SLC16A7 in peroxisomes is indicated by its colocalization with the peroxisomal marker catalase (CAT) (Jansen2008Characterization). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond basigin and embigin are not detailed, the interaction with these chaperones is essential for SLC16A7's function in cellular metabolism (Jansen2008Characterization).
