# CCDC13

## Overview
CCDC13 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 13, which is categorized as a centriolar satellite protein. This protein is integral to maintaining genome stability and promoting ciliogenesis, processes essential for proper cellular function and organization. CCDC13 interacts with key proteins such as PCM1, Cep290, and pericentrin, which are vital for microtubule organization and centrosome function (Staples2014Ccdc13). The protein's localization to centriolar satellites and the centriolar core is dependent on microtubule integrity and the dynein-dynactin transport system (Staples2014Ccdc13). Through its involvement in preventing DNA damage during mitosis and facilitating DNA repair in the G1 phase, CCDC13 contributes to genome stability (Staples2014Ccdc13). Additionally, it plays a role in ciliogenesis by aiding in the recruitment of proteins necessary for cilia formation, underscoring its significance in cellular structural organization (Staples2014Ccdc13).

## Function
CCDC13 is a human gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and promoting ciliogenesis. The protein is a centriolar satellite protein that interacts with other proteins such as PCM1, Cep290, and pericentrin, which are essential for microtubule organization and centrosome function (Staples2014Ccdc13). CCDC13 localizes to the centriolar core and centriolar satellites, depending on its expression levels, and its localization is dependent on intact microtubules and the dynein-dynactin transport system (Staples2014Ccdc13).

In healthy cells, CCDC13 is involved in preventing DNA damage during mitosis and facilitating repair in the G1 phase, contributing to genome stability (Staples2014Ccdc13). It is also implicated in ciliogenesis, where it aids in the recruitment of proteins necessary for cilia formation, such as BBS4, although it does not directly interact with BBS4 (Staples2014Ccdc13). CCDC13's role in ciliogenesis is supported by its localization to the basal body of primary cilia and its interaction with proteins that promote ciliogenesis (Staples2014Ccdc13). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular structural organization and function.
