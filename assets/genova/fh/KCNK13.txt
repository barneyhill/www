# KCNK13

## Overview
KCNK13 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 13, also known as THIK-1. This protein is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. THIK-1 is characterized by its four transmembrane regions and two pore-forming domains, forming a domain-swapped homodimer structure. It is involved in various physiological processes, including neuronal signaling, muscle contraction, and renal potassium handling. The protein's structure includes unique features such as a 'Y-gate' and a 'K2P modulator pocket,' which are important for its regulatory functions (Rajan2001THIK1; Rödström2024CryoEM). KCNK13 is expressed in several tissues, including the kidney and heart, where it contributes to processes like potassium ion recirculation and action potential repolarization (Staudacher2019Cardiac; Theilig2008Cellular). Alterations in KCNK13 expression have been linked to conditions such as breast cancer and atrial fibrillation, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain; Zou2022Integrative).

## Structure
The KCNK13 gene encodes the THIK-1 protein, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The protein consists of 405 amino acids and features four transmembrane regions and two pore-forming domains, which are characteristic of K2P channels (Rajan2001THIK1). The THIK-1 channel forms a domain-swapped homodimer, with each subunit containing two selectivity filter motifs and two extracellular cap-forming helices (Rödström2024CryoEM). A unique structural feature of THIK-1 is the presence of a lower 'Y-gate', formed by the interaction of bulky side chains on the M2 and M4 helices, particularly involving a tyrosine residue (Y273) and an isoleucine residue (I139) (Rödström2024CryoEM).

The protein also includes a large extracellular linker and a larger C terminus, with several putative phosphorylation and glycosylation sites, indicating potential regulatory roles through post-translational modifications (Rajan2001THIK1). The structure of THIK-1 reveals a lipid bound within a 'K2P modulator pocket' adjacent to the selectivity filter, which may influence channel regulation (Rödström2024CryoEM). The KCNK13 gene is located on human chromosome 14q24.1-14q24.3 (Rajan2001THIK1).

## Function
The KCNK13 gene encodes the K2P13.1 (THIK-1) channel, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K+) channel family. These channels are integral to maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. In healthy human cells, K2P13.1 channels are involved in various physiological processes, including neuronal signaling and muscle contraction, by facilitating the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane (Rajan2001THIK1).

In the kidney, K2P13.1 channels are expressed in the proximal tubule, thick ascending limb, and cortical collecting duct, where they play a role in potassium ion recirculation and secretion, contributing to the regulation of renal potassium handling (Theilig2008Cellular). These channels are thought to function as dimers and are regulated by factors such as extracellular pH, mechanical stress, and temperature differences (Theilig2008Cellular).

In the cardiac context, K2P13.1 channels are primarily expressed in the atria and are involved in action potential repolarization, which is crucial for maintaining normal atrial function. Their expression is modulated in conditions such as atrial fibrillation, indicating their role in atrial electrophysiology (Staudacher2019Cardiac).

## Clinical Significance
KCNK13, also known as TASK-4, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, KCNK13 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is confirmed in human breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3, indicating a potential role in cancer progression. However, breast cancer patients with metastatic disease exhibit low expression of KCNK13, suggesting a complex role in cancer metastasis and progression (Zou2022Integrative).

In the context of cardiac health, reduced KCNK13 mRNA levels have been observed in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure. This suggests that KCNK13 may play a role in atrial electrophysiology and could be involved in the pathogenesis of AF (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain). The gene's expression in myocardial tissue, particularly in the atria, supports its potential involvement in cardiac conditions (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of KCNK13 mutations remains incompletely explored, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in these diseases (Staudacher2019Cloning).
