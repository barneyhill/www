# ZC3HAV1L

## Overview
ZC3HAV1L is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger CCCH-type containing, antiviral 1 like, which is characterized by its zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding nucleic acids, suggesting a role in gene regulation and antiviral responses. The protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein, which is a type of protein known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and RNA binding. ZC3HAV1L has been studied for its expression patterns in different types of cancer, where it has been identified as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and progression (Huang2021Expression; Wang2022A). Its involvement in immune-related pathways further underscores its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Dong2020Immune).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZC3HAV1L has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression levels. In cervical cancer, ZC3HAV1L is significantly upregulated in advanced stages, and higher expression levels are associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Huang2021Expression). Similarly, in prostate cancer, ZC3HAV1L has been identified as a prognostic marker, with its expression levels contributing to risk prediction models for patient survival (Wang2022A).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype (NK-AML), ZC3HAV1L is part of a prognostic risk model based on immune-related genes. This model stratifies patients into high- and low-risk groups, indicating that ZC3HAV1L expression may influence disease prognosis and could guide therapeutic strategies (Dong2020Immune).

While the specific mutations in ZC3HAV1L and their direct clinical implications are not detailed, its expression levels and potential interactions in various cancers highlight its significance as a biomarker. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which ZC3HAV1L influences these diseases and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.
