# UQCRHL

## Overview
The UQCRHL gene encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein-like, which is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is involved in the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it plays a crucial role in the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a key step in cellular energy production. The UQCRHL protein is categorized as a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, also known as cytochrome bc1 complex. Its function is essential for maintaining efficient energy metabolism and cellular respiration. Mutations or dysregulation of the UQCRHL gene may have implications in various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
