# KLRG1

## Overview
KLRG1, or killer cell lectin-like receptor G1, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the C-type lectin-like receptor family. The KLRG1 protein plays a pivotal role in immune regulation by acting as an inhibitory receptor on subsets of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. It features an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain that facilitates interaction with classical cadherins, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic domain of KLRG1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), crucial for its inhibitory function by recruiting phosphatases like SHIP-1 and SHP-2 upon phosphorylation. This receptor is known to form disulfide-linked dimers, which is its predominant quaternary structure in humans, and undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. KLRG1's interactions and structural features are significant for its role in immune homeostasis, making it a potential therapeutic target in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (Tessmer2007KLRG1; Zhang2024The; Rosshart2008Interaction).

## Structure
The KLRG1 protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the C-type lectin-like receptor family. It features an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain, which is crucial for its interaction with ligands such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin (Tessmer2007KLRG1; Zhang2024The). The protein's cytoplasmic domain contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is essential for its inhibitory function by recruiting phosphatases like SHIP-1 and SHP-2 upon phosphorylation (Tessmer2007KLRG1; Rosshart2008Interaction).

KLRG1 is known to form disulfide-linked dimers in humans, which is its predominant quaternary structure (Zhang2024The; Hofmann2012Different). This dimerization is facilitated by cysteine residues, although human KLRG1 lacks the Cys 62 found in its mouse counterpart, which affects its oligomerization pattern (Hofmann2012Different). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which influences its molecular weight and function (Zhang2024The; Corral2000NK). These structural features are significant for KLRG1's role in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024The).

## Function
KLRG1 (killer cell lectin-like receptor G1) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on subsets of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, playing a crucial role in immune regulation. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, which is essential for its inhibitory function. KLRG1 interacts with members of the classical cadherin family, including E-, N-, and R-cadherins, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion. This interaction inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting a regulatory role in preventing damage to tissues expressing these cadherins (Banh2009Immunoregulatory; Ito2006Killer).

KLRG1 is expressed on mature and recently activated NK cells, effector/memory T cells, and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Its expression increases during infections, where it inhibits NK-cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and antigen-induced T-cell division (Banh2009Immunoregulatory). The binding of KLRG1 to E-cadherin can modulate immune responses by enhancing anti-inflammatory signals and reducing proinflammatory signals, thereby exerting immunosuppressive effects (Banh2009Immunoregulatory). This interaction also leads to the phosphorylation of cadherins, which can influence cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Banh2009Immunoregulatory). Through these mechanisms, KLRG1 contributes to immune homeostasis and the regulation of immune cell activity.

## Clinical Significance
KLRG1 (killer cell lectin-like receptor G1) has significant clinical implications in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KLRG1 is notably downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression of KLRG1 is associated with better overall survival and improved responses to PD1-targeting immunotherapies like pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Conversely, low KLRG1 expression correlates with poor responses to immune-checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes and responses to immunotherapy in LUAD (Yang2021Functions).

In autoimmune diseases, KLRG1 expression is increased in NK and T-cell subsets, correlating with disease severity in conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This suggests a role in disease progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024The).

A specific 3'UTR polymorphism in the KLRG1 gene, rs1805672, affects its mRNA levels by disrupting a miR-584-5p binding site. This polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility to pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune skin condition, indicating that genetic variations in KLRG1 can influence disease risk (Cipolla2016A).

## Interactions
KLRG1 (killer cell lectin-like receptor G1) is an inhibitory receptor that interacts with classical cadherins, primarily E-cadherin and N-cadherin. These interactions are crucial for regulating immune responses by inhibiting the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. KLRG1 binds to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of E-cadherin, a site that overlaps with the region responsible for cell-cell adhesion (Li2009Structure). The interaction is characterized by a relatively small interface but high shape complementarity, involving hydrophobic contacts and conserved hydrogen bonds (Li2009Structure).

KLRG1 can form multimeric complexes, such as dimers, trimers, and tetramers, which enhance its binding affinity to E-cadherin. This multimerization is necessary for effective interaction, as monomeric KLRG1 does not show detectable binding (Rosshart2008Interaction). The receptor's ability to form both covalently and non-covalently linked multimers suggests a complex regulatory mechanism for its inhibitory function (Rosshart2008Interaction).

KLRG1's interaction with E-cadherin is significant in the context of tumor progression, as E-cadherin downregulation is common in carcinomas. This interaction may play a role in tumor immunosurveillance by inhibiting the lysis of E-cadherin-expressing cells (Li2009Structure).
