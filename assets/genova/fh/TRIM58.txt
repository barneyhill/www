# TRIM58

## Overview
TRIM58 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 58, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. This family is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The TRIM58 protein plays a significant role in the ubiquitination process, tagging proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein levels. It is particularly involved in erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells, and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. TRIM58's interactions with other proteins influence cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in several cancer types by modulating key signaling pathways (Li2024TRIM58; Liu2019TRIM58; Yuan2020TRIM58).

## Structure
TRIM58 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination process, which often leads to protein degradation via the 26S proteasome (Venuto2019E3; Zhan2021TRIM). The RING domain is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, while the B-box domains, which are zinc-binding motifs, may influence substrate specificity and E3 ligase activity (Zhan2021TRIM). The coiled-coil domain, typically around 100 residues long, aids in protein interactions and subcellular localization (Zhan2021TRIM).

TRIM58, like other TRIM proteins, may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which can affect its function and stability (Venuto2019E3). Although specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of TRIM58 are not provided, the presence of these conserved domains suggests a structural framework common to TRIM family proteins, which supports their diverse roles in cellular processes (Venuto2019E3; Zhan2021TRIM).

## Function
TRIM58 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, tagging specific proteins for degradation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein levels within the cell (Liu2019TRIM58). TRIM58 is particularly active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis by modulating signaling pathways such as the β-catenin pathway in gastric cancer cells (Liu2019TRIM58). 

In healthy human cells, TRIM58 is involved in erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells, by regulating the degradation of proteins during erythroid maturation. This function is critical for ensuring the proper development and function of red blood cells (Liu2019TRIM58). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and its role in ubiquitination highlight its importance in cellular regulation and the maintenance of genomic integrity. By controlling the degradation of specific proteins, TRIM58 helps to prevent the accumulation of damaged or unnecessary proteins, thereby contributing to cellular health and function.

## Clinical Significance
TRIM58 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TRIM58 is frequently downregulated due to promoter methylation, which is associated with higher tumor grade and poor patient survival. This methylation leads to reduced TRIM58 expression, promoting cell proliferation and migration (Gan2021Silencing). In gastric cancer, TRIM58 expression is significantly reduced, and its overexpression suppresses tumor growth by inactivating β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Liu2019TRIM58). 

In colorectal cancer, TRIM58 downregulation is linked to enhanced cell invasion and poor prognosis. It inhibits cancer cell invasion by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression (Eberhardt2020Multifaceted; Liu2018Downregulation). In triple-negative breast cancer, low TRIM58 expression correlates with advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes. Its overexpression reduces cell viability and proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024TRIM58). 

TRIM58 is also frequently silenced by promoter methylation in lung adenocarcinoma, contributing to tumor progression (Kajiura2016Frequent). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TRIM58 in cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
TRIM58, a member of the TRIM protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression. In osteosarcoma cells, TRIM58 interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key player in cancer metabolism. This interaction is thought to inhibit PKM2 activity by enhancing its polyubiquitination, thereby affecting glycolysis and reducing tumorigenicity (Yuan2020TRIM58).

In triple-negative breast cancer stem cells (TNBC CSCs), TRIM58 interacts with MYH9, promoting its degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction influences the GRK3-Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining stemness and differentiation in cancer stem cells. The degradation of MYH9 by TRIM58 leads to decreased levels of stemness-related genes and increased differentiation-related genes, thereby reducing the tumorigenic capacity of CSCs (Li2024TRIM58).

In colorectal cancer, TRIM58 promotes the ubiquitination of RECQL4, which inhibits the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction results in reduced cell viability and cell cycle progression, highlighting TRIM58's role as a tumor suppressor in this context (Sun2023TRIM58).

In gastric cancer, TRIM58 interacts with β-catenin, leading to its ubiquitination and inactivation. This interaction suppresses tumor growth by arresting cell-cycle progression and promoting apoptosis, mediated by the downregulation of β-catenin signaling (Liu2019TRIM58).
