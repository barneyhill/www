# FRG2

## Overview
The FRG2 gene encodes the FSHD region gene 2 protein, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Although the precise function of the FRG2 protein remains unclear, it is known to be transcriptionally upregulated in differentiating myoblasts of FSHD patients, suggesting a potential role in muscle differentiation defects associated with the disease (Rijkers2004FRG2). The gene's expression is influenced by the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4, where a reduction in repeat units is linked to FSHD through chromatin relaxation and deregulation of nearby genes, including FRG2 (Rijkers2004FRG2; Orrell2011Facioscapulohumeral). Despite its upregulation in FSHD myoblasts, FRG2 expression is not detected in muscle biopsies, indicating a complex role that may be limited to specific stages of muscle cell differentiation (Klooster2009Comprehensive). The clinical significance of FRG2 is still under investigation, as overexpression in animal models does not replicate the muscular dystrophy phenotype, and individuals with deletions encompassing FRG2 still exhibit typical FSHD symptoms (Jones2016Transgenic; Klooster2009Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
The FRG2 gene is implicated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Alterations in the expression of FRG2 are associated with the pathogenesis of FSHD. In FSHD patients, FRG2 is transcriptionally upregulated in differentiating myoblasts, but not in healthy controls, suggesting a role in the disease's muscle differentiation defects (Rijkers2004FRG2). The gene's expression is influenced by the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4, where a reduction in repeat units is linked to FSHD. This reduction may lead to chromatin relaxation and deregulation of nearby genes, including FRG2 (Rijkers2004FRG2; Orrell2011Facioscapulohumeral).

Despite its upregulation in FSHD myoblasts, FRG2 expression is not detected in muscle biopsies, indicating that its role may be limited to specific stages of muscle cell differentiation (Klooster2009Comprehensive). The clinical significance of FRG2 remains uncertain, as overexpression in animal models does not result in a muscular dystrophy phenotype, and individuals with deletions encompassing FRG2 still exhibit typical FSHD symptoms (Jones2016Transgenic; Klooster2009Comprehensive).
