# ZNF77

## Overview
ZNF77 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 77, a member of the KRAB-ZFP (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein) family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. ZNF77 plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the bronchial epithelium, thereby contributing to the body's defense against fungal pathogens such as *Aspergillus fumigatus* (Gago2018Lung). The protein is involved in modulating the expression of genes that are essential for epithelial function and immune response, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and development. Additionally, ZNF77 interacts with other proteins, such as TRIM28, to mediate transcriptional repression, which is significant for its role in gene regulation (Groner2010KRAB–Zinc). Mutations in the ZNF77 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including susceptibility to fungal infections and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, highlighting its importance in human health (Hong2022Three).

## Function
ZNF77 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, binding to DNA and regulating the expression of various genes. It is involved in maintaining the integrity of the bronchial epithelium, which is crucial for preventing fungal colonization in the lungs. In healthy individuals, ZNF77 helps control the expression of defensins, elastase, and calmodulin, which are important for fungal clearance by the lung epithelium (Gago2018Lung). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell, playing a role in cell differentiation and development.

ZNF77 is also implicated in modulating the body's response to fungal pathogens by maintaining epithelial integrity and regulating the secretion of proteins that modulate pathogen adhesion to the bronchial epithelium and extracellular matrix (Gago2018Lung). The gene's normal function is to prevent excessive fungal colonization and associated inflammatory responses, which can contribute to chronic inflammation and allergy development (Gago2018Lung). Additionally, ZNF77 may influence the expression of genes involved in other conditions, such as early-onset dyslipidemia and myocardial infarction, through its role as a transcription factor (Hong2022Three).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF77 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably in lung colonization by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). The genetic variant rs35699176 in ZNF77 is associated with a loss of integrity in the bronchial epithelium, which facilitates the adhesion, germination, and growth of A. fumigatus. This makes individuals with the variant more susceptible to fungal colonization, particularly in the early stages of infection. Patients with fungal asthma carrying this variant have higher fungal loads in their respiratory airways, suggesting its potential as a risk marker for fungal colonization and related diseases like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (Gago2018Lung).

In the context of Meckel-Gruber syndrome, a rare lethal ciliopathy, frameshift mutations in ZNF77 have been identified. These mutations may influence the expression of other genes, such as CEP290 and CC2D2A, potentially affecting ciliary function and the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for fetal development. This suggests that ZNF77 mutations could have clinical significance by impacting the expression of genes involved in ciliary function and SHH signaling, contributing to the disease phenotype (Hong2022Three).

## Interactions
ZNF77, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence gene expression and cellular processes. It is part of the KRAB-ZFP family, which interacts with KAP1 (also known as TRIM28) to mediate transcriptional repression through heterochromatin spreading. This interaction involves the recruitment of HP1 and the modification of histones, such as H3K9me3, which are crucial for silencing gene expression. In the context of ZNF77, this interaction leads to increased levels of H3K9me3 and HP1b at its promoters and gene bodies, affecting transcriptional activity (Groner2010KRAB–Zinc).

ZNF77 also interacts with TRIM28 in a manner that is influenced by mutations in TRIM28. An acetylation-mimic mutation (K304Q) in TRIM28 alters its interaction with ZNF77, impacting gene expression in leukemic cells. This suggests that ZNF77's interaction with TRIM28 is significant for its role in gene regulation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

In the context of Meckel-Gruber syndrome, ZNF77 mutations have been linked to alterations in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. This suggests that ZNF77 may influence the expression of genes involved in this pathway, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (Hong2022Three).
