# RAB30

## Overview
RAB30 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB30. This protein is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus and plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, maintaining Golgi structure, and facilitating retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Zulkefli2021A). As a small GTPase, RAB30 functions by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, a process that is critical for its role in membrane trafficking and cellular compartmentalization (Barnekow2009Chapter). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagosome formation during bacterial infection and lipid homeostasis in hepatocytes, particularly during fasting (Oda2016GolgiResident; Smith2024Rab30). RAB30's interactions with other proteins, such as golgins and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB), underscore its importance in maintaining cellular function and responding to physiological changes (Lu2021Golgiassociated; Nakajima2018RAB30). Alterations in RAB30 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and liver pathologies, highlighting its clinical significance (Das2022The; Smith2024Rab30).

## Structure
RAB30 is a small GTPase with a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa, characterized by its ability to exchange GTP and GDP, allowing it to exist in active and inactive states (Zulkefli2021A). The protein includes a generic isoprenylation sequence (CCAAX) at its C-terminus, which facilitates membrane attachment through a geranylgeranyl lipid anchor (Zulkefli2021A). This post-translational modification is crucial for its localization to cellular membranes, particularly the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endosomes (Zulkefli2021A).

The primary structure of RAB30 consists of a sequence of amino acids typical of Rab GTPases, which generally have a core fold comprising six beta-sheets and five alpha-helices (Barnekow2009Chapter). The protein undergoes conformational changes in the switch I and switch II regions upon GTP binding and hydrolysis, which are essential for its activity (Barnekow2009Chapter). These regions, along with the hypervariable carboxyterminal domain, influence the targeting of RAB30 to specific cellular compartments (Barnekow2009Chapter). While the tertiary and quaternary structures of RAB30 are not detailed in the available context, its structural features are consistent with those of other Rab family members, which are involved in intracellular membrane trafficking (Homma2020Rab).

## Function
RAB30 is a small GTPase primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and maintaining Golgi structure and function. In healthy human cells, RAB30 is involved in retrograde trafficking, particularly in the transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Zulkefli2021A). It interacts with proteins such as Arf1 and Arf4, which are essential for endosome-to-Golgi transport, and its depletion leads to the dispersal of early and recycling endosomes and TGN compartments (Zulkefli2021A).

RAB30 is also implicated in the formation of autophagosomes in response to bacterial infection, specifically in the biogenesis of pathogen-containing autophagosomes during Group A Streptococcus infection (Oda2016GolgiResident). It recruits PI4KB to the Golgi apparatus and autophagosome-like vacuoles, facilitating the incorporation of trans-Golgi network vesicles into these structures (Nakajima2018RAB30).

In hepatocytes, RAB30 is involved in lipid and protein trafficking, particularly during fasting. It is induced in the liver and plays a role in lipid homeostasis by facilitating the trafficking and secretion of lipoproteins, which are crucial for lipid metabolism (Smith2024Rab30). RAB30's activity in these processes supports energy metabolism by redistributing lipids from the liver to other tissues (Smith2024Rab30).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or splicing of the RAB30 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In invasive breast carcinoma, changes in RAB30 exon splicing have been observed, suggesting a potential role in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (Das2022The). The expression of RAB30 is also influenced by paclitaxel treatment in breast cancer cell lines, indicating its involvement in cancer cell proliferation and growth (Rzymowska2011RAB).

In liver physiology, RAB30 is upregulated during fasting and plays a role in lipid homeostasis. Its expression is dependent on the transcription factor Pparα, and alterations in RAB30 expression can affect lipid and protein trafficking in hepatocytes. In mouse models, the loss of RAB30 has been shown to reverse serum dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia, suggesting its involvement in lipid-related conditions (Smith2024Rab30). Additionally, RAB30 is among the most dysregulated genes in the early stages of drug-induced liver injury, indicating a possible association with liver pathologies (Smith2024Rab30).

RAB30 expression is also elevated during the early phase of liver regeneration, suggesting a role in liver development and function, although it is not directly linked to specific diseases in this context (Yasue2011Elevation).

## Interactions
RAB30, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking. It interacts with several Golgi proteins, including golgins such as GM130, GMAP210, golgin-97, golgin-245/p230, GCC88, and GCC185, which are important for maintaining Golgi architecture and vesicular trafficking (Lu2021Golgiassociated; Zulkefli2021A). RAB30 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB), a key player in autophagy against Group A Streptococcus (GAS). This interaction is GTP-dependent and essential for the recruitment of PI4KB to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs) (Nakajima2018RAB30).

In the context of hepatic lipid metabolism, RAB30 interacts with proteins involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, such as Abcg5, Slco1a1, Lcat, Aup1, Lipe, and Cyp4a10 (Smith2024Rab30). It also associates with Golgi resident proteins like Golga4 and Gorasp2, which are implicated in lipoprotein metabolism (Smith2024Rab30). These interactions suggest that RAB30 plays a significant role in lipid homeostasis and protein trafficking during fasting (Smith2024Rab30).
