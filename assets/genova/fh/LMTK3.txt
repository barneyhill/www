# LMTK3

## Overview
LMTK3, or lemur tyrosine kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system. The protein product of LMTK3, also referred to as lemur tyrosine kinase 3, is characterized by its kinase domain, which plays a pivotal role in regulating endocytic trafficking and synaptic function. LMTK3 is notably involved in the trafficking of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and the phosphorylation of rab-coupling protein (RCP), influencing receptor dynamics and cellular interactions (Gundry2017Phosphorylation; Inoue2014LMTK3). Beyond its physiological roles, LMTK3 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in various cancers, including breast and thyroid cancer (Lu2017LMTK3; Ditsiou2020The). The kinase's interactions with proteins such as HSP90 and CDK5 further underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways and potential as a therapeutic target (Sarma2018Unveiling; Ditsiou2020The).

## Structure
Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with a well-characterized kinase domain. The primary structure of LMTK3 includes a unique DYG motif within its catalytic domain, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the C-spine, a structural feature that connects the αF helix to the N-terminal lobe (Ditsiou2020The). The kinase domain of LMTK3 was crystallized to a 2.1-Å resolution, revealing that it adopts an inactive conformation with the DYG motif stabilized in a 'DYG-out' conformation (Ditsiou2020The).

The secondary and tertiary structures of LMTK3 include key features typical of protein kinases, such as the K/E/D/D signature motif, which involves residues Lys 193, Glu 210, Asp 295, and Asp 313, playing structural and catalytic roles (Ditsiou2020The). The activation loop of LMTK3 contains three potential tyrosine autophosphorylation sites, similar to those in the insulin receptor (INSR) (Ditsiou2020The).

LMTK3 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its function and interactions. The protein is a client of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is essential for its folding and stability (Ditsiou2020The). The presence of alternative splice variants of LMTK3 may result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its structure and role in cellular pathways.

## Function
LMTK3 (lemur tyrosine kinase 3) is a protein kinase predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in regulating endocytic trafficking and synaptic function. In healthy cells, LMTK3 is involved in the endocytic trafficking of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity. This function is particularly significant in neurons, where LMTK3 is enriched around the Golgi membranes and present in endosomal vesicles, indicating its involvement in membrane protein trafficking at neuronal synapses (Inoue2014LMTK3).

LMTK3 also phosphorylates rab-coupling protein (RCP), which is critical for the trafficking of EphA2, a receptor involved in cell:cell repulsion. This phosphorylation event is necessary for the assembly of a complex involving RCP, Rab14, and EphA2, promoting intracellular accumulation of EphA2 within perinuclear endosomes. This process is essential for cell movement and interaction, highlighting LMTK3's role in modulating cellular behavior through its impact on receptor trafficking (Gundry2017Phosphorylation).

In LMTK3-deficient mice, the absence of this kinase leads to pronounced locomotor hyperactivity and altered dopamine metabolism, suggesting its involvement in regulating locomotor behavior and neurotransmitter systems (Inoue2014LMTK3).

## Clinical Significance
Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is implicated in several cancers, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis and treatment resistance. In breast cancer, LMTK3 regulates estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), protecting it from degradation and contributing to resistance against endocrine and chemotherapy. High LMTK3 expression is associated with aggressive breast cancer forms and poor outcomes in ERα-positive patients (Giamas2011Kinome; Ditsiou2020The). LMTK3 also plays a role in chemotherapy resistance, particularly to doxorubicin, by affecting gene expression pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis (Stebbing2018LMTK3).

In thyroid cancer, LMTK3 expression correlates with disease stage and type, and its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and invasion while promoting apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lu2017LMTK3). In bladder cancer, LMTK3 is overexpressed and linked to tumor progression through the ERK/MAPK pathway, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Jiang2020LMTK3). LMTK3 is also involved in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, where its knockdown decreases cell viability and ERα expression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cai2021Knockdown).

## Interactions
Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and stability. LMTK3 interacts with the HSP90-CDC37 chaperone complex, where it acts as a client protein, relying on this complex for stability. The interaction with CDC37 is crucial, as it facilitates LMTK3's access to the HSP90 chaperone system. The compound C28 has been shown to disrupt this interaction, leading to LMTK3 degradation via the proteasome (Ditsiou2020The).

LMTK3 also phosphorylates various proteins, including HSP27, which is identified as a significant in vivo substrate. This phosphorylation modulates a range of proteins in breast cancer cells, highlighting LMTK3's role in signal transduction pathways (Ditsiou2020The).

In the context of cancer, LMTK3 phosphorylates the rab-coupling protein (RCP), which is essential for the trafficking of EphA2, a receptor tyrosine kinase. This interaction is crucial for Rab14-dependent trafficking, promoting cell-cell repulsion and metastasis (Gundry2017Phosphorylation).

Additionally, LMTK3 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in breast cancer, where CDK5 phosphorylates LMTK3, contributing to its catalytic activation and potentially influencing cancer progression (Sarma2018Unveiling).
