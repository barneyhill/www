# SUGT1

## Overview
SUGT1 is a gene that encodes the SGT1 homolog, MIS12 kinetochore complex assembly cochaperone, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes, particularly in the assembly of the kinetochore complex. This protein functions as a cochaperone, assisting in the folding and stabilization of other proteins, and is integral to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. The SGT1 protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a CS domain that interacts with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, although it does not bind to the Hsp90 MEEVD motif (Willhoft2017The). SGT1's role extends to stabilizing microtubule plus-ends, which is vital for cellular processes such as HIV-1 cytoplasmic trafficking and nuclear import (Allouch2020SUGT1). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in the context of diseases like cancer and HIV-1 infection, making SUGT1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Allouch2020SUGT1; Ogi2015The).

## Structure
The SUGT1 protein, encoded by the human SUGT1 gene, plays a crucial role in kinetochore complex assembly. It contains several domains, including the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions. The TPR domain is characterized by its ability to form a right-handed superhelix, composed of three TPR motifs, each consisting of two antiparallel helices (Willhoft2017The). This domain is critical for the interaction with other proteins, such as Skp1, through a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Willhoft2017The).

The SUGT1 protein also includes a CS domain, which interacts with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, although it does not bind to the Hsp90 MEEVD motif due to the absence of certain conserved residues (Willhoft2017The). The protein's structure allows it to stabilize microtubule plus-ends, which is vital for processes such as HIV-1 cytoplasmic trafficking and nuclear import (Allouch2020SUGT1).

SUGT1 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which affects its stability and function (Li2020Long). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. These structural features enable SUGT1 to perform its role in cellular processes effectively.

## Function
The SUGT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of the MIS12 kinetochore complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. SUGT1 acts as a cochaperone, assisting in the folding and stabilization of proteins, and is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell cycle regulation and maintaining genomic stability (Kitagawa1999SGT1).

In healthy human cells, SUGT1 is crucial for stabilizing microtubule plus-ends, which is important for various cellular processes, including the trafficking of cellular components and the organization of the cytoskeleton (Allouch2020SUGT1). The protein's interaction with microtubules is vital for the proper attachment and movement of cellular structures, ensuring efficient cell division and function (Allouch2020SUGT1).

SUGT1 also plays a role in kinetochore assembly, where it facilitates the proper localization of kinetochore components such as Dsn1 and Hec1, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (Li2020Long). This function is critical for preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to aneuploidy and other cellular dysfunctions (Li2020Long).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SUGT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and HIV-1 infection. In cancer, SUGT1 is overexpressed in various tumor tissues, including colon, breast, and lung tumors, as well as in Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. This overexpression is associated with increased recurrence and poorer prognosis in colorectal cancer and is linked to Akt phosphorylation in gastric tumor cells. The gene's role in stabilizing oncogenic fusion proteins, such as EWS-FLI1 and PAX3-FOXO1, is crucial for the growth of certain cancer cells, suggesting that SUGT1 contributes to cancer development by stabilizing oncoproteins (Ogi2015The).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, SUGT1 expression is higher in infected cells, particularly in macrophages/microglia and activated T cells, which are more susceptible to the virus. SUGT1 stabilizes microtubule plus-ends, facilitating the nuclear import of the virus and promoting HIV-1 replication. Depletion of SUGT1 significantly suppresses HIV-1 replication, indicating its critical role in the early pre-integrative steps of the HIV-1 life cycle (Allouch2020SUGT1). These findings highlight SUGT1 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and HIV-1 infection.

## Interactions
SUGT1, a cochaperone involved in kinetochore assembly, interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, facilitating the assembly and stability of the kinetochore complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Li2020Long). SUGT1 also interacts with Skp1, a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and this interaction is important for the turnover and stability of the Mis12 complex, a key component of the kinetochore (Davies2010Hsp90–Sgt1).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, SUGT1 stabilizes microtubule plus-ends, which is crucial for the retrograde trafficking and replication of the virus. This stabilization is achieved through the modulation of microtubule acetylation and the formation of end-binding protein 1 (EB1) comets (Allouch2020SUGT1). SUGT1's interaction with the long noncoding RNA SAM is also significant, as SAM stabilizes SUGT1, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby facilitating kinetochore assembly and myoblast proliferation (Li2020Long). These interactions highlight SUGT1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, from kinetochore assembly to viral infection pathways.
