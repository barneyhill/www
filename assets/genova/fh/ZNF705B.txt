# ZNF705B

## Overview
ZNF705B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 705B, a member of the KRAB-associated zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structures that facilitate specific DNA binding, and a KRAB domain that functions in transcriptional repression. The zinc finger protein 705B is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing transcriptional activity. The gene is part of a cluster that includes ZNF705A, and it has undergone rapid sequence and expression divergence, suggesting a role in primate-specific regulatory pathways (Nowick2010Rapid). ZNF705B's involvement in various diseases, such as gliomas and lung adenocarcinoma, underscores its potential significance in cancer biology, although its precise clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated (Gu2020Molecular; Alenda2021FFPE).

## Structure
ZNF705B is a member of the KRAB-associated zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are small protein structures that facilitate DNA binding through specific amino acids known as zinc 'fingerprint' amino acids (Yang2017The). The primary structure of ZNF705B includes a series of Kruppel-type zinc finger (ZNF) arrays, which are linked to a KRAB motif, although some duplicated genes in this family may lose the KRAB domain while retaining the ZNF motifs (Nowick2010Rapid).

The secondary structure of ZNF705B is likely stabilized by zinc ion coordination, which is typical for zinc finger proteins, allowing them to maintain a compact, folded conformation suitable for DNA interaction. The tertiary structure involves these zinc finger domains forming a stable configuration that facilitates specific DNA binding (Yang2017The).

ZNF705B is part of a gene cluster that includes ZNF705A, with which it shares high sequence similarity (97.89%) and identical numbers of ZNF motifs, although there is a 33% difference in DNA-binding residues, suggesting potential functional divergence (Nowick2010Rapid). The gene is also noted for its rapid sequence and expression divergence, which may indicate selection for novel functions in primates (Nowick2010Rapid).

## Function
ZNF705B is a member of the KRAB-associated zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) protein family, which functions primarily as transcriptional repressors. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain, which interacts with KAP1 to recruit histone deacetylase and methylation complexes, thereby modifying chromatin structure and repressing gene expression (Nowick2010Rapid). The zinc finger domains of ZNF705B are responsible for specific DNA binding, allowing the protein to regulate target genes' transcriptional activity (Huntley2006A).

ZNF705B, like other KRAB-ZNF proteins, is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences. This binding is facilitated by the zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for recognizing and interacting with DNA (Huntley2006A). The protein's activity is primarily localized to the nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory functions (Nowick2010Rapid).

The evolutionary history of ZNF705B suggests that it has undergone recent duplication events, which may have led to rapid sequence and expression divergence, potentially allowing for the acquisition of novel functions in primate-specific regulatory pathways (Nowick2010Rapid).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF705B, a member of the zinc finger protein family, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and mutations. In gliomas, ZNF705B expression is notably downregulated in CUSA-derived material, particularly in vascularized zones of glioma tumors, although the clinical significance of this downregulation is not fully understood (Alenda2021FFPE). In lung adenocarcinoma, ZNF705B has been identified with a statistically significant mutation occurrence, suggesting a potential role in the disease, though specific clinical implications remain unclear (Gu2020Molecular). Additionally, ZNF705B is downregulated in keratinocytes treated with superoxide dismutase 2, indicating its involvement in pathways related to tissue development and cellular responses, but again, the clinical significance is not detailed (Li2019The). These findings suggest that ZNF705B may play a role in cancer biology, although further research is needed to elucidate its precise clinical impact. The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights the importance of understanding its regulatory functions and potential as a therapeutic target.
