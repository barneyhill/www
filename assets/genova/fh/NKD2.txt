# NKD2

## Overview
NKD2 (Naked cuticle homolog 2) is a gene that encodes a protein known as NKD inhibitor of WNT signaling pathway 2, which functions as a crucial antagonist in the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is integral to various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The NKD2 protein is characterized by its structural features, such as a histidine-rich C-terminus and an EFX domain, which includes a putative EF-hand motif potentially involved in calcium binding. Additionally, NKD2 undergoes myristoylation, a post-translational modification essential for its membrane association and function. The protein primarily operates in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with Dishevelled proteins to inhibit Wnt signaling, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. NKD2's role extends to various cellular pathways, including the trafficking of vesicles in T cells and interactions with proteins like A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 12 (AKAP12). Alterations in NKD2 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its significance in tumor suppression and cellular regulation (Wharton2001Vertebrate; Li2016miR130b; Hu2010Myristoylated).

## Structure
NKD2 is a protein that shares structural similarities with the Drosophila naked cuticle (nkd) protein. It contains a histidine-rich C-terminus and an EFX domain, which includes a putative EF hand, a helix-loop-helix motif potentially involved in calcium binding, although it is unclear if NKD2 binds calcium or adopts a standard EF hand conformation (Wharton2001Vertebrate). The protein also has a myristoylation consensus sequence at its N-terminus, which is a post-translational modification where a myristate group is covalently attached to the glycine at the second position. This modification is crucial for NKD2's membrane association and function, particularly in the trafficking of transforming growth factor α (TGFα) to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (Li2004Myristoylated).

NKD2 contains a region necessary for binding the cytoplasmic tail of TGFα, consisting of residues 300-385, which includes four proline-rich motifs. This region is distinct from the Naked homology regions and has low sequence similarity to NKD1 (Li2004Myristoylated). The protein's structure facilitates its role in antagonizing the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with Dishevelled proteins, a function conserved across species (Wharton2001Vertebrate).

## Function
NKD2 (Naked cuticle homolog 2) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an antagonist in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, NKD2 inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins through its EF-hand-like motif, thereby preventing the activation of downstream signaling components (Li2016miR130b). This inhibition is essential for maintaining normal cell growth and preventing excessive proliferation, as Wnt signaling is involved in various cellular processes, including tissue patterning and organogenesis (Li2016miR130b).

NKD2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates Wnt signaling to ensure proper cellular homeostasis. The protein's functional domains include motifs for myristoylation, Dishevelled binding, and vesicle recognition, suggesting its role as a switch protein in cellular signaling pathways (Dong2015Epigenetic). By regulating Wnt signaling, NKD2 plays a role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is vital for normal tissue development and function (Li2016miR130b). The gene is located on chromosome 5p15.3, a region often affected by loss of heterozygosity in certain cancers, further indicating its importance in genomic integrity (Li2016miR130b).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NKD2 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NKD2 is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor overall survival and correlates with clinicopathologic features such as tumor grade and size. The reduced expression of NKD2 leads to hyperactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, contributing to increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance, particularly to doxorubicin (Wang2018Low).

In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), NKD2 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues and is linked to poor prognosis, including lower overall survival rates. NKD2 influences THCA progression through the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation (Ke2023NKD2; Gao2022NKD2).

In breast cancer, NKD2 is frequently methylated, leading to its epigenetic silencing. This methylation is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. NKD2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway, and its downregulation is linked to increased cell proliferation and metastasis (Wang2021LINC00922; Dong2015Epigenetic).

## Interactions
NKD2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular pathways. It is known to antagonize the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway by interacting with Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) at the plasma membrane. This interaction leads to the mutual destabilization and degradation of both proteins through enhanced polyubiquitylation, a process dependent on NKD2's myristoylation (Hu2010Myristoylated). NKD2 does not interact with other Dishevelled proteins like Dvl-2 or Dvl-3 (Hu2010Myristoylated).

In T cells, NKD2 is involved in the trafficking of ORAI1-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process crucial for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). This interaction is essential for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent cytokine production (Wu2021NKD2). NKD2 localizes in intracellular ORAI1+ vesicles and is necessary for their proper trafficking upon TCR stimulation (Wu2021NKD2).

NKD2 also interacts with A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 12 (AKAP12), which facilitates its phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A (PKA). This phosphorylation is crucial for the stability of NKD2 and the cell-surface delivery of Transforming Growth Factor-alpha (TGFα), impacting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) transactivation (Cao2019Protein).
