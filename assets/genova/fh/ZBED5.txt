# ZBED5

## Overview
ZBED5 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger BED-type containing 5, which is part of the BED-type zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of BED-type zinc finger domains, which are involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The ZBED5 protein plays a role in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and chromatin remodeling. Although the specific functions of ZBED5 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in pathways that influence cell growth and differentiation. The study of ZBED5 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential involvement in disease mechanisms and its broader biological significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
