# SBNO1

## Overview
SBNO1 (strawberry notch homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily functioning as a chromatin remodeler. The SBNO1 protein is a member of the SF2 family, which includes DExD/H box helicases and Swi2/Snf2 remodelers, suggesting its role in ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity, although its transcriptional regulatory functions are independent of this activity (Watanabe2017Notch). The protein is characterized by its nuclear localization signals, coiled-coil regions, and a cysteine cluster, which are essential for its function and localization within the nucleus (Watanabe2017Notch). SBNO1 plays a critical role in the Notch and Hippo signaling pathways, acting as a transcriptional integrator that influences gene expression and cellular differentiation (Watanabe2017Notch). Its interactions with transcriptional complexes such as Yap/Tead4 and Notch/Rbpj underscore its importance in early embryonic development and cellular survival (Watanabe2017Notch). The gene's involvement in various diseases, including schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities, and knee osteoarthritis, highlights its clinical significance (Girard2015Mutation; Bulayeva2015Genomic; Novakov2023Intergenic).

## Structure
The SBNO1 protein is a member of the SF2 family, which includes DExD/H box helicases and Swi2/Snf2 remodelers, indicating its potential role as a chromatin remodeler involved in transcriptional control (Watanabe2017Notch). The protein structure of SBNO1 is highly conserved across species, with significant similarities observed between humans, mice, flies, and nematodes (Watanabe2017Notch). Key structural features of SBNO1 include the DExH box and helicase-c domains located in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively (Watanabe2017Notch). These domains suggest that SBNO1 may function as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, although its role in transcriptional regulation is independent of this activity (Watanabe2017Notch).

The protein also contains nuclear localization signals, coiled-coil regions, and a cysteine cluster, which are important for its function and localization (Watanabe2017Notch). The E437 residue in the DExH box is crucial for its transcriptional control, with mutations such as E437Q resulting in a loss of function (Watanabe2017Notch). SBNO1 interacts with the FACT complex, suggesting a role in facilitating transcriptional elongation (Watanabe2017Notch).

## Function
SBNO1 (strawberry notch homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SBNO1 functions as a transcriptional regulator, potentially acting as a chromatin remodeler due to its structural features as a member of the SF2 family, which includes DExD/H box helicases and Swi2/Snf2 remodelers (Watanabe2017Notch). SBNO1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors and co-regulators, impacting cellular differentiation and development (Watanabe2017Notch).

SBNO1 is particularly important in the context of the Notch and Hippo signaling pathways, where it acts as a signal integrator. It facilitates the synergistic activation of the Cdx2 gene, which is crucial for trophectoderm specification during early embryonic development (Watanabe2017Notch). SBNO1 interacts with Yap/Tead4 and Notch/Rbpj transcriptional complexes, enhancing transcriptional activities essential for the regulation of Cdx2 transcription (Watanabe2017Notch). The protein's ATPase activity, particularly the E437 residue, is critical for its function in these regulatory processes (Watanabe2017Notch). These interactions underscore SBNO1's role as a transcriptional integrator at the intersection of multiple signaling pathways, essential for cellular survival and differentiation (Watanabe2017Notch).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SBNO1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of schizophrenia, SBNO1 has been identified as a gene of interest due to its significant association with rare variants in individuals with the disorder. The presence of private nonsense mutations in SBNO1 suggests a potential role in schizophrenia predisposition, although further research is needed to fully understand its implications (Girard2015Mutation).

SBNO1 is also associated with intellectual disabilities. Studies have identified loss of heterozygosity in the SBNO1 gene among individuals with intellectual disabilities, indicating its potential involvement in the genetic basis of these conditions (Bulayeva2015Genomic).

In knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the SBNO1 gene has been linked to disease susceptibility through genetic interactions with other genes such as NFAT5 and GLT8D1. The SNP rs56116847 in SBNO1 is noted for its contribution to KOA risk, highlighting the gene's role in the pathophysiology of the disease (Novakov2023Intergenic).

SBNO1's involvement in cancer is suggested by its role in the Notch and Hippo signaling pathways, which are critical in cancer development. The gene's interaction with these pathways may have implications for carcinogenesis, although this area requires further exploration (Watanabe2017Notch).

## Interactions
SBNO1, a nuclear protein, is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with various proteins and complexes. It physically interacts with Tead4 and Yap, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) analysis. The interaction between SBNO1 and Tead4 is weakened in the presence of Yap, indicating that Tead4 and Yap primarily form a complex, with only a fraction co-existing with SBNO1 (Watanabe2017Notch). SBNO1 also interacts with Rbpj and NICD, although NICD1 presence attenuates the interaction between SBNO1 and Rbpj (Watanabe2017Notch). 

SBNO1 is associated with the FACT complex, a histone chaperone involved in transcriptional elongation. It co-purifies with Ssrp1 and Spt16, components of the FACT complex, but the presence of Yap weakens the interaction between Tead4 and the FACT complex (Watanabe2017Notch). These interactions suggest that SBNO1 acts as a transcriptional integrator at the intersection of multiple signaling pathways, including Notch and Hippo, and plays a role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with DNA-binding proteins and histone chaperones (Watanabe2017Notch).
