# FOXO3

## Overview
FOXO3 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) protein, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a forkhead winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, which allows it to regulate the expression of genes involved in critical cellular processes such as oxidative stress response, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation (Liu2018Critical; Weinzierl2021Molecular). As a transcription factor, FOXO3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and longevity by modulating pathways that protect against oxidative damage and promote autophagy (Hagenbuchner2013Mitochondria; Marinkovic2007Foxo3). The activity of FOXO3 is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influence its subcellular localization and interaction with other proteins (Tzivion2011FoxO). Clinically, FOXO3 is significant in various diseases, acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers while being implicated in neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, as well as being associated with increased lifespan in certain genetic contexts (Coomans2015FOXO; Calissi2020Therapeutic; Grossi2019Chasing).

## Structure
The FOXO3 protein is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 673 amino acids, with a highly conserved forkhead winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD) centrally located within its sequence (Liu2018Critical; Weinzierl2021Molecular). This DBD is responsible for direct interaction with DNA and mediates interactions with proteins such as Estrogen receptor α (ERα) and p53 (Liu2018Critical). The secondary structure of FOXO3 includes α-helices and β-sheets, with the DNA-binding domain maintaining a stably folded conformation (Weinzierl2021Molecular). The tertiary structure involves a winged-helix fold, typical of the forkhead family of transcription factors (Hagenbuchner2019Modulating).

FOXO3 contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at both the N- and C-terminal ends, which exhibit a variety of secondary structures, including α-helices, π-helices, β-sheets, and turns, frequently interconverting (Weinzierl2021Molecular). These IDRs are characterized by a highly uneven distribution of charged and hydrophobic amino acids, contributing to the protein's disordered nature (Weinzierl2021Molecular). The C-terminal IDR contains the KIX-Binding Region and Transactivation Domain, which are involved in transcriptional activation through interactions with the CBP/p300 coactivator complex (Weinzierl2021Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation play a crucial role in regulating FOXO3's activity, affecting its nuclear localization and DNA binding ability (Tzivion2011FoxO).

## Function
The FOXO3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inducing the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase, and peroxiredoxin III, which help manage oxidative stress and protect cells from damage (Hagenbuchner2013Mitochondria; Marinkovic2007Foxo3). FOXO3 also regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, contributing to cellular homeostasis and longevity (i&gt; FOXO3:&lt; b&gt; &lt; Morris2015&lt).

FOXO3 is activated by stress kinase cascades, including Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1), which lead to its nuclear accumulation and interaction with other transcription factors like p53 (Hagenbuchner2013Mitochondria). It is also regulated by AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which enhances its transcriptional activity and promotes autophagy, a process that removes damaged mitochondria (Hagenbuchner2013Mitochondria).

In the cardiovascular system, FOXO3 protects the heart and blood vessels by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and reducing inflammation, which is crucial in preventing aging-associated diseases (i&gt; FOXO3:&lt; b&gt; &lt; Morris2015&lt). It also plays a role in maintaining adult stem cell homeostasis, particularly in neural, leukemic, and hematopoietic stem cells, by protecting them from oxidative damage and supporting their quiescence and autophagy (i&gt; FOXO3:&lt; b&gt; &lt; Morris2015&lt).

## Clinical Significance
FOXO3 is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In cancer, FOXO3 generally acts as a tumor suppressor, but its role can be context-dependent. Inactivation of FOXO3 through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is common in many cancers, leading to decreased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which contributes to tumor progression (Coomans2015FOXO; Farhan2020The). In breast and ovarian cancers, active FOXO3 is associated with a favorable prognosis, while its inhibition correlates with poor survival (Calissi2020Therapeutic). Conversely, in acute myeloid leukemia and gastric cancer, high FOXO3 expression is linked to tumor progression and lower survival rates (Calissi2020Therapeutic).

FOXO3 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases. It can lead to neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease models but provides protection against α-synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease (Calissi2020Therapeutic). In cardiovascular diseases, FOXO3 protects against vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and inflammation, which are crucial in aging-associated diseases (i&gt; FOXO3:&lt; b&gt; &lt; Morris2015&lt). Additionally, FOXO3 is linked to longevity, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased lifespan and reduced age-related diseases (Calissi2020Therapeutic; Grossi2019Chasing).

## Interactions
FOXO3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates FOXO3 at specific AKT phosphorylation sites, T32 and S253. This dephosphorylation is essential for the dissociation of 14-3-3 proteins, allowing FOXO3 to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (Singh2010Protein). The interaction between FOXO3 and PP2A is mediated by specific regulatory subunits of PP2A, such as B56, which influence substrate selectivity and subcellular targeting (Singh2010Protein).

FOXO3 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which bind to phosphorylated FOXO3, facilitating its cytoplasmic retention and inhibiting its nuclear import. This interaction is regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation, which promotes 14-3-3 binding and FOXO3's cytoplasmic localization (Tzivion2011FoxO).

Additionally, FOXO3's DNA-binding domain (DBD) interacts with specific DNA sequences to regulate gene transcription. Small molecules like S9 can bind to the FOXO3-DBD, modulating its transcriptional activity by interfering with its binding to target promoters (Hagenbuchner2019Modulating). These interactions highlight FOXO3's role in regulating gene expression and cellular responses.
