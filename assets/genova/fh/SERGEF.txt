# SERGEF

## Overview
The SERGEF gene encodes the secretion regulating guanine nucleotide exchange factor, a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which plays a critical role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and secretion processes. By facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on small GTPases, the protein encoded by SERGEF influences various cellular activities, including vesicle transport and signal transduction. The gene's expression and the protein's activity have been linked to several physiological and pathological processes, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms and as a biomarker for certain conditions (Asiedu2018Pathways; Shendre2017Genomewide; Xue2020Aberrantly).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The SERGEF gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of atherosclerosis, SERGEF is one of the aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed (AMDE) genes identified as having a strong discriminative ability for different subtypes of the disease. These genes, including SERGEF, are involved in inflammatory processes and pathways such as MAPK signaling, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for risk stratification in clinical settings (Xue2020Aberrantly).

In HIV-positive women, the SERGEF gene has been associated with lower carotid intima-media thickness (cCIMT), potentially due to immunosuppression from antiretroviral therapy or HIV itself. This suggests that SERGEF may influence atherosclerosis through immune-related mechanisms involving guanosine-triphosphatases and serotonin (Shendre2017Genomewide).

In the study of pulmonary carcinoid tumors, SERGEF was identified among differentially expressed genes with copy number variations, although the specific clinical significance of these alterations in relation to SERGEF was not detailed (Asiedu2018Pathways). Further research is needed to fully understand the role of SERGEF in these and potentially other conditions.
