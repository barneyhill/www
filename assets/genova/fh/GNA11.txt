# GNA11

## Overview
GNA11 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha 11, a member of the Gq family of G proteins. This protein is integral to cellular signal transduction, primarily through its role in activating phospholipase C-beta (PLCβ), which subsequently leads to the production of secondary messengers such as inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These messengers are crucial for various cellular processes, including calcium release and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism (Urtatiz2016Gnaq). GNA11 is predominantly active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate responses to external stimuli (Zou2018GNA11). Mutations in GNA11 have been linked to several clinical conditions, including autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism and uveal melanoma, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Li2014Autosomal; Van2010Mutations).

## Function
GNA11 encodes the G protein subunit alpha 11, which is part of the Gq family of G proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in signal transduction by activating phospholipase C-beta (PLCβ), leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These molecules are key secondary messengers that facilitate the release of calcium from intracellular stores and activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively (Urtatiz2016Gnaq). This signaling cascade influences various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism.

In endothelial cells, GNA11 is involved in mediating responses to growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). It plays a significant role in cell migration, a critical process for vascular development and function, without affecting cell proliferation or monolayer integrity (Zou2018GNA11). GNA11 is active in the cell membrane, where it interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to transmit signals from external stimuli to the cellular interior (Zou2018GNA11). This function is essential for maintaining normal physiological processes and responding to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNA11 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting calcium homeostasis and contributing to various diseases. One notable condition is autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism (ADH), which is linked to a germline mutation in GNA11, specifically the p.R60L substitution. This mutation results in a gain-of-function effect, enhancing downstream signaling pathways that inhibit the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia (Li2014Autosomal). The R60L mutation increases the sensitivity of cells to extracellular calcium, although it results in a milder phenotype compared to other mutations like Q209L (Li2014Autosomal).

GNA11 mutations are also implicated in uveal melanoma, a type of eye cancer. Mutations at codons Q209 and R183 in GNA11 are associated with oncogenic activity, contributing to tumorigenesis by activating the MAPK pathway. These mutations are prevalent in metastatic uveal melanoma and are linked to worse survival outcomes (Van2010Mutations; Shoushtari2014GNAQ). The Q209L mutation, in particular, has been shown to induce rapidly growing tumors and metastases in experimental models (Van2010Mutations).

## Interactions
GNA11, a G protein subunit alpha-11, is involved in various signaling pathways through its interactions with other proteins. It is part of the Gq family and interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate signal transduction. Upon activation by GPCRs, GNA11 can interact with phospholipase C beta (PLCβ), leading to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are secondary messengers in cellular signaling pathways (Hughes2014Using).

In the context of melanopsin signaling in retinal ganglion cells, GNA11 is co-expressed with other G proteins such as GNAQ and GNA14. These proteins play overlapping roles in melanopsin-driven responses, with GNA11 being crucial for signaling. Silencing experiments have shown that GNA11, along with GNAQ, is necessary for proper melanopsin signaling, and GNA14 can compensate when both GNAQ and GNA11 are silenced (Hughes2014Using).

GNA11 mutations are also implicated in uveal melanoma, where they lead to constitutive activation of signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway. These mutations impair GTPase activity, resulting in prolonged activation of downstream signaling (SilvaRodríguez2022GNAQ; Larribère2020Update).
