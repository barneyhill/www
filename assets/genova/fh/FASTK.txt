# FASTK

## Overview
FASTK (Fas activated serine/threonine kinase) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and stability. The protein is a member of the FASTK family, which includes several related proteins (FASTKD1-5) that are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. These proteins play a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA), particularly at non-canonical RNA junctions. FASTK is essential for the stabilization of specific mitochondrial mRNAs, such as MT-ND6, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The protein contains RNA-binding domains, including FAST_1, FAST_2, and the RAP domain, which suggest its involvement in RNA cleavage and processing. FASTK's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins and its role in RNA stability highlight its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and mitochondrial disorders (MagranerPardo2021Systematic; Dawidziak2024Human; Ohkubo2021The).

## Function
FASTK (Fas activated serine/threonine kinase) is a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial RNA processing and stability in human cells. It is part of the FASTK family, which includes FASTKD1-5, and is localized in the mitochondrial matrix where it is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) (Ohkubo2021The). FASTK proteins are essential for the maturation and translation of mitochondrial RNAs, particularly at non-canonical RNA junctions that are not flanked by tRNAs (Ohkubo2021The). These proteins influence the levels of both sense and antisense transcripts, and their absence can lead to significant changes in RNA processing, affecting oxidative phosphorylation (Ohkubo2021The).

FASTK is specifically required for the stabilization of MT-ND6 mRNA, which is crucial for the activity of complex I in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). The protein shares RNA binding domains, including FAST_1, FAST_2, and the RAP domain, which may have endonuclease activity, suggesting a role in RNA cleavage and processing (Ohkubo2021The). The FASTK family proteins are involved in the recruitment of the mitochondrial RNA degradosome, with PNPase as a key enzyme, indicating their role in the degradation of antisense ncRNAs to regulate specific mRNA levels (Ohkubo2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the FASTK gene have been implicated in various cancers. FASTK is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and mycosis fungoides, with its expression linked to chromosomal alterations and microRNA interactions (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). Amplifications of FASTK are common in ovarian cancer, where they occur in over 8% of cases (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). The upregulation of FASTK genes is also observed in esophageal, stomach, liver, and lung cancers, suggesting their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets (MagranerPardo2021Systematic).

FASTK family members, including FASTKD2, are involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and translation. Mutations in FASTKD2 have been linked to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, a condition characterized by developmental delay, hemiplegia, convulsions, and low cytochrome c oxidase activity (Ghezzi2008FASTKD2). These mutations can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, affecting cellular respiration and contributing to the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases (Popow2015FASTKD2). The clinical significance of FASTKD2 mutations is underscored by their association with a rare form of Mendelian mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Popow2015FASTKD2).

## Interactions
FASTK is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mitochondrial RNA processing. It preferentially binds to single-stranded, G-rich RNA and is associated with the formation of G-quadruplex structures, which are stabilized by G-tetrads. These interactions suggest that FASTK may inhibit the degradosome, potentially affecting the stability of G4-containing RNA (Dawidziak2024Human). 

FASTK co-localizes with GRSF1 in mitochondria, although their roles differ; GRSF1 promotes the melting of G4 structures, while FASTK is thought to stabilize them (Dawidziak2024Human). FASTK's RNA-binding interface is located within its central helical domain, and it can form higher-order protein-RNA assemblies, suggesting a phase transition-like behavior (Dawidziak2024Human). 

The protein also interacts with mitochondrial mRNAs, such as ND6 mRNA, and its precursors, cooperating with mitochondrial degradosome proteins like polynucleotide phosphorylase PNPase and helicase Suv3p to generate mature ND6 mRNA by preventing degradation (Dawidziak2024Human). These interactions highlight FASTK's role in regulating mitochondrial RNA stability and processing.
