# WAC

## Overview
The WAC gene encodes the WW domain containing adaptor with coiled-coil (WAC) protein, a multifunctional nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes. The WAC protein is characterized by its WW domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and coiled-coil regions that enable dimerization, playing a crucial role in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation (Rudolph2023StructureFunction; Xu2002WAC). It is phosphorylated at multiple sites, which primes it for interactions with other proteins, such as Polo-like kinase 1, and is involved in histone modification, RNA splicing, and autophagy (Qi2018WAC; Xu2002WAC). The WAC protein is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the brain, highlighting its importance in neurological development and function (Rudolph2023StructureFunction). Mutations in the WAC gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome, underscoring its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Leonardi2020A; DeSanto2015WACloss-of-function).

## Structure
The WAC protein, encoded by the WAC gene, is characterized by a WW domain and coiled-coil regions. The WW domain is known for mediating protein-protein interactions and contains a block of three continuous aromatic amino acids, a feature common in nuclear factors involved in RNA processing (Xu2002WAC). The coiled-coil domains, located at the carboxy-terminus, facilitate dimerization (Rudolph2023StructureFunction). The protein also contains highly disordered regions with conserved polar basic, polar acidic, and serine/threonine residues, suggesting potential functional roles for these motifs (Rudolph2023StructureFunction).

The WAC protein is phosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine residues, particularly within conserved S-S/T-P motifs, which primes it for interactions with other proteins, such as Polo-like kinase 1 (Qi2018WAC). These phosphorylation sites are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic entry. The protein is also involved in RNA splicing, as indicated by its colocalization with the splicing factor SC35 in nuclear speckles (Xu2002WAC).

The WAC protein lacks a classical nuclear localization signal but contains predicted nuclear motifs, including a bipartite NLS in the amino terminus and a C-terminal nuclear export signal, which are essential for its nuclear localization and function (Rudolph2023StructureFunction).

## Function
The WAC gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, WAC is involved in the regulation of histone H2B ubiquitination through its interaction with the RNF20/40 complex, which is crucial for chromatin organization and gene transcription (Leonardi2020A; Alawadhi2021Selflimited). WAC also contributes to cell cycle checkpoint activation in response to genotoxic stress by regulating p53-induced p21 transcription, which helps arrest the cell cycle (Leonardi2020A).

In the cytoplasm, WAC localizes to the Golgi apparatus, where it enhances the deubiquitinating activity of VCIP135, a process essential for Golgi reassembly during mitosis (Leonardi2020A; Totsukawa2011VCIP135). WAC is also implicated in autophagy, where it can either promote autophagosome formation during starvation-induced autophagy or inhibit autophagy through mTORC1 activity (Leonardi2020A).

The protein is expressed in various tissues, with high expression in the brain, particularly in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, indicating its importance in neurological development and function (Rudolph2023StructureFunction). WAC's involvement in these processes underscores its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WAC gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome (DESSH), which is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, and distinct dysmorphic features. These features often include a broad forehead, synophrys, bushy eyebrows, and a bulbous nasal tip (Leonardi2020A; DeSanto2015WACloss-of-function). The syndrome recapitulates the 10p11.23 microdeletion syndrome, suggesting that WAC haploinsufficiency is a key factor in the phenotypic presentation (DeSanto2015WACloss-of-function).

Loss-of-function mutations in WAC, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, are typically de novo and lead to a truncated protein, resulting in the clinical manifestations of the syndrome (Leonardi2020A; DeSanto2015WACloss-of-function). These mutations are rare and have been linked to other conditions like autism spectrum disorder and congenital heart disease (Leonardi2020A). The WAC gene's role in cognitive performance is supported by studies in model organisms, such as Drosophila, where mutations affect mTOR signaling, a pathway implicated in several neurological disorders (Leonardi2020A).

The clinical variability observed in WAC-related disorders is attributed to factors such as allelic heterogeneity and the position of the mutation within the gene, which can influence the severity of the condition (Leonardi2020A; DeSanto2015WACloss-of-function).

## Interactions
The WAC protein, encoded by the WAC gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. WAC directly binds to VCIP135, a deubiquitinase, forming a complex with VCIP135 and p97 in Golgi membranes. This interaction enhances the deubiquitinating activity of VCIP135, which is essential for the p97/p47-mediated Golgi membrane fusion pathway (Totsukawa2011VCIP135). WAC's binding to VCIP135 is crucial for Golgi biogenesis, as demonstrated by the dispersion of the Golgi apparatus upon WAC depletion (Totsukawa2011VCIP135).

In the nucleus, WAC interacts with the splicing factor SC35, indicating its role in pre-mRNA splicing. This interaction is supported by WAC's colocalization with SC35 in nuclear speckles (Xu2002WAC). WAC also interacts with RNA polymerase II, potentially influencing transcriptional processes, and is associated with the E3 ligase activity of RNF20/40, promoting H2B ubiquitination (Totsukawa2011VCIP135).

Additionally, WAC has been identified as interacting with BECN1, a component of the autophagy machinery, suggesting a role in regulating autophagy and proteasomal degradation (Joachim2012Coiling). These interactions highlight WAC's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including membrane fusion, RNA processing, and autophagy.
