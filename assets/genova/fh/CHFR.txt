# CHFR

## Overview
The CHFR gene encodes a protein known as Checkpoint with Forkhead and RING Finger domains, which functions as a mitotic checkpoint regulator and E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. The CHFR protein is characterized by its N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, central RING finger domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region, each contributing to its function in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response (Stavridi2002Crystal; Fukuda2008The; Liu2012CHFR). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHFR facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, such as Aurora A kinase and α-tubulin, which are crucial for proper spindle formation and function (Kang2002The; Privette2008Loss). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy (Privette2008CHFR:; Privette2008Loss). Alterations in CHFR expression or function are associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Toyota2003Epigenetic; Takeshita2008CHFR).

## Structure
The CHFR protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cell cycle regulation. It contains an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a central RING finger domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region. The FHA domain is involved in phospho-dependent protein interactions and is crucial for the mitotic checkpoint function of CHFR (Stavridi2002Crystal; Fukuda2008The). Structurally, the FHA domain exhibits a β-sandwich topology, which is similar to the MH2 domain of the tumor suppressor Smad, but with different loop topologies (Mahajan2008Structure). This domain can form segment-swapped dimers, which may have implications for protein oligomerization (Mahajan2008Structure).

The RING finger domain is associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the polyubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, which is essential for CHFR's role in cell cycle regulation (Kang2002The; Kashima2012CHFR). The cysteine-rich region contains a poly(ADP-ribose)-binding zinc finger (PBZ) motif, which is important for CHFR's recruitment to DNA damage sites and its role in the DNA damage response (Liu2012CHFR).

CHFR undergoes post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which regulate its function. Alternative splicing of CHFR can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its cellular roles (Fukuda2008The).

## Function
The CHFR gene encodes a protein that functions as a mitotic checkpoint regulator and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability during cell division. In healthy human cells, CHFR is involved in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes (Privette2008Loss). CHFR interacts with several proteins, including Aurora A kinase and α-tubulin, to regulate their expression and stability. It ubiquitinates these proteins, targeting them for degradation, which is essential for proper spindle formation and function (Privette2008Loss).

CHFR also interacts with spindle checkpoint proteins such as MAD2 and BUBR1, facilitating their proper localization and function during mitosis. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the MAD2/CDC20 complex, which prevents premature anaphase onset and ensures accurate chromosome segregation (Privette2008Loss). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it regulates the timing of mitotic entry and progression, contributing to its role as a tumor suppressor by maintaining genomic integrity (Privette2008CHFR:; Privette2008Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CHFR gene are associated with various cancers. In colorectal cancer, CHFR is frequently inactivated through epigenetic mechanisms such as CpG methylation, leading to a compromised mitotic checkpoint and increased mitotic index in cells treated with microtubule inhibitors (Toyota2003Epigenetic). In breast cancer, loss of CHFR function results in genomic instability, characterized by aneuploidy and chromosome missegregation, which are linked to cancer development (Privette2008Loss). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly smoking-related squamous cell carcinoma, reduced CHFR expression is associated with poor prognosis and is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Takeshita2008CHFR). The inactivation of CHFR in NSCLC is often due to promoter hypermethylation, which is more prevalent in smokers (Takeshita2008CHFR; Mizuno2002Aberrant).

CHFR also plays a role in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where its expression is significantly lower compared to normal cells, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this disease (Song2015Aberrant). The interaction between CHFR and the mitotic kinase Aurora-A is crucial, as CHFR ubiquitinates Aurora-A, and their altered expression is linked to increased malignancy (Takeshita2008CHFR).

## Interactions
CHFR interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. It binds to USP7 (also known as HAUSP), which stabilizes CHFR by protecting it from autoubiquitination and degradation (Oh2007Deubiquitination). CHFR also interacts with PARP-1, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. This interaction is mediated by the automodification domain of PARP-1 and is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of PARP-1, particularly during mitotic stress (Kashima2012CHFR). 

CHFR's interaction with MAD2, a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, is mediated by its cysteine-rich domain. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of MAD2 and its binding to CDC20, which is necessary for inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (Keller2011CHFR). 

CHFR also binds to ß-tubulin and the Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP), with both proteins co-localizing at the mitotic spindle. This interaction is disrupted by microtubule depolymerization, suggesting CHFR's role as a sensor for microtubule disruption (Burgess2008Chfr).
