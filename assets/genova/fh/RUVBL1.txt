# RUVBL1

## Overview
RUVBL1 is a gene that encodes the RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1, a member of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) superfamily. This protein is involved in a variety of essential cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and DNA repair. RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1 forms a hexameric structure and can assemble into a dodecameric complex with its homolog RUVBL2, enhancing its functional capabilities in cellular contexts (Gorynia2011RuvBL1; Gorynia2011Structural). The protein's ATPase activity is crucial for its role in the INO80 and TIP60 chromatin remodeling complexes, which are vital for maintaining chromatin structure and function (Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2). RUVBL1 is also implicated in mitosis, where it interacts with proteins such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to ensure proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Gentili2015Chromosome). Additionally, RUVBL1 has been associated with various cancers, where its altered expression levels contribute to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1; Durślewicz2024RUVBL1).

## Structure
RUVBL1, a member of the AAA+ superfamily, forms a hexameric structure with a central channel approximately 18-20 Å in diameter (gorynia2008structure; Gorynia2011RuvBL1). Each monomer in the hexamer is complexed with an ADP molecule and consists of three domains: DI, DII, and DIII (gorynia2008structure). DI and DIII are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, featuring conserved motifs such as Walker A, Walker B, sensor 1, and sensor 2, which are crucial for nucleotide-driven conformational changes (Gorynia2011RuvBL1). Domain II is unique among AAA+ proteins and acts as a novel DNA/RNA-binding domain (gorynia2008structure).

The quaternary structure of RUVBL1 involves the formation of a dodecameric assembly when complexed with RuvBL2, creating a double hexameric ring (Gorynia2011Structural). This dodecameric structure is symmetrical, with domain II constituting the interaction site between hexameric rings (Gorynia2011RuvBL1). The complex exhibits increased ATPase activity compared to individual proteins, indicating strong communication between RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 (Gorynia2011Structural). RUVBL1 also interacts with single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, with domain II playing a significant role in nucleic acid binding (Gorynia2011RuvBL1).

## Function
RUVBL1, also known as RuvB-like 1, is a critical component of several multisubunit protein complexes involved in essential cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and DNA repair. It forms hetero-hexameric complexes with RUVBL2, which are crucial for the stability and function of these proteins in various cellular contexts (Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2; Gentili2015Chromosome).

RUVBL1 plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling by being part of the INO80 and TIP60 complexes, where it contributes to nucleosome sliding and histone exchange, processes vital for maintaining chromatin structure and function (Dauden2021RUVBL1–RUVBL2). Its ATPase activity is essential for the expression and function of these complexes, particularly in the context of DNA repair and transcription regulation (Jha2008Human).

During mitosis, RUVBL1 is involved in chromosome alignment and segregation, interacting with proteins such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to ensure proper spindle assembly and genomic stability (Gentili2015Chromosome). It also plays a role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by facilitating the phosphorylation of Upf1, a key step in this pathway (Izumi2010AAA+).

RUVBL1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell cycle progression, genomic stability, and cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells (Izumi2010AAA+; Gentili2015Chromosome).

## Clinical Significance
RUVBL1, a gene encoding the RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, RUVBL1 is frequently overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It interacts with the transmembrane protein ITFG1, facilitating collective invasion, a critical process for metastasis. Silencing RUVBL1 or ITFG1 disrupts this invasion, suggesting that targeting the RUVBL1-ITFG1 complex could be a therapeutic strategy (Fan2017RUVBL1ITFG1).

In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high RUVBL1 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and adverse clinicopathological features, making it an unfavorable prognostic factor. Its expression is linked with HIF1A, and high levels of both genes are associated with the worst survival outcomes (Durślewicz2024RUVBL1).

RUVBL1 is also implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where it is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation by interacting with RUVBL2 and the histone variant H2AZ, contributing to tumorigenesis (Lin2020RUVBL1).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RUVBL1, along with RUVBL2, is essential for DNA replication and cell survival. Inhibition of their ATPase activity can lead to replication catastrophe, suggesting potential therapeutic applications (Yenerall2020RUVBL1RUVBL2).

## Interactions
RUVBL1, also known as RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1, is involved in numerous protein interactions and forms part of several multiprotein complexes. It interacts with its homolog RUVBL2 to form a dodecameric structure, which is crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Gorynia2011RuvBL1; Gorynia2011Structural). RUVBL1 is a component of chromatin remodeling complexes such as INO80, TIP60, and p400, which are involved in transcriptional activation, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Gorynia2011RuvBL1; Gorynia2011Structural).

RUVBL1 interacts with several transcription-associated proteins, including β-catenin and transcription factors like c-Myc, E2F1, and ATF2, playing a role in oncogenic pathways (Gorynia2011RuvBL1). It also interacts with the TATA-binding protein and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex, which are essential for transcribing protein-encoding genes (Gorynia2011RuvBL1).

In the context of mitosis, RUVBL1 interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), where it is phosphorylated, indicating a role in cell division processes (Gentili2015Chromosome). RUVBL1 also associates with nucleic acids, interacting with single-stranded DNA/RNA and double-stranded DNA, suggesting a role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling (Gorynia2011RuvBL1).
