# SEMA7A

## Overview
SEMA7A is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 7A, also known as the John Milton Hagen blood group. Semaphorin 7A is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that plays a crucial role in both the immune and nervous systems. As a member of the semaphorin family, it is characterized by a sema domain, which is integral to its function in cellular signaling. In the immune system, semaphorin 7A acts as a potent activator of monocytes and influences cytokine production, while in the nervous system, it promotes axon growth and guidance, independent of plexin receptors. The protein's interactions with integrins, particularly the β1 subunit, are central to its role in mediating cellular processes such as axon outgrowth and inflammatory responses. Mutations in the SEMA7A gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and reproductive disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Jeroen2003Semaphorin; HOLMES2002Sema7A; Zhao2022SEMA7AR148W).

## Structure
SEMA7A, or semaphorin 7A, is characterized by a sema domain, which is a signature feature of semaphorins. This domain exhibits a β-propeller architecture with a distinctive insertion known as the extrusion. The sema domain is shared by semaphorins, plexins, and certain receptor tyrosine kinases such as MET and RON (Siebold2013Structural). The sema domain of SEMA7A has been structurally characterized, revealing a consistent β-propeller and extrusion core with limited variation in mainchain conformation (Siebold2013Structural).

The protein also includes an immunoglobulin-like domain and is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. SEMA7A is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, which influences its localization and function. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional interactions and roles in processes such as immune responses and axonal guidance.

The complete ectodomains of SEMA7A have been structurally characterized, providing insights into its molecular architecture. The semaphorin-mediated dimerization of plexins is central to the signaling mechanism of this receptor system, although specific details on the quaternary structure of SEMA7A itself are not provided (Siebold2013Structural).

## Function
SEMA7A, or semaphorin 7A, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that plays a significant role in both the immune and nervous systems. In the immune system, SEMA7A is a potent activator of monocytes, stimulating chemotaxis and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 at low concentrations. It also induces the release of superoxide and increases granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production from monocytes, promoting their differentiation into dendritic cells (HOLMES2002Sema7A). SEMA7A interacts with integrins, particularly the β1 subunit, to mediate its effects on immune cells, influencing cytokine production and T cell differentiation (Xie2017Semaphorin; Song2021The).

In the nervous system, SEMA7A enhances axon growth in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, which is crucial for proper axon tract formation during embryonic development. This axon outgrowth is mediated through integrin receptors and the activation of MAPK signaling pathways (Jeroen2003Semaphorin). SEMA7A's role in axon guidance and growth is independent of plexin receptors, suggesting it acts through other mechanisms (Jeroen2003Semaphorin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEMA7A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. The Sema7a R145W mutation, equivalent to the human R148W mutation, is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This mutation increases lipid accumulation in the liver by enhancing PKC-α-stimulated fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and uptake, contributing to NAFLD progression (Zhao2022SEMA7AR148W). The mutation also leads to increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as Srebp1, Chrebp, and Lxr, further promoting NAFLD (Zhao2022SEMA7AR148W).

SEMA7A mutations are also linked to reproductive disorders. Dysregulation of Sema7a/β1-integrin signaling affects the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons, leading to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome, characterized by reduced sexual competence and anosmia (Zhao2019A; Messina2011Dysregulation). A specific intron mutation in SEMA7A has been identified in a patient with Kallmann syndrome, suggesting a genetic basis for the condition (Zhao2019A).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SEMA7A mutations in metabolic and reproductive health, indicating their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SEMA7A, or semaphorin 7A, interacts with integrins, particularly those containing the β1 subunit, to mediate various cellular processes. This interaction is crucial for promoting axon outgrowth and is mediated by the integrin-binding motif RGD present in SEMA7A. The binding of SEMA7A to β1 integrins facilitates axon growth and is sensitive to RGD peptides, which can inhibit this interaction (Jeroen2003Semaphorin). SEMA7A also interacts with integrin β1 to activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK), contributing to inflammatory responses in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (Xie2017Semaphorin).

In addition to integrins, SEMA7A interacts with the nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 via integrin β1, forming a complex that mediates inflammation. This interaction is enhanced by the SEMA7A R145W mutation, which increases the phosphorylation of PKCα and activates downstream signaling pathways, promoting inflammatory responses (Li2023Semaphorin). SEMA7A also plays a role in T cell responses, where it acts as a negative regulator by interacting with the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. This interaction may involve protein-protein interactions on the cell surface, potentially stabilized by a receptor on antigen-presenting cells (Czopik2006Semaphorin).
