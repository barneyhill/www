# PTGFRN

## Overview
PTGFRN, or prostaglandin F2 receptor inhibitor, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the tetraspanin subfamily. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in forming Tetraspanin-Enriched Microdomains (TEMs) that serve as scaffolds for protein interactions and signaling pathways. PTGFRN is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, particularly through its interactions with tetraspanins, integrins, and other proteins. It plays a significant role in physiological processes like adipocyte maturation and muscle regeneration, as well as in pathological conditions such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where it is implicated in tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Marquez2021Identification; Mala2021Prostaglandin; Aguila2019The).

## Function
PTGFRN, or prostaglandin F2 receptor inhibitor, is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular and physiological processes. It is a member of the tetraspanin subfamily and is characterized by four transmembrane domains, which allow it to interact with multiple partners and form complexes known as Tetraspanin-Enriched Microdomains (TEMs). These complexes act as scaffolds for protein interaction and stabilization, facilitating signaling in numerous cellular pathways (Marquez2021Identification).

In healthy human cells, PTGFRN is involved in cell adhesion and migration by interacting with proteins such as tetraspanins (CD9 and CD81), integrins, and Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins. These interactions are crucial for normal development and various physiological processes, including adipocyte maturation and muscle regeneration (Mala2021Prostaglandin). PTGFRN also plays a role in lipid accumulation in preadipocytes and extracellular vesicle bioactivity (Marquez2021Identification).

PTGFRN is active at the plasma membrane, where it regulates the stability of proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as p110β, a subunit of PI3K. This regulation is essential for downstream AKT signaling, which is critical for cell survival and proliferation (Aguila2019The). PTGFRN's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to damage.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTGFRN gene have been implicated in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor. PTGFRN is upregulated in GBM, particularly in the classical and mesenchymal subtypes, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased resistance to therapy (Mala2021Prostaglandin; Aguila2019The). High levels of PTGFRN expression correlate with lower median survival rates in GBM patients, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Mala2022Integrative).

PTGFRN contributes to tumor growth and survival by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its expression is regulated by promoter DNA methylation and miR-137, with hypomethylation and miR-137 downregulation leading to its upregulation in GBM (Mala2021Prostaglandin; Mala2022Integrative). PTGFRN also interacts with proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling, such as tetraspanins and integrins, which facilitate its role in tumor progression (Marquez2021Identification).

In addition to its role in GBM, PTGFRN has been identified as a potential mediator of radiation resistance. Its depletion sensitizes GBM cells to ionizing radiation, suggesting that PTGFRN expression protects these cells from genotoxic stress (Aguila2019The). This makes PTGFRN a potential target for therapeutic intervention in GBM, particularly in enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy (Aguila2019The).

## Interactions
PTGFRN, or prostaglandin F2 receptor inhibitor, is known to participate in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a member of the tetraspanin protein family. It forms complexes within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), interacting with tetraspanins such as CD9, CD81, and CD151. These interactions facilitate signaling by acting as scaffolds for protein interactions, forming a 'tetraspanin web' that enhances binding to other partners (Marquez2021Identification; Stipp2010Lamininbinding).

PTGFRN also interacts with integrins, influencing cellular processes like cell adhesion and migration. It is identified as EWI-F, a partner of CD9 and CD81, suggesting its involvement in tetraspanin-integrin interactions (Stipp2010Lamininbinding). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PTGFRN is associated with the stability of the p110β subunit of PI3K, affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for cell survival and resistance to genotoxic stress (Aguila2019The).

PTGFRN's interactions extend to its role in glioma stem-like cells, where it is regulated by promoter DNA methylation and miR-137, impacting neurosphere formation and the expression of reprogramming factors (Mala2022Integrative). These interactions highlight PTGFRN's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and cancer progression.
