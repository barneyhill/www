# ZCCHC4

## Overview
ZCCHC4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 4 protein, which functions as an RNA methyltransferase. This protein is primarily involved in catalyzing the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a modification crucial for ribosomal function and protein synthesis (Ren2019Structure; Pinto2019The). ZCCHC4 is characterized by its zinc-binding methyltransferase activity, with a structure that includes a methyltransferase domain flanked by zinc finger domains, facilitating its role in RNA binding and modification (Ren2019Structure). The protein is localized to the nucleolus, where it interacts with various proteins involved in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis, highlighting its significance in cellular processes (Pinto2019The). Additionally, ZCCHC4 has been implicated in cancer biology, with alterations in its expression linked to poor prognosis and chemoresistance in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Chen2024The; Zhu2022RNAbinding).

## Structure
The ZCCHC4 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure comprising several distinct domains. It includes a methyltransferase (MTase) domain, which is part of the seven β-strand (7BS) class of methyltransferases, flanked by an N-terminal GRF-type zinc finger domain and a C-terminal CCHC domain (Ren2019Structure; Pinto2019The). The MTase domain contains a highly conserved DPPF motif, typical of MTases that introduce m6A modifications, and adopts an autoinhibitory conformation with a self-occluded catalytic site (Ren2019Structure; Pinto2019The).

The tertiary structure of ZCCHC4 reveals four closely packed domains: the N-terminal GRF zinc finger domain, a C2H2 zinc finger domain, the MTase domain, and the C-terminal CCHC zinc finger domain. These domains form an integrated RNA-binding surface, with the GRF and CCHC domains extending the RNA-binding platform (Ren2019Structure). The protein's structure is stabilized by extensive interdomain van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Ren2019Structure).

ZCCHC4 is a zinc-binding methyltransferase, with its zinc fingers coordinating zinc ions, similar to structures found in proteins like RCHY1 and DHHC20 (Pinto2019The). The protein is localized to the nucleolus and interacts with proteins involved in RNA metabolism (Pinto2019The).

## Function
The ZCCHC4 gene encodes a protein that functions as an RNA methyltransferase, specifically catalyzing the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at position A4220. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis in cells (Ren2019Structure; Pinto2019The). ZCCHC4 is localized to the nucleoli, the site of ribosome assembly, where it interacts with proteins involved in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis (Pinto2019The). The protein's structure includes a methyltransferase domain with a DPPF catalytic motif, flanked by zinc finger domains, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and RNA binding (Ren2019Structure).

The m6A modification by ZCCHC4 plays a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of ribosomes, impacting translation dynamics and gene expression at the translational level (Pinto2019The). In ZCCHC4 knockout cells, the absence of this modification perturbs codon-specific translation dynamics, indicating its importance in mRNA translation (Pinto2019The). The protein's activity is regulated by an autoinhibitory conformation, which is modulated upon RNA substrate binding, ensuring specificity for 28S rRNA (Ren2019Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZCCHC4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. In HCC, ZCCHC4 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. It promotes resistance to DNA-damaging agents by inhibiting apoptosis through its interaction with the long non-coding RNA AL133467.2, which disrupts DNA-damage-induced apoptotic signaling (Zhu2022RNAbinding). Knockout or silencing of ZCCHC4 enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents like oxaliplatin by promoting apoptosis in cancer cells (Zhu2022RNAbinding).

In CRC, ZCCHC4 is upregulated in tumor tissues and correlates with poor prognosis, higher TNM stage, and lower differentiation degree. Its overexpression is linked to increased tumor growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its downregulation has the opposite effects. ZCCHC4 also mediates the epigenetic downregulation of the lncRNA lncGHRLOS, contributing to CRC tumorigenesis (Chen2024The). These findings suggest that ZCCHC4 could serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment, highlighting its clinical significance in tumor progression and chemoresistance.

## Interactions
ZCCHC4 is a zinc-binding methyltransferase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis. It is localized to the nucleoli and colocalizes with the ribosomal protein RPL3, indicating its involvement in ribosomal functions (Pinto2019The). ZCCHC4 interacts with components of the ASC-1 complex, including ASCC1, ASCC2, ASCC3, and TRIP4, as well as the m6A-reader YTHDC2, suggesting its role in RNA processing and modification (Pinto2019The). 

The protein also binds to the long non-coding RNA AL133467.2, which is implicated in promoting chemoresistance in human cancers by influencing the DNA damage response and interacting with the DNA damage marker γH2AX (Zhu2022RNAbinding). This interaction is crucial for ZCCHC4's role in chemoresistance, as it disrupts DNA-damage-induced apoptosis (Zhu2022RNAbinding). 

ZCCHC4's RNA-binding platform is formed by flanking zinc finger domains around its methyltransferase domain, which is essential for its interaction with RNA substrates, including the 28S rRNA, where it catalyzes N6-methyladenosine modification (Ren2019Structure). These interactions highlight ZCCHC4's multifaceted role in RNA metabolism and cellular stress responses.
