# VPS37C

## Overview
VPS37C is a gene that encodes the VPS37C protein, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I). The VPS37C protein is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), a process essential for cellular functions such as receptor downregulation, viral budding, and membrane repair. As a subunit of the ESCRT-I complex, VPS37C interacts with other proteins, including Tsg101 and VPS28, to facilitate its role in endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking. The protein is characterized by a Mod(r) domain at its amino terminus and a proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain, which are important for its structural and functional interactions (Wunderley2013The; Eastman2005Identification). VPS37C's involvement in cellular homeostasis and signaling underscores its significance in both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Eastman2005Identification).

## Structure
The VPS37C protein is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking. It is composed of 355 amino acids and features a Mod(r) domain at its amino terminus, which is predicted to form a largely helical structure (Wunderley2013The; Eastman2005Identification). The protein also has a proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain, a characteristic it shares with its homologues VPS37B and VPS37D (Li2015The; Eastman2005Identification).

VPS37C interacts with Tsg101 and VPS28 to form a ternary complex, with each binding to Tsg101 but not to each other, indicating its role in the quaternary structure of the ESCRT-I complex (Eastman2005Identification). The protein binds to multiple peptide determinants in Tsg101, specifically to fragments containing residues 157-390, 250-390, and 303-390 (Eastman2005Identification). VPS37C lacks the PTAP motif found in VPS37B, which affects its binding capabilities (Eastman2005Identification).

The Mod(r) domain of VPS37C is crucial for its interaction with Tsg101, and this domain is conserved among several eukaryotic proteins (Bache2004The). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its specific role in the ESCRT-I complex and viral budding processes (Eastman2005Identification).

## Function
VPS37C is a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I), which plays a crucial role in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). This process is essential for receptor downregulation, viral budding, and membrane repair. In healthy human cells, VPS37C interacts with Tsg101 and VPS28 to form a ternary complex, which is vital for the function of the ESCRT-I complex (Eastman2005Identification). VPS37C is active in the cytoplasm and endosomal membranes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and signaling (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

The protein is involved in the relocalization of ESCRT-I complexes to the plasma membrane during viral budding, particularly in the context of HIV-1, where it is recruited by the HIV-1 Gag protein (Eastman2005Identification). VPS37C also interacts with other proteins such as Hrs and AIP1/ALIX, although the significance of these interactions in healthy cells remains unclear (Eastman2005Identification). The depletion of VPS37C can lead to destabilization of the ESCRT-I complex, triggering cellular stress responses and affecting processes like cell growth and inflammatory responses (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VPS37C gene, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), decreased expression of VPS37C, along with other VPS37 paralogs, has been observed, suggesting that these alterations might serve as vulnerabilities for therapeutic treatment (Kolmus2020Concurrent). The concurrent depletion of Vps37 proteins, including VPS37C, leads to destabilization of the ESCRT-I complex, which is associated with inflammatory responses and inhibition of cell growth, potentially contributing to oncogenic signaling and cancer progression (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

While VPS37C has not been directly linked to cancer growth, its role in virus release and infectivity has been noted, indicating its involvement in cellular processes beyond tumorigenesis (Kolmus2020Concurrent). The destabilization of ESCRT-I due to VPS37C depletion can result in transcriptional changes and adverse tumor phenotypes, affecting processes related to cell migration, growth, and signaling (Kolmus2020Concurrent). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of VPS37C in cancer and suggest that further research is needed to fully understand its role in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
VPS37C is a component of the ESCRT-I complex and participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It binds to Tsg101, a core component of ESCRT-I, through multiple peptide determinants in the carboxyl-terminal fragments of Tsg101, specifically residues 157-390, 250-390, and 303-390 (Eastman2005Identification). VPS37C forms a ternary complex with Tsg101 and VPS28, although it does not directly bind to VPS28 in the absence of Tsg101 (Eastman2005Identification). 

VPS37C also interacts with Hrs, a class E VPS factor, and colocalizes with vesicles induced by CFP-Hrs, indicating a role in vesicular trafficking (Eastman2005Identification). It has a weak interaction with AIP1/ALIX, although this was not confirmed by coprecipitation assays (Eastman2005Identification). Unlike VPS37A, VPS37C does not readily associate with UBAP1, highlighting its selective incorporation into ESCRT-I complexes (Wunderley2013The). 

These interactions underscore VPS37C's role in the ESCRT-I complex, contributing to processes such as viral budding and the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into multivesicular bodies (Eastman2005Identification).
