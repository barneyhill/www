# IFIH1

## Overview
The IFIH1 gene encodes the protein interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, commonly known as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). MDA5 is a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor and a member of the RIG-I-like receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by detecting viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Upon recognition of dsRNA, MDA5 initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to antiviral defense mechanisms. Structurally, MDA5 comprises several domains, including N-terminal caspase activation recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H-box helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain, which are essential for its function in RNA binding and signaling. Mutations in the IFIH1 gene can lead to dysregulation of immune responses, resulting in various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (Rice2014Gainoffunction; Chistiakov2010Interferon).

## Structure
The IFIH1 gene encodes a protein known as interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, also referred to as MDA5. This protein is a member of the RIG-I-like receptor family and plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by detecting viral RNA. The IFIH1 protein is composed of 1025 amino acids and includes several key domains: two N-terminal caspase activation recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H-box helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Rice2014Gainoffunction; Chistiakov2010Interferon).

The helicase domain is divided into two subdomains, Hel1 and Hel2, with an insertion domain known as Hel2i. This domain is responsible for RNA binding and RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, which is essential for the protein's function in recognizing viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Rice2014Gainoffunction; Batool2021Structural). The CTD is involved in RNA binding and filament formation, which is crucial for the protein's activation and signaling (Batool2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, play a role in the regulation of MDA5 activity. For instance, the CTD is phosphorylated by RIOK3 at serine 828, and upon binding to dsRNA, it undergoes dephosphorylation and ubiquitination (Batool2021Structural). These modifications are important for the protein's function in antiviral signaling pathways.

## Function
The IFIH1 gene encodes the protein melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), which is a crucial component of the innate immune system. MDA5 is a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor that detects viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecular pattern associated with viral infections. Upon recognition of dsRNA, MDA5 activates type I interferon signaling pathways through the adaptor molecule MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein), leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Rice2014Gainoffunction; Chistiakov2010Interferon).

MDA5 consists of several domains, including N-terminal tandem caspase activation recruitment domains (2CARD), a central helicase domain responsible for RNA-binding and RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, and a C-terminal domain that serves as an additional RNA binding domain. These domains facilitate the assembly of a core filament on long viral dsRNA, promoting the oligomerization of 2CARD for signaling to MAVS. This process is regulated by ATP hydrolysis, which helps prevent aberrant activation in response to short cellular dsRNAs (Rice2014Gainoffunction).

In healthy human cells, MDA5 plays a vital role in antiviral defense by mediating the induction of an interferon response, helping to control and eliminate viral infections (Rice2014Gainoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFIH1 gene, which encodes the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), are linked to a variety of diseases due to their impact on immune system regulation. Gain-of-function mutations in IFIH1 are associated with conditions such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and Singleton-Merten syndrome. These mutations lead to an upregulated type I interferon response, contributing to inflammatory diseases affecting the brain and skin, as well as early aortic and valvular calcification, dental anomalies, and osteopenia (Rutsch2015A; Rice2014Gainoffunction).

Monoallelic gain-of-function mutations in IFIH1 can also result in multisystem disorders like Singleton-Merten syndrome and spastic paraparesis, characterized by increased interferon signaling (Ruaud2018Autosomaldominant; Najm2024IFIH1). Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in IFIH1 are linked to immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to viral infections, such as severe respiratory tract infections and severe COVID-19 (Asgari2017Severe; Najm2024IFIH1).

Alterations in IFIH1 expression have been observed in autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, where specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene are associated with disease susceptibility (Liu2008IFIH1). These findings highlight the critical role of IFIH1 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The IFIH1 gene encodes the MDA5 protein, which is involved in recognizing viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiating immune responses. MDA5 interacts with dsRNA through its helicase and C-terminal domains, forming a filamentous assembly that is crucial for its function (Rice2014Gainoffunction; Asgari2017Severe). This interaction is ATP-dependent and leads to the polymerization of IFIH1 molecules, which is essential for signaling (Asgari2017Severe).

MDA5 also interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) in a CARD-dependent manner. This interaction is critical for downstream signaling, leading to the activation of transcription factors such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB, which induce the expression of type I interferons (Jaeger2015The; Chistiakov2010Interferon). The interaction with MAVS is part of a larger signaling cascade that involves other proteins, including TRAF family members, TBK1, and IKK-i, which contribute to the activation of NF-kB and the production of type I interferons (Chistiakov2010Interferon).

Mutations in IFIH1 can enhance the stability of the MDA5 filament by increasing its affinity for dsRNA or between MDA5 molecules, potentially affecting ATP hydrolysis and filament disassembly (Rice2014Gainoffunction). These mutations can lead to increased type I interferon signaling, even in the absence of exogenous ligands (Rice2014Gainoffunction).
