# UMOD

## Overview
The UMOD gene encodes uromodulin, a glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the kidney, specifically in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Uromodulin is the most abundant protein in human urine and plays a crucial role in renal function and host defense. It is involved in maintaining water and electrolyte balance by regulating ion transport processes and forming a gel-like structure that acts as a barrier to water permeability. Additionally, uromodulin serves as a protective agent against urinary tract infections by binding to and preventing the adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria. Structurally, uromodulin is characterized by several domains, including epidermal growth factor-like domains and a zona pellucida module, which contribute to its functional properties. Mutations in the UMOD gene are associated with uromodulin-associated kidney diseases, which are characterized by renal dysfunction and can lead to end-stage renal disease (Rampoldi2011The; Weiss2020Architecture; Scolari2014Uromodulin:).

## Structure
Uromodulin, encoded by the UMOD gene, is a glycoprotein primarily produced in the kidney. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: three epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGF I-III), a cysteine-rich domain (D8C), a fourth EGF domain (EGF IV), and a bipartite zona pellucida module (ZP-N and ZP-C) (Weiss2020Architecture). The protein undergoes extensive glycosylation, with high-mannose type N-glycans identified at Asn275 and Asn513, which are crucial for its antiadhesive activity against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (Weiss2020Architecture).

The tertiary structure of uromodulin features a decoy module that includes a β-hairpin stabilized by a disulfide bond and a globular 'D10C' domain with a novel fold (Stsiapanava2022Structure). This structure is significant for its role in preventing bacterial adhesion by acting as a decoy for bacterial adhesin FimH (Stsiapanava2022Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, uromodulin assembles into homopolymeric filaments with a zigzag shape and a fishbone-like appearance, featuring a central core filament and protruding arms (Weiss2020Architecture). These filaments are secreted in the urine and play a protective role in the urinary tract by binding to bacterial cells, thereby reducing susceptibility to infections (Weiss2020Architecture).

## Function
The UMOD gene encodes uromodulin, a protein primarily expressed in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle in the kidney. Uromodulin plays a significant role in maintaining water and electrolyte balance by regulating ion transport processes. It interacts with the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel and the sodium-potassium-chloride (NKCC2) transporter, which are crucial for NaCl reabsorption in the TAL (Scolari2014Uromodulin:). Uromodulin also forms a gel-like structure that acts as a barrier to water permeability, contributing to the maintenance of the countercurrent gradient necessary for urine concentration (Scolari2014Uromodulin:).

In addition to its role in ion transport, uromodulin is involved in host defense mechanisms. It binds to type 1-fimbriated Escherichia coli, preventing bacterial attachment to urothelial receptors, thereby protecting against urinary tract infections (Rampoldi2011The; Scolari2014Uromodulin:). Uromodulin also inhibits calcium crystal aggregation, reducing the risk of kidney stone formation (Rampoldi2011The; Scolari2014Uromodulin:).

Uromodulin may play a role in innate immunity by interacting with immune system components and potentially acting as a chemoattractant and proinflammatory molecule (Rampoldi2011The). It is suggested to trigger inflammatory responses and activate myeloid dendritic cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Scolari2014Uromodulin:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UMOD gene are linked to several autosomal dominant kidney diseases, collectively known as uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD). These include medullary cystic kidney disease type 2 (MCKD2) and familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN). These conditions are characterized by hyperuricemia, reduced urine-concentrating ability, and chronic renal failure, often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Rampoldi2011The; Bleyer2003Clinical). 

UMOD mutations typically result in the misfolding of the uromodulin protein, causing its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and leading to ER stress and tissue damage. This retention is a hallmark of UAKD, classifying it as an ER storage disease (Rampoldi2011The; Vylet’al2006Alterations). The mutations often involve cysteine residues, crucial for disulfide bond formation, which are essential for the protein's proper conformation and function (Wolf2003Mutations).

Clinical manifestations of these mutations include renal cysts, gout, and progressive renal insufficiency. The genetic heterogeneity of these conditions is notable, with some families exhibiting linkage to the UMOD region without identifiable mutations, suggesting the involvement of other genetic factors (Vylet’al2006Alterations).

## Interactions
Uromodulin (UMOD) interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in kidney function and disease mechanisms. It is known to interact with renal ion channels, such as the ROMK2 channel, enhancing its activity and delivery to the plasma membrane (Rampoldi2011The). Uromodulin also binds to pathogens like type 1-fimbriated Escherichia coli, preventing their attachment to the urothelium, which is mediated by its high-mannose moiety (Rampoldi2011The; Devuyst2017Uromodulin:).

In the context of protein folding and cellular stress responses, mutant uromodulin interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones such as BiP, calnexin, and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI). These interactions are part of the calnexin cycle, which is crucial for proper protein folding and ER-associated degradation (Schaeffer2017Mutant). The retention of mutant uromodulin in the ER leads to the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), particularly the IRE1 branch, as evidenced by increased splicing of XBP1 (Schaeffer2017Mutant).

Uromodulin also has immunomodulatory properties, binding to immunoregulatory proteins like immunoglobulin G (IgG), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and can activate the innate immune system by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Devuyst2017Uromodulin:). These interactions highlight its role in modulating immune responses and protecting against infections and kidney injuries.
