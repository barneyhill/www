# GPR141

## Overview
GPR141 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 141, a member of the extensive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by their seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which enable them to traverse the cell membrane and play a crucial role in signal transduction. GPR141 is involved in various physiological processes, including immune response and cellular communication, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are still under investigation. The receptor's activity is mediated through interactions with G proteins, which facilitate the transmission of signals from the extracellular environment to the intracellular space, influencing cellular responses. GPR141 has been implicated in breast cancer progression, where it interacts with key signaling pathways and proteins, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Thomas2021Estrogen; Parija2023Gproteincoupled).

## Structure
GPR141 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices are a hallmark of the GPCR family, contributing to the receptor's ability to traverse the cell membrane. The protein has an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus, which are typical structural features of GPCRs. 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs, including GPR141. These modifications can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and function. Glycosylation typically occurs on the extracellular domains, while phosphorylation sites are often found on the intracellular regions, affecting signal transduction pathways.

GPR141 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can lead to variations in the receptor's function and localization within the cell. The presence of splice variants suggests a potential for diverse physiological roles and regulatory mechanisms. 

The structural configuration of GPR141, with its transmembrane domains and potential post-translational modifications, underscores its role in cellular signaling processes, typical of the GPCR family. The specific structural details, such as the arrangement of helices and the exact sites of modifications, are crucial for its function as a receptor.

## Clinical Significance
GPR141 has been implicated in breast cancer proliferation and metastasis. Overexpression of GPR141 in breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, is associated with increased activation of the p-mTOR1 pathway and reduced expression of the tumor suppressor p53, promoting tumorigenesis (Parija2023Gproteincoupled). This overexpression also correlates with increased expression of mesenchymal markers and decreased expression of epithelial markers, indicating a role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer metastasis (Parija2023Gproteincoupled). GPR141 influences the expression of oncogenic mediators like Cullin1, which interacts with p-mTOR1 substrates, further contributing to cancer progression (Parija2023Gproteincoupled).

In vivo studies have shown that GPR141 overexpression leads to significant tumor growth and alterations in the tumor microenvironment, such as increased levels of Ki67 and N-cadherin, and decreased E-cadherin expression (Parija2023Gproteincoupled). These findings suggest that GPR141 plays a significant role in breast cancer by modulating key signaling pathways and oncogenic mediators, making it a potential therapeutic target for managing breast cancer progression and metastasis (Parija2023Gproteincoupled). However, the clinical significance of GPR141 mutations and their role in other cancers remains to be fully explored.

## Interactions
GPR141, a G protein-coupled receptor, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence breast cancer progression and metastasis. It interacts with ELMO1 and RhoC in inflammatory breast cancer cells, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests that ELMO1 operates downstream of GPR141, playing a role in cell migration and metastasis (Thomas2021Estrogen).

GPR141 also interacts with the p-mTOR/p53 signaling axis in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of GPR141 leads to increased activation of p-mTOR1 and reduced expression of p53, contributing to tumorigenesis. This interaction is partly mediated through the proteasomal degradation of p53, facilitated by Cullin1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Co-immunoprecipitation data reveal an interaction between p53 and Cullin1, suggesting that GPR141 may enhance p53 degradation via this pathway (Parija2023Gproteincoupled).

Additionally, GPR141 is associated with the regulation of angiogenic mediators such as VEGF, which can influence the tumor microenvironment. This interaction highlights GPR141's role in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation and migration through various signaling pathways (Parija2023Gproteincoupled).
