# ORC5

## Overview
The ORC5 gene encodes the origin recognition complex subunit 5, a crucial component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) involved in the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The ORC5 protein is characterized by its AAA+ domain, which is essential for nucleotide binding and the structural integrity of the ORC complex, playing a pivotal role in the recruitment of other replication factors (Cheng2020Structural; Feng2021The). As a part of the ORC, ORC5 is integral to chromatin decondensation and the establishment of the pre-replication complex, facilitating efficient DNA replication initiation (Giri2015Orc5). The gene is located on chromosome 7q22, a region often implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in genomic stability and cell cycle regulation (Quintana1998ORC5L). ORC5's interactions with other ORC subunits and proteins involved in chromatin modification underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining genome integrity (Giri2015Orc5; Matsuda2007Yeast).

## Structure
The ORC5 protein, a subunit of the human origin recognition complex, is involved in DNA replication initiation. It is a 50-kDa protein composed of 435 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 8.35 (Quintana1998ORC5L). The protein shares 38% identity with Drosophila ORC5 and 24% with S. cerevisiae ORC5, indicating evolutionary conservation (Quintana1998ORC5L). ORC5 contains a functional AAA+ domain, which is crucial for nucleotide binding and is involved in the structural integrity and function of the ORC complex (Cheng2020Structural; Feng2021The).

The ORC5 protein is part of the ORC2-5 and ORC1-5 assemblies, where it contributes to the formation of a tightly autoinhibited conformation, with the winged-helix domain (WHD) of ORC2 blocking the central DNA-binding channel (Cheng2020Structural). The binding of ORC1 can alleviate this autoinhibition, suggesting a dynamic role in the complex's activation (Cheng2020Structural). ORC5 is also involved in the formation of a two-tiered spiral structure in the ORC-Cdc6 complex, where its AAA+ domain participates in ATP binding, essential for the recruitment of Cdc6 and subsequent Mcm2-7 loading (Feng2021The). An alternatively spliced variant, HsORC5T, encodes a protein with a unique C-terminal sequence, indicating potential regulatory roles (Quintana1998ORC5L).

## Function
The ORC5 gene encodes a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. ORC5 plays a critical role in chromatin decondensation, particularly during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This process is facilitated by the interaction between ORC5 and the histone acetyltransferase GCN5, which enhances chromatin accessibility by promoting histone acetylation at replication origins. This chromatin decondensation is crucial for the establishment of the pre-replication complex (preRC) and efficient DNA replication initiation (Giri2015Orc5).

ORC5 is unique among ORC subunits in its ability to induce large-scale chromatin decondensation when tethered to a chromatin locus. This function is independent of its ATP binding ability and does not rely on robust histone H3 acetylation, highlighting its distinct role in chromatin architecture (Giri2015Orc5). ORC5 is also associated with active chromatin regions marked by histone modifications such as H3K27Ac, indicating its involvement in maintaining genomic stability (Giri2015Orc5). The gene is located on chromosome 7q22, a region frequently deleted in certain cancers, underscoring its importance in cellular processes beyond replication (Quintana1998ORC5L).

## Clinical Significance
The ORC5 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. Alterations in ORC5 expression have been associated with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These associations are linked to the gene's location on chromosome band 7q22, a region frequently deleted in these myeloid malignancies. However, mutation analysis of the remaining ORC5 allele in patients with these deletions has not revealed any mutations, suggesting that the gene's role in these conditions may not be due to direct mutations (Nakabayashi2001Mutation; Shen2013The).

In HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ORC5 is significantly upregulated compared to HPV-positive cases and adjacent tissues. This upregulation may contribute to the aggressiveness of HPV-negative HNSCC, and ORC5, along with other genes, has been proposed as a potential biomarker for this cancer subtype (Su2021PSMC2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ORC5 is highly expressed in tumor tissues, and its expression levels are associated with disease prognosis. Low expression of ORC5 correlates with better overall and recurrence-free survival, suggesting its potential role as an oncogene in HCC (Wang2020Novel).

## Interactions
The ORC5 protein, a subunit of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), participates in several interactions crucial for its function in DNA replication and genome stability. ORC5 interacts with other ORC subunits, including ORC2, ORC4, and ORC6, forming a stable complex essential for the initiation of DNA replication (Matsuda2007Yeast). These interactions are critical for the structural integrity and function of the ORC complex, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis (Matsuda2007Yeast).

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, ORC5 is involved in recruiting cohesin to the centromeric region, which is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. This role is independent of heterochromatin assembly, as shown by the orc5-H37 mutant, which exhibits defects in cohesion loading but not in heterochromatin formation (Kato2008Schizosaccharomyces). ORC5 also interacts with proteins such as Eso1, Mis4, and Rad21, indicating a cooperative role in cohesion establishment (Kato2008Schizosaccharomyces).

In addition to its role in DNA replication, ORC5 is involved in chromatin decondensation. It interacts with GCN5, a histone acetyltransferase, to induce large-scale chromatin decondensation, a process that is crucial for the loading of other pre-replication complex components (Giri2015Orc5). These interactions highlight ORC5's multifaceted role in maintaining genome integrity and coordinating cell cycle processes.
