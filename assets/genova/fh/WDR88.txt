# WDR88

## Overview
The WDR88 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 88 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that WD repeat domain 88 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the precise biological functions of the WDR88 gene and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, emerging research indicates its involvement in cancer progression and susceptibility to infections. The protein's potential as a biomarker in oncology and its genetic variants associated with disease risk highlight its significance in medical research (Roy2021Integrative; Jiang2022Genomewide; Jaiswal2017WDR88).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR88 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential mutations. In cancer research, WDR88 is associated with metastasis and stromal signatures, particularly in rare disorders such as male breast and female prostate cancers. It is suggested to play a role in the stromal response to tumor invasion, making it a potential biomarker for cancer progression (Jaiswal2017WDR88). 

In the context of infections, the WDR88 gene has been linked to an increased risk of candidiasis. Genetic variants, such as the T allele of rs10422015, are associated with a higher risk of this infection, particularly in liver and brain cortex tissues (Jiang2022Genomewide). 

Additionally, WDR88 has been identified as a potential biomarker for early prostate cancer development and may be a target in gallbladder cancer (Roy2021Integrative). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which WDR88 contributes to these conditions remain unclear, necessitating further research to fully understand its clinical significance.
