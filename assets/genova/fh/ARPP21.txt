# ARPP21

## Overview
ARPP21 is a gene that encodes the cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 21, a protein primarily involved in post-transcriptional regulation and neuronal development. This protein is categorized as a phosphoprotein due to its regulation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates it on specific seryl residues (Williams1989ARPP21). ARPP21 is predominantly expressed in dopamine-innervated regions of the brain and plays a crucial role in T cell development by enhancing the expression of the recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1) at the post-transcriptional level (Xu2024The). Additionally, it is involved in neuronal development by regulating dendritic branching through interactions with microRNAs and other proteins (Rehfeld2018The). The protein's interactions with components of the eIF4F complex and its RNA-binding capabilities underscore its significance in modulating mRNA stability and translation (Rehfeld2018The). Mutations in the ARPP21 gene have been linked to diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and immune-related conditions, highlighting its clinical importance (DolsIcardo2024Identification).

## Structure
ARPP21 is a cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein primarily found in dopamine-innervated brain regions. The protein exists in two isoforms, ARPP-21A and ARPP-21B, which differ slightly in chromatographic mobility and tryptic peptide maps, suggesting minor structural differences possibly due to posttranslational modifications or genetic polymorphism (Hemmings1989ARPP21a). The primary structure of ARPP-21B consists of 88 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 9581 Da, featuring a single NH2-terminal blocked polypeptide chain and an NH2-terminal acetyl group (Williams1989ARPP21). The protein is highly acidic, with a high content of glutamic acid/glutamine and lacks methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, and tryptophan (Hemmings1989ARPP21a).

ARPP21 is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, specifically on seryl residues, with the phosphorylation site located at serine-55 (Williams1989ARPP21). The protein's hydrodynamic properties suggest an elongated, asymmetric tertiary structure, with a high frictional ratio and anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE, indicating decreased SDS binding and extended conformations (Hemmings1989ARPP21a). The protein is stable to heat, ethanol, and partially to acid treatment, indicating little ordered tertiary structure (Hemmings1989ARPP21a). There is no information available on the quaternary structure of ARPP21.

## Function
The ARPP21 gene encodes a thymocyte-specific RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in T cell development by promoting T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity. ARPP21 enhances the expression of the recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1) at the post-transcriptional level by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Rag1 mRNA. This interaction is essential for efficient TCR rearrangement and the formation of a diverse TCR repertoire, which is critical for the immune system's ability to recognize a wide array of antigens (Xu2024The).

ARPP21 is selectively expressed in early thymocytes and is downregulated in response to TCR and calcium signals through phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. This regulatory mechanism ensures that ARPP21 activity is switched off when not required, allowing TCR-induced progenitor expansion without Rag1 (Xu2024The).

In the nervous system, ARPP21 also plays a significant role in neuronal development by regulating dendritic branching. It functions by antagonizing the activity of miR-128, a microRNA involved in neuronal excitability and dendritic morphology, thereby enhancing the translation of certain mRNAs and promoting dendritic growth (Rehfeld2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARPP21 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and immune-related conditions. A specific mutation, p.Pro529Leu, in the ARPP21 gene has been identified in patients with ALS, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. This mutation is associated with a shorter survival time and may be linked to the ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum, although its role is not yet fully established (DolsIcardo2024Identification). Despite these findings, ARPP21 is not widely recognized as an ALS-causing gene, and its role remains categorized as having 'tenuous evidence' in genetic databases (DolsIcardo2024Identification).

In the context of immune function, ARPP21 is crucial for maintaining T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity by regulating Rag1 mRNA expression. Deficiency in ARPP21 leads to reduced TCR diversity, which can impact immune responses. This deficiency has been shown to result in phenotypes similar to Omenn syndrome, characterized by T cell oligoclonality, although without the reduction in peripheral B cells or signs of autoimmunity (Xu2024The). These findings suggest that alterations in ARPP21 expression or function could have significant implications for immune system development and function (Xu2024The).

## Interactions
ARPP21, also known as cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 21, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. It interacts with components of the eIF4F complex, specifically eIF4A and eIF4G, which are crucial for mRNA translation initiation. These interactions are direct and not RNA-mediated, with a stronger affinity for eIF4A1 compared to eIF4A2 (Rehfeld2018The). ARPP21 also self-interacts and binds to 14-3-3 proteins, suggesting a regulatory role through phosphomotif binding (Rehfeld2018The).

The protein binds RNA through its R3H domain, showing specificity for uridine-rich sequences in the 3' UTRs of target mRNAs. This binding is crucial for its function as a positive regulator of post-transcriptional gene expression (Xu2024The; Rehfeld2018The). ARPP21's interaction with RNA is confirmed through UV-crosslinking experiments, and it has been shown to increase the expression of a GFP reporter when tethered to it, indicating its role as a post-transcriptional activator (Rehfeld2018The).

ARPP21 also interacts with the RNA-binding protein IMP1, although this interaction is reduced by RNase treatment, suggesting RNA-mediated interactions (Rehfeld2018The). These interactions highlight ARPP21's role in modulating mRNA stability and translation, contributing to its regulatory functions in cellular processes.
