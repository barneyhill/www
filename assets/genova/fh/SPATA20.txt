# SPATA20

## Overview
SPATA20 is a gene that encodes the protein spermatogenesis associated 20, which is a thioredoxin-like protein involved in various biological processes, particularly those related to male fertility and cellular stress responses. The protein plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, contributing to acrosome formation, mitochondrial function, and sperm motility. It is also involved in the regulation of DNA hydroxymethylation in sperm, especially under environmental stress conditions, and modulates cellular responses to hypoxia by influencing HIF-1α protein levels. Beyond its reproductive functions, SPATA20 is expressed in adipose tissue, where it participates in preadipocyte proliferation and adipogenesis, indicating its involvement in broader metabolic and differentiation processes. Clinically, SPATA20 is linked to male infertility and acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, where its expression correlates with patient prognosis (Choi2024SPATA20; Omolaoye2022Using; Neville2019Regional).

## Function
SPATA20 (spermatogenesis associated 20) is a gene that encodes a thioredoxin-like protein involved in several critical processes related to male fertility. In healthy human cells, SPATA20 plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. It is involved in acrosome formation, maintaining mitochondrial function, and ensuring proper sperm production and motility (Omolaoye2022Using). SPATA20 is also implicated in the regulation of DNA hydroxymethylation in sperm, particularly in response to environmental stressors like bisphenol A (BPA), suggesting a role in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms (Zheng2017Genomewide).

In addition to its role in spermatogenesis, SPATA20 is involved in cellular responses to hypoxia by regulating the protein levels of HIF-1α, a transcription factor crucial for cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions. Depletion of SPATA20 leads to increased HIF-1α levels, indicating its role in modulating the stability and activity of this transcription factor (Choi2024SPATA20). SPATA20 is also expressed in adipose tissue, where it is involved in preadipocyte proliferation and adipogenesis, suggesting a broader role in cellular differentiation and metabolic processes (Neville2019Regional).

## Clinical Significance
SPATA20 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in spermatogenesis and cancer progression. Alterations in SPATA20 expression are linked to male infertility, particularly in conditions such as non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and obstructive azoospermia (OA). In NOA, SPATA20 is generally downregulated, suggesting its importance in normal spermatogenesis (Omolaoye2022Using). SPATA20 is also associated with sperm morphology defects, including Acephalic Spermatozoa Syndrome (ASS) and globozoospermia, although its role in these conditions is less established compared to other genes (Graziani2024Genetic).

In cancer, SPATA20 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating HIF-1α synthesis. Its deficiency enhances the metastatic and angiogenic potential of cancer cells, particularly in colorectal cancer, where its expression is downregulated in tumor tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates in patients, indicating that SPATA20 plays a protective role against cancer progression (Choi2024SPATA20). These findings suggest that SPATA20 could serve as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions.
