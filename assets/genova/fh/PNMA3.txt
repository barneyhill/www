# PNMA3

## Overview
PNMA3 is a gene that encodes the protein PNMA family member 3, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma antigen family. This protein is characterized by a zinc-finger C2HC domain, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation, distinguishing it from other family members such as Ma1 and Ma2 (Rosenfeld2001Molecular). The PNMA3 gene is intronless, which may affect its expression and regulatory mechanisms (Rosenfeld2001Molecular). The protein is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain, testis, trachea, kidney, and heart, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes (Rosenfeld2001Molecular).

## Structure
The PNMA3 protein, encoded by the PNMA3 gene, is a member of the paraneoplastic Ma antigen family. It has a complete open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 464 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 53.3 kDa (Rosenfeld2001Molecular). The primary structure of PNMA3 includes a zinc-finger C2HC domain near its 3' terminus, which is not present in other family members like Ma1 or Ma2 (Rosenfeld2001Molecular). This zinc-finger motif suggests a potential role in transcriptional regulation (Rosenfeld2001Molecular).

The PNMA3 protein is intronless, indicating a streamlined genomic structure that may influence its expression and regulation (Rosenfeld2001Molecular). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PNMA3 are not provided, the presence of the zinc-finger domain implies a folded structure capable of interacting with nucleic acids or other proteins. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, testis, trachea, kidney, and heart, suggesting diverse functional roles (Rosenfeld2001Molecular). There is no information available on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for PNMA3 in the provided context.
