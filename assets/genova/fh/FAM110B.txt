# FAM110B

## Overview
FAM110B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 110, specifically member B. This protein is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation, playing a critical role in mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation. It is predominantly expressed in the nucleus of healthy human cells and is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Xi2018Integrated). The FAM110B protein localizes to spindle poles and centrosomes during mitosis, influencing cell cycle progression, particularly in the G1 phase (Xi2018Integrated). Aberrant expression of FAM110B has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential as a prognostic marker in oncology (Chi2023FAM; Huang2020The).

## Function
FAM110B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation. In healthy human cells, FAM110B is primarily expressed in the nucleus and plays a critical role in mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Xi2018Integrated). The protein accumulates at the spindle poles and centrosomes during mitosis, influencing cell cycle progression, particularly in the G1 phase (Xi2018Integrated). This localization is crucial for ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division, thereby contributing to normal cellular function and organismal development.

FAM110B's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cell division and function. Aberrant expression of FAM110B can disrupt these processes, potentially leading to genomic instability and contributing to disease states such as cancer (Xi2018Integrated). While the specific molecular mechanisms of FAM110B in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its role in cell cycle regulation underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
FAM110B has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, FAM110B is associated with alternative splicing events that influence metastasis and cancer stage. Its expression is higher in breast cancer cells compared to normal cells, and it is linked to the fatty acid metabolism pathway, which plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. FAM110B serves as a significant prognostic indicator in breast cancer, particularly in cases involving bone metastasis (Huang2020The).

In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), FAM110B is part of a prognostic model that effectively stratifies patients into prognostic subgroups. It is an independent prognostic factor, with higher expression levels associated with poorer disease-specific survival and progression-free intervals (Chi2023FAM).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, FAM110B expression decreases with increasing tumor differentiation grades, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker. However, it is not significantly associated with survival time in these patients (Xi2018Integrated).

FAM110B also plays a role in non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer, where it limits proliferation and invasion by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling and induces apoptosis when knocked down, respectively (Chi2023FAM).

## Interactions
FAM110B is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It has been identified to interact with CSPP (centrosome/spindle pole-associated protein) through yeast two-hybrid assays. During interphase, FAM110B localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, accumulating at the centrosome/microtubule organizing center (MTOC), and during mitosis, it slightly accumulates at the centrosomes and spindle poles (Dacheux2013BRCA1Dependent). This interaction suggests a role in cell cycle regulation, potentially through its association with centrosome-associated proteins.

FAM110B also interacts with the splicing factor CIRBP, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.320 (P < 0.001), indicating a significant interaction. This interaction is part of a network involving genes implicated in the fatty acid metabolism pathway, such as ACAT1, ACAT2, ACAA1, ALOX15B, and DHCR7. These interactions suggest that FAM110B is involved in complex regulatory networks in breast cancer, influencing tumorigenesis, metastasis, and prognosis (Huang2020The). The protein-protein interaction network from the String database further emphasizes the role of FAM110B in the context of fatty acid metabolism and its potential impact on cancer progression (Huang2020The).
