# WASHC4

## Overview
WASHC4 is a gene that encodes the protein WASH complex subunit 4, a critical component of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homology (WASH) complex. This protein is integral to the regulation of actin polymerization and endosomal trafficking, processes essential for cellular homeostasis and function. The WASH complex, through its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex, facilitates actin branching on endosomal surfaces, which is vital for cargo sorting and vesicular scission (Courtland2020Genetic; Derivery2009The). WASHC4's role extends to interactions with various cargo adaptor complexes, influencing the transport of substrates to different cellular destinations (Courtland2020Genetic). Additionally, WASHC4 is implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes, as well as muscle integrity, through its interaction with valosin-containing protein (VCP) (Kustermann2018Loss; Courtland2020Genetic). Mutations in WASHC4 have been associated with intellectual disabilities and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Kustermann2018Loss; Wijers2019The).

## Function
The WASHC4 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homology (WASH) complex, which plays a critical role in endosomal trafficking and cytoskeletal regulation. In healthy human cells, the WASH complex is involved in activating Arp2/3-dependent actin branching at the outer surface of endosomes, which is essential for cargo sorting and vesicular scission (Courtland2020Genetic). This process is crucial for the proper transport of substrates to various cellular locations, including the late endosome for lysosomal degradation, the Golgi network for modification, or the cell surface for recycling (Courtland2020Genetic).

The WASH complex interacts with several cargo adaptor complexes, such as the Retromer, Retriever, and COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complexes, to select specific cargo and facilitate their trafficking (Courtland2020Genetic). In neurons, although less understood, the WASH complex is implicated in maintaining endo-lysosomal integrity and is associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes (Courtland2020Genetic). The WASHC4 protein is active in endosomes, contributing to cellular processes like signal transduction and membrane trafficking, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Alekhina2017Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WASHC4 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A specific variant of WASHC4 is associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability, highlighting its role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Kustermann2018Loss; Wijers2019The). Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in WASHC4 have been linked to Alzheimer's disease in an African American cohort, suggesting a potential involvement in neurodegenerative disorders (Kustermann2018Loss).

In zebrafish models, WASHC4 deficiency leads to significant muscle dysfunction and structural abnormalities, such as disorganized myofibrils and dysmorphic mitochondria, which are indicative of myopathy (Kustermann2018Loss). This deficiency also results in increased autophagic vesicles and ER stress, implicating WASHC4 in autophagy-mediated proteostasis (Kustermann2018Loss). These findings suggest that disruptions in WASHC4 function could contribute to muscle-related diseases and potentially other human diseases involving proteostasis, such as striated muscle diseases (Kustermann2018Loss).

The role of WASHC4 in maintaining muscle integrity and its interaction with the valosin-containing protein (VCP) further underscores its clinical significance in muscle and neurological conditions (Kustermann2018Loss).

## Interactions
WASHC4, also known as WASH complex subunit 4, is a component of the WASH complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and endosomal transport processes. WASHC4 interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP), a key regulator of protein turnover and quality control, and this interaction is crucial for maintaining muscle integrity and function. The colocalization of WASHC4 and VCP has been observed at the endoplasmic reticulum in HEK293T cells, indicating a physical interaction that plays a role in autophagy-mediated proteostasis in striated muscle cells (Kustermann2018Loss).

WASHC4 is part of a larger multiprotein assembly known as the WASH complex, which includes other components such as FAM21, Strumpellin, and CCDC53. This complex is structurally related to the WAVE complex and is involved in regulating actin dynamics through interactions with the Arp2/3 complex. The WASH complex is essential for endosomal morphology and trafficking, and its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex is necessary for actin polymerization at the surface of endosomes (Jia2010WASH; Derivery2009The).
