# FABP5

## Overview
Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) is a gene that encodes a member of the fatty acid-binding protein family, which is involved in the intracellular transport and metabolism of fatty acids. The protein product of FABP5, also known as epidermal-type fatty acid-binding protein, is a small cytoplasmic protein that plays a critical role in lipid transport and cellular signaling. It is characterized by a β-barrel structure that facilitates the binding and release of hydrophobic ligands, such as fatty acids, within its internal cavity (Xu2022The; Hunter2017Molecular). FABP5 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin and nervous system, where it influences processes such as keratinocyte differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Xu2022The). The protein interacts with nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs), modulating transcriptional activities that are crucial for lipid metabolism and cellular differentiation (Xu2022The; Napoli2017Cellular). Dysregulation of FABP5 expression has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (McKillop2019Role; Xu2022The).

## Structure
FABP5, also known as fatty acid binding protein 5, is a small cytoplasmic protein involved in lipid transport. Its primary structure consists of 133 amino acid residues (Hunter2017Molecular). The secondary structure of FABP5 is characterized by ten anti-parallel β-strands forming a β-barrel, which is a common feature among fatty acid-binding proteins. This β-barrel is capped by two α-helices, creating a helix-turn-helix motif that plays a crucial role in ligand binding and release (Xu2022The; Smathers2011The).

The tertiary structure of FABP5 is compact and stable, facilitating the binding of hydrophobic ligands within its internal cavity. A disulfide bridge between cysteines 120 and 127 contributes to the protein's stability (Xu2022The; Smathers2011The). The protein's quaternary structure is typically monomeric, although it can form dimers under certain conditions (Lee2015Structural).

FABP5 contains a unique electrophoretic mobility and is highly polymorphic, with a pI range of 6.2-6.4 (Smathers2011The). It may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Xu2022The). The protein's ability to bind and transport fatty acids is critical for its role in various cellular processes.

## Function
FABP5, also known as fatty acid binding protein 5, plays a crucial role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of fatty acids. It acts as a lipid chaperone, facilitating the transport of fatty acids to specific cellular compartments, which supports various biological processes such as signal transduction, lipid droplet storage, and membrane synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (Xu2022The). FABP5 is involved in lipid-mediated transcriptional regulation in the nucleus, influencing gene expression and cellular processes like cell proliferation and differentiation (Xu2022The).

In healthy cells, FABP5 is essential for maintaining lipid and energy metabolism by regulating fatty acid transport within the cell, contributing to tissue homeostasis (Xu2022The). It is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, where it influences keratinocyte differentiation and sebaceous gland activity (Xu2022The). In the nervous system, FABP5 is crucial for neurite outgrowth and axon development, being up-regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF) and essential for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Xu2022The). FABP5 also plays a role in immune function, influencing T-cell subset differentiation and effector functions (Xu2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FABP5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and metabolic disorders. In cancer, FABP5 is frequently dysregulated and is notably upregulated in prostate cancer, where it is present in over 70% of cases, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (McKillop2019Role). In cervical cancer, FABP5 is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, as it enhances lipolysis and fatty acid synthesis, activating NF-κB signaling, which contributes to metastasis (Zhang2020FABP5). FABP5 also plays a role in breast cancer, where its expression is linked to poor survival in triple-negative breast cancer (McKillop2019Role).

In metabolic disorders, FABP5 is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is upregulated in macrophages and keratinocytes during a high-fat diet, leading to inflammatory skin lesions in obesity models (Xu2022The). FABP5 deficiency can prevent these lesions and improve insulin signaling and glucose uptake in adipocytes (Xu2022The). The protein's role in lipid metabolism and inflammation suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for these conditions (Xu2022The).

## Interactions
FABP5 (fatty acid binding protein 5) is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation. It interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), particularly PPARβ/δ and PPARγ, influencing their transcriptional activities. These interactions are crucial for processes such as lipid metabolism and keratinocyte differentiation (Tan2002Selective; Xu2022The). FABP5 also partners with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and is involved in the transport of retinoic acid (RA) to the nucleus, where it can bind to either PPARβ/δ or RAR, depending on the cellular context (Napoli2017Cellular).

In cancer cells, FABP5 interacts with the proto-oncogene c-Myc, which upregulates FABP5 transcription through hypo-methylation of its promoter (Xu2022The). It also stabilizes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, promoting metastasis (Xu2022The). In lung adenocarcinoma, FABP5 interacts with the gene CCAT1, influencing fatty acid metabolism and the expression of key metabolic enzymes through the PPAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcriptional complex (Chen2021CCAT1FABP5). These interactions highlight FABP5's role in modulating various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
