# SEC11A

## Overview
SEC11A is a gene that encodes the SEC11 homolog A, a subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) in humans. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in the maturation of secretory and membrane proteins by cleaving their signal peptides. The SEC11A protein is characterized by a catalytic triad of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Liaci2020Structure). As part of the SPC, SEC11A is involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and calcium signaling, and has been implicated in several diseases, such as cancer and psychiatric disorders (Zanotti2022The; Hu2022Signal). Its interactions with other SPC components and proteins involved in the ER-associated degradation pathway underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (Zanotti2022The).

## Structure
The SEC11A protein is a subunit of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is crucial for cleaving signal peptides from secretory pre-proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The primary structure of SEC11A includes a catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, specifically Ser56, His96, and Asp122, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Liaci2020Structure). The tertiary structure of SEC11A features a globular luminal body composed of beta sheets, forming part of the SPC's catalytic core (Liaci2020Structure). The luminal portion of SEC11A adopts an SPase I fold, aligning well with the catalytic core domain of E. coli SPase I (Liaci2020Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEC11A is part of the hetero-tetrameric SPC-A complex, which includes SPC12, SPC22/23, and SPC25 (Liaci2020Structure). The transmembrane domains of SEC11A, along with other SPC components, form a lipid-filled transmembrane window that is approximately 15 Å wide (Liaci2020Structure). SEC11A also features a unique 'bowsprit helix' at the membrane-ER lumen interface, which is not present in bacterial homologs (Liaci2020Structure). This helix is part of the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of SEC11A, contributing to its interaction with signal peptides (Liaci2020Structure).

## Function
The SEC11A gene encodes a catalytic subunit of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for cleaving signal peptides from nascent proteins. This cleavage is crucial for the maturation and proper functioning of approximately 5,000 different physiological protein substrates in humans, as well as the maturation of many viral proteins (Liaci2020Structure). The SPC is a multi-subunit complex composed of five membrane proteins, including SEC11A, SEC11C, SPCS1, SPCS2, and SPCS3, with SEC11A forming part of the catalytic core along with SPCS3 (Zanotti2022The).

SEC11A is involved in the SPC's interaction with viral polyproteins, indicating its role beyond just signal sequence removal (Zanotti2022The). The catalytic mechanism of SEC11A involves a serine-histidine-aspartate triad, which is distinct from the serine-lysine dyad found in bacterial type I SPases (Zanotti2022The). SEC11A also plays a role in the cleavage of the Jaw1 C-terminal region, which is crucial for calcium release via IP3 receptors, highlighting its importance in cellular calcium signaling (Kozono2023Cleavage). The SPC, including SEC11A, is also involved in the quality control of membrane proteins, particularly under conditions of ER stress, by degrading misfolded proteins and regulating functional protein levels (Zanotti2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The SEC11A gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), SEC11A is significantly upregulated, correlating with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). High SEC11A expression is an independent predictor of unfavorable survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in HNSCC (Hu2022Signal; Ding2022Comprehensive). 

In psychiatric disorders, SEC11A has been identified as a candidate gene associated with conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted SEC11A's involvement in these disorders, suggesting its role in psychiatric conditions (Gunturkun2022GenomeWide).

SEC11A is also involved in colorectal cancer, where specific mutations like SEC11A-R11L have been shown to induce strong immune responses, indicating potential therapeutic implications for targeting these mutations in cancer immunotherapy (Yu2021Neoantigenreactive).

In tongue squamous cell carcinoma, SEC11A is upregulated and negatively regulated by miR-873-5p, affecting cancer cell behaviors such as proliferation and migration, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Yao2021MiR‐873‐5p).

## Interactions
The human gene SEC11A encodes a subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is involved in cleaving signal sequences from proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SEC11A forms part of the catalytic core of the SPC along with SPCS3, and it interacts with other SPC subunits such as SPCS1 and SPCS2, although these interactions may be more regulatory or structural in nature (Zanotti2022The). SEC11A has been shown to physically interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, a key component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is specific to Hrd1, as another E3 ligase, gp78, does not show significant interaction with SEC11A. The interaction between SEC11A and Hrd1 suggests a cooperative role in the degradation of misfolded membrane proteins, where SEC11A-mediated cleavage is a prerequisite for ERAD-mediated degradation (Zanotti2022The).

SEC11A also interacts with SPCS1, which acts as a recruitment factor for noncanonical substrates, such as iRhom2. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses have demonstrated that SPCS1 can interact with HA-tagged SEC11A, indicating a role in the processing and maturation of membrane proteins (Zanotti2022The).
