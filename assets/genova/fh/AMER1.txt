# AMER1

## Overview
The AMER1 gene encodes the APC membrane recruitment protein 1, a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This protein functions primarily as a scaffold, facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules and playing a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis. AMER1 is characterized by its ability to recruit the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein to the plasma membrane, thereby regulating β-catenin levels and maintaining intercellular junctions (Brauburger2013Adenomatous; Zhang2015Structures). The protein's structure includes domains such as the WW domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and phospholipid binding (Boutet2010The). AMER1's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are essential for its function in the Wnt signaling pathway (Kříž2014βArrestin). Mutations in the AMER1 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis and certain cancers, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Boutet2010The; Heikoop2021The).

## Structure
The AMER1 gene encodes a protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein consists of 1135 amino acids and includes six conserved block sequences and a highly divergent region (Sun2024amer1). It contains specific domains such as the WW domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions, and is involved in phospholipid binding, APC interaction, and β-catenin binding (Boutet2010The). The AMER1 protein interacts with the APC-ARM domain through several binding sites, notably A1, A2, and A4, which are crucial for its function in recruiting APC to the plasma membrane (Zhang2015Structures).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is essential for its role in the Wnt signaling pathway (Kříž2014βArrestin). AMER1 also has multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Tanneberger2011Amer1WTX). The protein's structure allows it to act as a scaffold, facilitating interactions with other proteins and playing a significant role in cellular signaling processes (Kříž2014βArrestin).

## Function
AMER1, also known as APC membrane recruitment protein 1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, AMER1 functions as a tumor suppressor by recruiting the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein to the plasma membrane. This recruitment is vital for the maintenance of intercellular junctions and the regulation of β-catenin levels, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway (Brauburger2013Adenomatous; Zhang2015Structures).

AMER1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, thereby negatively regulating Wnt signal transduction. It also facilitates the phosphorylation of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, contributing to the upstream activation of Wnt signaling (Zhang2015Structures). AMER1 is active primarily in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it interacts with other components of the β-catenin destruction complex, such as Axin and β-TrCP, to maintain low levels of β-catenin in the absence of Wnt signaling (Brauburger2013Adenomatous).

Additionally, AMER1 shuttles to the nucleus to enhance the transcriptional activity of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and positively regulates the CBP/p300-mediated p53 acetylation, further influencing cellular processes (Zhang2015Structures).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMER1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OSCS) and Wilms' tumor. OSCS is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by cranial sclerosis and longitudinal striations in the long bone metaphyses. It can also present with multisystem manifestations, including cardiac, myopathic, and gastrointestinal features. The phenotypic severity of OSCS varies significantly, with males often experiencing more severe symptoms or lethality, while females may exhibit milder forms (Heikoop2021The).

In the context of cancer, AMER1 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Mutations or alterations in AMER1 can lead to the activation of this pathway, contributing to the development of cancers such as Wilms' tumor and gastric cancer. In gastric cancer, AMER1 interacts with KIF23, which can disrupt its normal function and promote oncogenic processes (Boutet2010The; Liu2020KIF23).

AMER1 mutations have also been implicated in craniofacial developmental disorders, such as microtia, due to their role in regulating cranial neural crest cell differentiation and cartilage formation (Sun2024amer1).

## Interactions
AMER1, also known as APC membrane recruitment protein 1, is involved in several critical interactions within the Wnt signaling pathway. It interacts with the LRP6 receptor, facilitating its phosphorylation, which is essential for Wnt signaling activation. AMER1 recruits Axin and GSK3b to the plasma membrane, promoting the formation of a complex with LRP6, which is crucial for LRP6 phosphorylation (Tanneberger2011Amer1WTX). 

AMER1 also interacts with CK1g, a kinase necessary for LRP6 phosphorylation at specific sites, further highlighting its role as a scaffold protein in the Wnt signaling pathway (Tanneberger2011Amer1WTX). The protein binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), which is important for its translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent signaling activities (Tanneberger2011Amer1WTX).

In the context of gastric cancer, AMER1 interacts with KIF23, which affects its distribution and regulatory functions. KIF23 binds to AMER1, interfering with its interaction with APC and altering its localization, which modulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Liu2020KIF23). 

AMER1 has multiple binding sites for the APC protein, including A1, A2, A3, and A4, which are crucial for its interaction with APC's ARM domain. These interactions are important for recruiting APC to the plasma membrane and regulating Wnt signaling (Zhang2015Structures).
