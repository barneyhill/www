# TMEM250

## Overview
TMEM250 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 250, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes and has been implicated in several diseases, including neuroticism, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and lung cancer. Although the precise biological functions of TMEM250 are not fully elucidated, it is known to play a role in cellular signaling pathways and disease prognosis. The gene's expression and interactions have been studied in the context of mitochondrial function and cancer progression, highlighting its potential significance in medical research (Zhu2020The; Wei2023Comprehensive; Xia2023The).

## Structure


## Interactions
TMEM250, also known as transmembrane protein 250, has been studied in various contexts for its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes. In the context of neuroticism, TMEM250 is negatively correlated with mitochondrial gene expression in various brain regions, although no direct protein-protein interactions between TMEM250 and mitochondrial protein-coding genes have been observed in the STRING database (Xia2023The). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TMEM250 has been identified as a significant gene in survival analysis, with its interactions mapped using the STRING network analysis to understand its role in perineural invasion (PNI) (Zhu2020The). 

In lung cancer research, TMEM250 is part of a prognosis signature developed to predict patient outcomes. This signature is based on genes regulated by FADD, including TMEM250, although specific protein interactions involving TMEM250 are not detailed (Wei2023Comprehensive). 

Overall, while TMEM250 is implicated in various biological processes and diseases, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain less clearly defined in the available literature.
