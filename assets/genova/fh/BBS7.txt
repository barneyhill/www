# BBS7

## Overview
BBS7 is a gene that encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 7 protein, a crucial component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in the transport of proteins within primary cilia. The BBS7 protein is characterized by a domain organization that includes an N-terminal β-propeller, coiled-coil, γ-adaptin ear (GAE), platform, and C-terminal α-helical domains, which facilitate its role in ciliary function and intracellular trafficking (Ludlam2019Molecular). The BBSome complex, including BBS7, is essential for the biogenesis of ciliary membranes and the regulation of signaling pathways such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), which are critical for developmental processes (Zhang2012BBS). Mutations in the BBS7 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder characterized by a spectrum of clinical features including retinal degeneration, obesity, and renal abnormalities (Aleman2021BardetBiedl).

## Structure
The BBS7 protein is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for protein transport in primary cilia. Structurally, BBS7 shares similarities with BBS1 and BBS2, particularly in a region that is predicted to form a six-bladed beta-propeller structure, as identified through SMART analyses (Badano2003Identification). The protein's domain organization includes an N-terminal β-propeller, coiled-coil, γ-adaptin ear (GAE), platform, and C-terminal α-helical domains (Ludlam2019Molecular). 

The coiled-coil domain of BBS7 interacts with BBS2, forming a tight dimer essential for the assembly of the BBSome complex. This interaction involves residues 339-363 of BBS7 and is characterized by hydrophobic residues at the interface, suggesting a parallel coiled-coil structure (Ludlam2019Molecular). 

BBS7 exists in two alternatively spliced isoforms, with the short isoform being ubiquitously expressed and the long isoform present in various tissues (Badano2003Identification). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in the BBSome, and mutations in BBS7 can lead to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Badano2003Identification).

## Function
The BBS7 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the BBSome complex, which plays a vital role in ciliary function in human cells. The BBSome is involved in the biogenesis of ciliary membranes and the transport of proteins to the cell membrane, essential for the proper functioning of primary cilia. These cilia are microtubule-based structures that extend from the surface of many cell types and are crucial for various cellular signaling pathways (Zhang2012BBS; Mohebian2022A).

BBS7, along with other BBS proteins, is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the retrograde transport of organelles such as melanosomes. This function is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of cilia, which are important for sensory perception and developmental signaling pathways (Yen2006Bardet–Biedl; Blacque2004Loss). The BBSome complex, including BBS7, modulates the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway by regulating the localization of key signaling molecules like Smoothened (Smo) and Patched 1 (Ptch1) within cilia, which is essential for proper tissue patterning during development (Zhang2012BBS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS7 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a range of clinical features including retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, and cognitive impairment (Aleman2021BardetBiedl; Khan2016Genetics). BBS7 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function. Disruptions in this complex due to BBS7 mutations can lead to the clinical manifestations of BBS (Suspitsin2016BardetBiedl).

The retinal phenotype associated with BBS7 mutations often presents as cone-rod dystrophy, characterized by significant cone dysfunction and central retinal degeneration, which can resemble achromatopsia (Aleman2021BardetBiedl). In some cases, individuals with BBS7 mutations may exhibit minimal visual symptoms despite severe retinal abnormalities, indicating variability in disease expression (Aleman2021BardetBiedl).

BBS7 mutations have been identified in various populations, with different mutations contributing to the syndrome's genetic diversity. For instance, a novel missense variant in BBS7 was identified in a consanguineous Pakistani family, expanding the known mutation spectrum of the gene (Hayat2020A). The clinical presentation of BBS does not significantly depend on the specific gene involved, but genotype-phenotype correlations exist, indicating specific disease presentations in carriers of particular alleles (Suspitsin2016BardetBiedl).

## Interactions
BBS7 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary transport. It forms a tight dimer with BBS2 through an extensive coiled-coil interaction, which is central to their interaction within the BBS2-7-9 subcomplex (Ludlam2019Molecular). BBS9 associates with this dimer through interactions with the α-helical domain of BBS2, linking the dimer to a hexameric subcomplex (Ludlam2019Molecular). Cross-linking mass spectrometry has identified multiple inter-protein cross-links between BBS2 and BBS7, supporting the presence of a parallel coiled-coil structure (Ludlam2019Molecular).

BBS7 also interacts with other proteins outside the BBSome. It is part of a complex with chaperonin-like BBS proteins (BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12) and CCT chaperonin proteins, which assist in the folding and assembly of BBSome subunits (Seo2010BBS6). BBS7 interacts with ALDOB, EEF1A1, and EPAS1, although the interaction with EPAS1 is relatively weak (Oeffner2007Novel). These interactions suggest a role for BBS7 in intracellular trafficking and ciliary function, potentially involving microtubule-related transport processes (Oeffner2007Novel).
