# CDH3

## Overview
The CDH3 gene encodes the protein cadherin 3, also known as P-cadherin, which is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell adhesion. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and architecture of epithelial tissues by mediating cellular adhesion and tissue morphology. P-cadherin is predominantly expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelia, including the placenta, epidermis, breast, and prostate, and is crucial for normal tissue function and development (Faraj2023Alteration; Kumara2017PCadherin). The CDH3 gene's expression and regulation are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including its involvement in certain genetic disorders and its potential role as a prognostic marker in cancer (Ahmed2020Hypotrichosis; Xu2019High).

## Function
The CDH3 gene encodes P-cadherin, a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in epithelial tissues. P-cadherin is involved in maintaining tissue architecture and integrity by mediating cellular adhesion and tissue morphology through interactions with β-catenin (Kumara2017PCadherin). It is primarily expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelia, such as those found in the placenta, epidermis, breast, and prostate (Faraj2023Alteration). 

In healthy human cells, CDH3 is involved in regulating cell growth and migration, promoting homotypic interactions between similar cell types (Sharma2023MicroRNA). The protein comprises extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, which facilitate its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Sharma2023MicroRNA). CDH3 is also expressed in the epithelial layers of distal tubules and collecting ducts in noncancerous renal tissues, indicating its role in maintaining normal cellular function in these areas (Faraj2023Alteration). 

Overall, CDH3's function in healthy cells is essential for maintaining structural integrity and facilitating proper cellular interactions, which are critical for normal tissue function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDH3 gene are linked to several rare autosomal recessive disorders. Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) is characterized by sparse scalp hair from birth and progressive macular degeneration, often leading to blindness between the second and fourth decades of life (Ahmed2020Hypotrichosis; BlancoKelly2017New). The condition is caused by mutations in CDH3, which encodes the protein P-cadherin, crucial for cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues, including the retina and hair follicles (Indelman2002A). 

Another disorder associated with CDH3 mutations is ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome), which includes symptoms such as hypotrichosis, macular dystrophy, and limb defects like ectrodactyly (Ahmed2020Hypotrichosis). 

Alterations in CDH3 expression levels are also implicated in cancer. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), CDH3 is significantly upregulated, and high expression levels are associated with better overall survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Xu2019High). The gene's role in cell-cell adhesion may influence tumor progression and metastasis (Xu2019High).

## Interactions
CDH3, also known as cadherin 3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cell behavior and signaling pathways. In breast cancer cells, CDH3 expression is regulated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) isoforms, particularly the LIP isoform, which directly interacts with specific regions of the CDH3 promoter. This interaction leads to the transcriptional activation of the CDH3 gene, resulting in increased P-cadherin protein levels (Albergaria2013CCAATEnhancer). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have demonstrated that C/EBPβ physically binds to the CDH3 promoter, with binding sites BS1 and BS2 being crucial for activation by C/EBPβ isoforms (Albergaria2013CCAATEnhancer).

In the context of cell migration and contact inhibition of locomotion, CDH3 interacts with the Rac1 pathway. The extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of CDH3 have opposing effects on Rac1 activity, which in turn influences cytoskeletal stability and cell migration directionality (Ichikawa2020Nonjunctional). These interactions highlight CDH3's role in regulating cell motility through its domain-dependent modulation of Rac1 activity (Ichikawa2020Nonjunctional).
