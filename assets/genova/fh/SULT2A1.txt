# SULT2A1

## Overview
SULT2A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 2A member 1, a cytosolic enzyme involved in the sulfation of various endogenous compounds, including hormones and drugs. This enzyme belongs to the sulfotransferase family, which plays a critical role in phase II metabolism by transferring sulfonate groups from the co-factor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to substrates, facilitating their excretion from the body. SULT2A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and adrenal glands, where it is essential for the metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and other hydroxysteroids, contributing to hormone regulation and detoxification processes (Coughtrie2016Function; Ekström2015Genetic). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and is subject to regulation by nuclear receptors, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Mueller2018Human; Seely2005Transcriptional).

## Structure
The SULT2A1 protein is a member of the sulfotransferase enzyme family, characterized by its ability to catalyze the sulfate conjugation of various substrates, including hormones and drugs. The primary structure of SULT2A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a flexible active binding pocket, which includes several loops such as loop5, loop7, loop12, and loop16. These loops contribute to the enzyme's substrate specificity and are crucial for its function (Zhu2019Mechanistic).

The secondary structure of SULT2A1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming an α/β fold with a central four-stranded β-sheet. This structural arrangement is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity (REHSE2002Crystal). The tertiary structure of SULT2A1 results in a globular shape, which is stabilized by the binding of the co-factor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). PAPS binding enhances the structural stability of the enzyme and promotes a more rigid conformation of the active-site cap, particularly loop16 (Zhu2019Mechanistic).

In terms of quaternary structure, SULT2A1 forms dimers, which are crucial for its high-affinity sulfation activity. The dimerization involves specific amino acids and is necessary for the proper orientation of substrates within the active site (Cook200924Hydroxycholesterol). The protein also contains a PAPS binding domain, which is vital for its enzymatic function (Zhu2019Mechanistic). Common post-translational modifications of SULT2A1 include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and stability.

## Function
SULT2A1 is a key enzyme involved in the sulfation of a variety of endogenous substrates, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), bile acids, and other hydroxysteroids. This sulfation process is crucial for the metabolism and clearance of these compounds, aiding in their excretion from the body (Coughtrie2016Function; Ekström2015Genetic). SULT2A1 is highly expressed in the liver and adrenal glands, where it plays a significant role in the sulfonation of DHEA to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), a process that stabilizes DHEA and allows it to circulate longer in the bloodstream (Seely2005Transcriptional; Ekström2015Genetic).

The enzyme operates in the cytosol and is involved in phase II metabolism, where it transfers a sulfonate group from the co-factor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to its substrates (Zhu2019Mechanistic). This activity is essential for maintaining hormone balance and detoxification processes in the body. SULT2A1's function is also regulated by interactions with other proteins, such as PAPS synthase 2 (PAPSS2), which is crucial for efficient DHEA sulfation (Mueller2018Human). The enzyme's activity and expression are subject to regulation by various nuclear receptors, which influence its role in steroid metabolism (Seely2005Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SULT2A1 gene have significant clinical implications. Variations in SULT2A1, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to changes in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels, which can affect conditions like prostate cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Kurogi2021SULT). The SULT2A1 rs2547235 SNP is associated with survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, where the presence of the T allele is linked to a higher mortality risk, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Tang2020Potentially).

Copy number variations (CNVs) in SULT2A1 are also clinically significant. Individuals with more copies of the SULT2A1 gene excrete higher levels of steroid sulfates, which may influence the risk of hormone-related cancers and cardiovascular diseases (Schulze2013SULT2A1). Alterations in SULT2A1 expression during the acute-phase response, mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, can lead to decreased sulfation of DHEA, impacting steroid metabolism and potentially contributing to conditions involving inflammation (Kim2004Suppression). These genetic and expression variations highlight the role of SULT2A1 in disease risk and drug response, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its full clinical impact.

## Interactions
SULT2A1 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in metabolic pathways. It forms a complex with PAPS synthase 2 (PAPSS2), which is crucial for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfation. This interaction is characterized by a small binding interface known as the KTVE motif, which stabilizes SULT2A1 and involves substrate-binding loops that are distant from the PAP cofactor, suggesting an allosteric activation or protein stabilization mechanism (Mueller2018Human). The interaction between PAPSS2 and SULT2A1 is stronger than with its ortholog PAPSS1, driven by electrostatic forces, and involves the APS kinase domain of PAPSS2 (Mueller2018Human).

SULT2A1 also participates in multienzyme complexes involved in steroid metabolism. It interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP17A1 and CYB5A, with the presence of PAPS enhancing the interaction with CYB5A. These interactions suggest a cooperative role in steroid metabolism, where cytosolic SULTs and microsomal CYPs catalyze successive reactions (Tumilovich2024The). Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis confirmed direct interactions between CYP17A1 and SULT2A1, characterized by strong affinity (Tumilovich2024The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which SULT2A1 is involved, impacting its function and stability.
