# KCNA5

## Overview
The KCNA5 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 5 (Kv1.5), a crucial component of the Shaker-related subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and a potassium-selective pore, which are essential for its function as a transmembrane ion channel (Burg2010Tetramerization; Remillard2007Function). Kv1.5 plays a significant role in regulating membrane potential and electrical excitability in various cell types, including pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and cardiac tissues. In the heart, it contributes to the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current (I_Kur), which is vital for atrial repolarization and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm (Olson2006Kv1.5). The channel's function is modulated by interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, which can influence its role in physiological and pathological processes (Burg2010Tetramerization; Remillard2007Function). Mutations and altered expression of KCNA5 are linked to cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension, underscoring its clinical significance (Christophersen2012Genetic; Remillard2007Function).

## Structure
The KCNA5 gene encodes the Kv1.5 protein, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that is part of the Shaker-related subfamily. The primary structure of Kv1.5 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and a K+ selective pore region located between the S5 and S6 segments (Burg2010Tetramerization; Remillard2007Function). The protein also includes cytosolic NH2 and COOH termini, with the NH2-terminal containing a tetramerization domain (T1) crucial for channel assembly and interaction with regulatory β-subunits (Burg2010Tetramerization; Remillard2007Function).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a functional ion-conducting pore. The quaternary structure of Kv1.5 is a tetrameric assembly, where four α-subunits come together to form the functional channel, capable of forming homo- or heterotetramers with other Kv1 family members (Remillard2007Function; Olson2006Kv1.5). The T1 domain is essential for the tetramerization process, facilitating α:α and α:β subunit interactions (Burg2010Tetramerization).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the channel's function and regulation. Splice variants of KCNA5 can result in different isoforms, potentially altering the channel's functional properties (Remillard2007Function).

## Function
The KCNA5 gene encodes the Kv1.5 channel, a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a crucial role in regulating membrane potential and electrical excitability in cells. In healthy human cells, particularly in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), the Kv1.5 channel contributes to membrane hyperpolarization, which inhibits voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) activity, leading to pulmonary vasodilation. This process is essential for maintaining normal pulmonary vascular tone and preventing excessive vasoconstriction (Remillard2007Function). The Kv1.5 channel is also involved in mediating apoptotic volume decrease and facilitating apoptosis, which are important for cell turnover and homeostasis (Remillard2007Function).

In cardiac tissues, the Kv1.5 channel is responsible for the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current (I_Kur), which is crucial for atrial repolarization. This function is vital for maintaining electrical homeostasis in the heart and ensuring proper heart rhythm. Disruption of this channel can lead to atrial fibrillation by causing action potential prolongation and increasing susceptibility to arrhythmias (Olson2006Kv1.5). The Kv1.5 channel is primarily active in the cell membrane, facilitating potassium ion flow to maintain cellular homeostasis and proper physiological function (Remillard2007Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KCNA5 gene, which encodes the Kv1.5 potassium channel, are associated with several cardiovascular conditions. In pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), downregulation of KCNA5 expression and inhibited Kv1.5 channel function are linked to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension. This is due to sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and excessive pulmonary vascular remodeling (Remillard2007Function).

In the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), various mutations in KCNA5 have been identified. Loss-of-function mutations, such as E375X, result in a truncated Kv1.5 protein, leading to reduced potassium currents and increased susceptibility to AF (Olson2006Kv1.5). Other mutations, like the 71-81del, alter tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, contributing to AF pathophysiology (Yang2010Novel). Gain-of-function mutations, such as D322H, increase current density and alter activation parameters, potentially shortening action potential duration and increasing atrial excitability (Christophersen2012Genetic).

These genetic variations in KCNA5 highlight its critical role in maintaining normal cardiac and pulmonary function, with mutations leading to significant clinical implications.

## Interactions
KCNA5, encoding the Kv1.5 potassium channel, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. In human mammary epithelial cells, KCNA5 interacts with caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a protein involved in the formation of caveolae. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies, which show co-localization of KCNA5 and Cav-1 in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The expression of KCNA5 is regulated by Cav-1, as reducing Cav-1 levels leads to decreased KCNA5 expression, suggesting a unidirectional regulatory influence (Liu2016Expression).

In cardiac tissue, KCNA5 interacts with tyrosine kinase isoform v-Src. This interaction involves the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of v-Src binding to the proline-rich motif of KCNA5, which suppresses the I_Kur current, indicating a regulatory role of tyrosine kinase signaling in KCNA5 function (Yang2010Novel).

KCNA5 also interacts with heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) in the context of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Hsc70 overexpression leads to decreased KCNA5 expression, promoting granulosa cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting a negative correlation between Hsc70 and KCNA5 (Deng2022Hsc70).
