# SUN3

## Overview
SUN3 is a gene that encodes the protein Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 3, which is a member of the SUN-domain family of proteins. These proteins are integral components of the nuclear envelope and play a pivotal role in the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex. The SUN3 protein is primarily expressed in the testes and is crucial for spermiogenesis, particularly in sperm head shaping and manchette assembly, which are essential for sperm head elongation (Thoma2022Sun4; Gao2020The). SUN3 is thought to localize in the endoplasmic reticulum and possibly the outer nuclear membrane, where it interacts with KASH-domain proteins to facilitate nuclear-cytoskeletal interactions (Tzur2006SUNdomain). The evolutionary conservation of SUN-domain proteins, including SUN3, highlights their significance in maintaining cellular and nuclear architecture (Fridkin2008SUNdomain).

## Function
SUN3 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization of the nuclear envelope, particularly in the context of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex. This complex is essential for connecting the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton, facilitating the transmission of mechanical forces across the nuclear envelope. SUN3 is predominantly expressed in the testes and is involved in spermiogenesis, where it is critical for sperm head shaping and the proper assembly of the manchette, a microtubular structure necessary for sperm head elongation (Thoma2022Sun4; Gao2020The).

In healthy human cells, SUN3 is thought to localize primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and possibly the outer nuclear membrane, where it may serve as a 'reverse anchor' for KASH-domain proteins localized at the inner nuclear membrane (Tzur2006SUNdomain). Although the specific functions of SUN3 in human cells are not fully detailed, it is speculated to be involved in nuclear-cytoskeletal interactions, potentially contributing to nuclear positioning and structural integrity (Razafsky2009Bringing; Tzur2006SUNdomain). The evolutionary conservation of SUN-domain proteins, including SUN3, underscores their importance in maintaining cellular and nuclear architecture (Fridkin2008SUNdomain).

## Interactions
SUN3 is a protein that participates in the formation of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which is crucial for connecting the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. SUN3 interacts closely with SUN4, another SUN-domain protein, to form heteromeric assemblies. These interactions are essential for their localization and function within the nuclear envelope of spermatids. The presence of SUN3 is necessary for the proper localization of SUN4, and vice versa, indicating a coordinated function between these two proteins (Thoma2022Sun4).

SUN3 also interacts with KASH-domain proteins, such as Nesprin1, which are located on the outer nuclear membrane. This interaction helps stabilize the connection between the nuclear envelope and the cytoskeleton, facilitating nuclear shaping and elongation during spermiogenesis (Thoma2022Sun4). The interaction between SUN3 and KASH-domain proteins is part of a broader mechanism where SUN-domain proteins distribute mechanical force across the nuclear envelope (Tzur2006SUNdomain).

The expression levels of SUN3 are interdependent with SUN4, as the absence of one leads to reduced levels of the other, suggesting a regulatory mechanism to maintain balance and prevent dysfunctional assemblies (Thoma2022Sun4).
