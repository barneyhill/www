# RETREG3

## Overview
RETREG3 is a gene that encodes the protein reticulophagy regulator family member 3, also known as FAM134C. This protein is integral to the process of reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy that targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for degradation. RETREG3 is categorized as a membrane-associated protein, playing a pivotal role in maintaining ER homeostasis by facilitating the removal of damaged or excess ER components. This function is crucial for cellular stress responses and protein quality control, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation or stress, such as the unfolded protein response (JimenezMoreno2023SignalRetaining). Additionally, RETREG3 is implicated in immune responses, with expression noted in the thymus and T-cells, and has been identified as a significant player in the protein-protein interaction networks affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Estrada2020Fractional).

## Function
RETREG3, also known as FAM134C, is a protein involved in the selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a process known as reticulophagy. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining ER homeostasis by facilitating the degradation of excess or damaged ER components. RETREG3 is active in the ER membrane and contributes to cellular stress responses and protein quality control, which are essential for overall cellular health and function (JimenezMoreno2023SignalRetaining).

In healthy human cells, RETREG3 is involved in ER-phagy, a selective form of autophagy responsible for the turnover and remodeling of the ER. This process is vital for maintaining cellular health, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation or stress, such as the unfolded protein response (JimenezMoreno2023SignalRetaining). RETREG3 has low basal degradation levels under normal conditions, indicating its role in maintaining ER integrity without excessive turnover (JimenezMoreno2023SignalRetaining).

RETREG3 is also implicated in the propagation of perturbations within protein-protein interaction networks, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is expressed in the thymus and T-cells, suggesting a role in immune responses and potentially in the observed decrease in T-cells in affected patients (Estrada2020Fractional).

## Interactions
RETREG3, also known as FAM134C, is involved in the selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum, a process known as reticulophagy. While specific physical interactions of RETREG3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, it is mentioned as a protein involved in macro-autophagy, suggesting potential interactions with proteins in autophagy pathways (Wu2024Phosphoproteomicsdirected). RETREG3 is identified as one of the top activators in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network affected by SARS-CoV-2, indicating its role in effectively propagating perturbations to proteins involved in human diseases (Estrada2020Analyzing; Estrada2020Fractional). The protein is part of subdiffusive paths that coincide with the shortest topological paths in the PPI network, suggesting it can be perturbed directly from lung proteins or through indirect diffusive paths (Estrada2020Fractional). However, specific details on the physical interactions of RETREG3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available context.
