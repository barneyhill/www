# SHISAL2A

## Overview
The SHISAL2A gene encodes the protein shisa like 2A, which is a member of the shisa family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role in modulating signaling pathways during embryonic development and cellular differentiation. Shisa like 2A is characterized by its involvement in the regulation of Wnt and FGF signaling pathways, which are crucial for various developmental processes. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, indicating its localization within the cell membrane where it can interact with other signaling molecules. Understanding the function and interactions of shisa like 2A is important for elucidating its role in normal physiology and potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
