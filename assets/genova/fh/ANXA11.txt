# ANXA11

## Overview
ANXA11 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A11, a member of the annexin family known for its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Annexin A11 is involved in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling, apoptosis, and vesicle trafficking, and is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells (Tomas2004Annexin; Wang2014Annexin). The protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal core structure that facilitates lipid binding and a unique N-terminal region that contributes to its functional specificity, including roles in RNA binding and the formation of membraneless organelles (Lillebostad2020Structure; Dudas2024The). ANXA11 is essential for cytokinesis and acts as a molecular tether in neurons, aiding in the transport of RNA granules (Liao2019RNA; Tomas2004Annexin). Mutations in ANXA11 have been linked to diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and sarcoidosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Nahm2020ANXA11; Mirsaeidi2016Annexins).

## Structure
Annexin A11 (ANXA11) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by a conserved C-terminal core structure composed of four domains, each with five α helices. This core structure facilitates the binding of negatively charged lipids in a calcium-dependent manner (Lillebostad2020Structure). ANXA11 is notable for its long N-terminal region, which is predicted to be intrinsically disordered and plays a role in RNA binding and the formation of membraneless organelles (Dudas2024The). The N-terminal domain is specific to ANXA11 and is suggested to be responsible for functional differences among annexins (Lillebostad2020Structure).

The N-terminal region of ANXA11 contains a proline-rich domain that contributes to its phase separation potential, facilitating granule formation (Dudas2024The). The N-terminal domain also includes a helical region around residues 38-59, which is involved in interactions with other proteins (Dudas2024The). ANXA11 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its conformation and dynamics (Lillebostad2020Structure).

ANXA11 exists in different isoforms, which have specific localization and functions in the cytoplasm and nucleus, including roles in cytokinesis and apoptosis (Lillebostad2020Structure). The protein's structure is further stabilized by a segment in the N-terminal end of the core, linking domains I and IV through main-chain hydrogen bonding interactions (Lillebostad2020Structure).

## Function
Annexin A11 (ANXA11) is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in calcium signaling, apoptosis, and vesicle trafficking, and is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells (Tomas2004Annexin; Wang2014Annexin). ANXA11 is essential for the completion of cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, by facilitating midbody formation. Its depletion leads to cytokinesis failure and apoptosis, highlighting its critical role in cell division (Tomas2004Annexin).

ANXA11 also functions as a molecular tether in neurons, facilitating the transport of RNA granules by hitchhiking on lysosomes. This process is crucial for the proper distribution of RNA within cells, particularly in neurons with long axons, and is dependent on calcium and phospholipid interactions (Liao2019RNA). The protein's ability to bind to lysosomes and RNA granules is mediated by its C-terminal annexin repeat domain and N-terminal low complexity region, respectively (Liao2019RNA). These functions of ANXA11 are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the correct localization of cellular components.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANXA11 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and sarcoidosis. In ALS, mutations such as p.G38R, p.D40G, p.H390P, and p.R456H are associated with disrupted calcium homeostasis and stress granule dynamics, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Nahm2020ANXA11). These mutations can lead to altered aggregation properties of the annexin A11 protein, affecting its normal cellular functions and potentially causing neurodegeneration (Nahm2020ANXA11). The p.G38R mutation, in particular, is linked to accelerated protein degradation and is found in both familial and sporadic ALS cases (Teyssou2021Genetic).

In sarcoidosis, the ANXA11 gene is associated with the formation of granulomas due to its role in apoptosis and proliferation. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1049550, results in an amino acid substitution (R230C) that affects apoptosis, potentially leading to increased granuloma formation (Mirsaeidi2016Annexins). The C allele of this SNP is associated with a higher susceptibility to sarcoidosis, while the T allele may offer some protection (Mirsaeidi2016Annexins). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

## Interactions
Annexin A11 (ANXA11) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. ANXA11 interacts with RNA granules and lysosomes, acting as a molecular tether that facilitates the transport of RNA granules by hitchhiking on lysosomes. This interaction is mediated by its N-terminal low complexity region (LCR) and C-terminal annexin repeat domain (ARD), which are essential for binding to RNA granules and lysosomal membranes, respectively (Liao2019RNA).

ANXA11's interaction with lysosomes is calcium-dependent, involving the binding to lysosomal-like membranes and inducing a liquid-to-gel phase transition in the lipids. This process is influenced by the presence of phosphoinositides such as PI(3,5)P2 (Liao2019RNA; NixonAbell2023ANXA11). ANXA11 also interacts with proteins such as ALG2 and CALC, which modulate its ability to engage RNP granules and affect the nanomechanical properties of ANXA11-lipid assemblies (NixonAbell2023ANXA11).

Mutations in ANXA11, particularly those associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired RNA granule transport and potential neuronal dysfunction (Liao2019RNA; Dudas2024The).
