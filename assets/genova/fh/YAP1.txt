# YAP1

## Overview
YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional co-activator protein involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and organ size. The protein encoded by YAP1, known as Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator, is characterized by its ability to interact with various transcription factors, particularly the TEAD family, to modulate gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional co-activator due to its role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of other proteins rather than directly binding to DNA. YAP1 is involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, and mechanosensing, and plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by balancing cell proliferation and quiescence (Szulzewsky2021YAP1; Heng2020An). Dysregulation of YAP1 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2014Downstream; Mokhtari2023The).

## Structure
The YAP1 protein is a transcriptional co-activator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. It has two major isoforms, YAP1 and YAP2, which arise from differential splicing. YAP1 contains one WW domain, while YAP2 contains two WW domains (Sudol2012Structures). The primary structure of YAP1 includes a TEAD factor-binding domain, a WW domain, an SH3-binding motif, and a transcriptional activation domain. The TEAD-binding domain is located between amino acids 47 and 154, and the WW domain spans amino acids 174 to 204 (Sudol2012Structures).

The secondary structure of YAP1 features alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly within the WW domain, which forms an anti-parallel triple-stranded β-sheet (Sudol2012Structures). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional conformation, allowing YAP1 to interact with various partner proteins. The WW domain is stabilized by a hydrophobic core of four amino acids, contributing to its stability without the need for cofactors or disulfide bonds (Sudol2012Structures).

YAP1's quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as TEAD4, which is crucial for its oncogenic activity (Sudol2012Structures). Post-translational modifications, like phosphorylation, regulate YAP1's activity and localization, influencing its role in cellular signaling (Sudol2012Structures).

## Function
The YAP1 gene encodes the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional co-activator involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. YAP1 is a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size. It interacts with the TEAD family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression, influencing cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, and mechanosensing (Heng2020An). YAP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression to promote cell growth and survival (Zhao2007Inactivation).

YAP1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell mechanics by controlling focal adhesion (FA) assembly, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the actin fiber cytoskeleton. It influences the expression of several structural components of the FA complex, such as vinculin, zyxin, talin, and integrins, which are vital for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Nardone2017YAP). YAP1's activity is linked to the RhoA signaling pathway, which affects the phosphorylation of cofilin, a protein that maintains actin cytoskeleton integrity (Nardone2017YAP).

In the context of tissue homeostasis, YAP1 is involved in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and quiescence, ensuring proper tissue function and repair (Szulzewsky2021YAP1). It also plays a role in cell contact inhibition, with its activity modulated by the Hippo pathway, which sequesters YAP in the cytoplasm to inhibit its function (Zhao2007Inactivation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the YAP1 gene are implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), YAP1 is a critical downstream effector of oncogenic KRAS, essential for the progression of early neoplastic lesions to PDAC. Increased YAP1 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes in PDAC patients, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2014Downstream; Rozengurt2018Yesassociated). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), YAP1 overexpression is linked to tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis, with gene amplification and overexpression associated with worse prognosis (Shin2020The).

YAP1 is also involved in hematological malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and natural killer T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), where its expression correlates with disease progression and poor outcomes. Targeting YAP1 with inhibitors like Verteporfin has shown potential in reducing tumor growth in these cancers (Allegra2021New). In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma, increased YAP1 expression enhances hepatocyte proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis (Mokhtari2023The). These findings highlight the significant role of YAP1 in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
YAP1, a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, interacts with various proteins that influence its function and localization. It directly binds to PTPN14, which is crucial for the density-dependent control of YAP1. This interaction involves the second linker domain of PTPN14, containing two PY motifs, and the two WW domains of YAP1. PTPN14 can translocate YAP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, inhibiting its transcriptional functions, a process independent of PTPN14's phosphatase activity (Wang2012PTPN14).

YAP1 also interacts with NF1, which stabilizes YAP1 by preventing its ubiquitination, thereby maintaining its protein levels. This interaction is mediated through the PPQY motif of NF1 and the WW domains of YAP1, and is significant in the context of gallbladder cancer (Zhang2023The).

Additionally, YAP1 is associated with angiomotin-like proteins (AMOTL1 and AMOTL2), which regulate its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus independently of phosphorylation. This interaction suggests a mechanism for YAP1 regulation that affects its role in tumorigenesis (Wang2011Angiomotinlike).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving YAP1, influencing its role in cell proliferation and organ size control.
