# MPV17

## Overview
The MPV17 gene encodes the mitochondrial inner membrane protein MPV17, which is integral to mitochondrial function and stability. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in forming channels within the mitochondrial inner membrane. MPV17 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability by regulating deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools, essential for mtDNA replication and maintenance. It also plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetic capacity, which are vital for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production. Mutations in the MPV17 gene are linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes, such as the hepatocerebral form and Navajo neurohepatopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial-related disorders (Dalla2016MPV17; ElHattab2018MPV17related; Jacinto2021MPV17).

## Structure
The MPV17 protein is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein encoded by the MPV17 gene, located on chromosome 2p23-21. It consists of 176 amino acids and is characterized by four transmembrane hydrophobic regions, which are predicted to form passages through the lipid membrane (ElHattab2018MPV17related). These transmembrane domains are located at amino acids 18-38, 53-73, 94-114, and 131-151, with both the C- and N-termini positioned on the same side of the membrane, though their exact orientation remains unclear (ElHattab2018MPV17related).

The protein is suggested to form a channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane, potentially facilitating the transport of small molecules such as nucleotides, which are crucial for mitochondrial DNA synthesis (Löllgen2014The). Structural analysis indicates that MPV17 may oligomerize under oxidative stress, forming a channel with a hollow cylinder structure, featuring a maximal opening of 12 Å at the N-terminal region and a narrow bottleneck of 3 Å (Meurant2024Indepth).

MPV17 interacts with the MICOS complex and Cyclophilin D, suggesting a role in mitochondrial calcium regulation and permeability transition pore function (Meurant2024Indepth). The protein's interaction with these complexes may influence its structural conformation and functional properties (Meurant2024Indepth).

## Function
The MPV17 gene encodes a protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability and function. MPV17 is involved in the regulation of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools within mitochondria, which are essential for proper mtDNA replication and maintenance (Dalla2016MPV17). The protein is thought to facilitate the uptake of cytosolic nucleotides into mitochondria, supporting the mitochondrial salvage pathway, which is vital for maintaining dNTP pools necessary for mtDNA replication, especially in non-dividing cells (Dalla2016MPV17; ElHattab2018MPV17related).

MPV17 is also implicated in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetic capacity. It is believed to function as a non-selective channel that helps maintain a high mitochondrial membrane potential, crucial for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production (Jacinto2021MPV17). Loss of MPV17 function can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by impaired mitochondrial respiration and energy production, highlighting its essential role in cellular energy metabolism (Jacinto2021MPV17). The protein's activity is critical for preventing mtDNA depletion and ensuring proper mitochondrial function, which is vital for overall organismal health (Dalla2016MPV17).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPV17 gene are associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS), particularly the hepatocerebral form, which primarily affects the liver and nervous system. This condition is characterized by early-onset liver dysfunction, developmental delay, and neurological symptoms such as hypotonia and seizures. Liver disease often progresses to failure during infancy or early childhood, and the prognosis is generally poor, with high mortality due to liver failure (Sperl2021NMR; ElHattab2018MPV17related).

MPV17 mutations can also lead to Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH), an autosomal recessive disorder prevalent in the Navajo population. NNH is characterized by severe sensory and motor neuropathy, corneal anesthesia, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, and liver disease (Wong2007Mutations). The clinical presentation of MPV17-related disorders is broad, with disease onset ranging from neonatal to adulthood, and symptoms can vary even with the same mutation (Löllgen2014The).

In some cases, MPV17 mutations result in a later-onset neuromyopathic disease with milder liver involvement and a better prognosis. These mutations often lead to a tissue-specific reduction of mitochondrial DNA, affecting the liver more severely than other tissues (Sperl2021NMR; Uusimaa2013Clinical).

## Interactions
MPV17 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that participates in various interactions crucial for its function. It forms oligomeric pore structures in lipid bilayers, a process influenced by oxidative stress and mediated by disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues (Sperl2021NMR). MPV17's oligomerization is redox-regulated, with reducing agents like dithiothreitol (DTT) decreasing oligomer formation, indicating that its oligomeric state is sensitive to the redox environment (Sperl2021NMR).

MPV17 interacts with the protease Omi/HtrA2, which helps prevent mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing membrane potential. This interaction is significant as Omi/HtrA2 deficiency can lead to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage (Antonenkov2015The). MPV17 is also part of a high molecular weight complex that is essential for mtDNA maintenance and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism. Mutations in MPV17 can disrupt the formation of this complex, affecting its stability and function (Gilberti2018Pathological).

These interactions highlight MPV17's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, particularly under stress conditions, by forming channels and interacting with other mitochondrial proteins and complexes.
