growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family. VEGFR family members are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which contain an extracellular ligand-binding region with seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a tyrosine kinase (TK) domain within the cytoplasmic domain. This protein binds to VEGFR-A, VEGFR-B and placental growth factor and plays an important role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Expression of this receptor is found in vascular endothelial cells, placental trophoblast cells and peripheral blood monocytes. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Isoforms include a full-length transmembrane receptor isoform and shortened, soluble isoforms. The soluble isoforms are associated with the onset of pre-eclampsia.[provided by RefSeq, May 2009].", "symbol": "FLT1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C0812298"}, "unigene": "Hs.594454", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P17948", "TrEMBL": ["A0A1W2PNW4", "L7RSL3"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "FLT1"}}
