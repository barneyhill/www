# RBM38

## Overview
RBM38 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 38, a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM), which enables it to bind to specific RNA sequences, thereby influencing mRNA stability, translation, and alternative splicing. As a regulatory protein, RBM38 plays significant roles in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and senescence. It is particularly noted for its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53, modulating its activity by affecting the translation of p53 mRNA and alleviating microRNA-mediated repression of p53 target genes (Zhang2014Mice; Léveillé2011Selective). RBM38's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can alter its interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules (Zhang2019Serine). The protein's expression and activity are implicated in various cancers, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Mohibi2019Cancer; Zou2020RBM38).

## Structure
RBM38 is a protein encoded by the RBM38 gene, characterized by the presence of an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is crucial for its RNA-binding capabilities. The RRM domain includes two conserved sequences, RNP1 and RNP2, essential for binding to single-stranded RNA, typically interacting with regions of 2-6 nucleotides (Muraoka2020Rbm38). The primary structure of RBM38 includes a conserved RRM domain, which facilitates RNA binding through beta-sheets and alpha-helices, forming a stable RNA-binding surface (Zou2020RBM38).

RBM38 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. The predominant isoform, RBM38a, consists of 239 amino acids and retains the RNA-binding properties necessary for modulating mRNA post-transcriptionally. RBM38b, a shorter isoform with 121 amino acids, results from exon 4 skipping. The newly identified RBM38c isoform encodes 271 amino acids and includes a cryptic short exon 2, which disrupts the RNP1 motif by inserting an extra 32 amino acids (Zou2020RBM38).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in RBM38's function. Phosphorylation at Serine 195, for instance, alters its interaction with the Ago2-miR203 complex, affecting mRNA stability and translation (Zhang2019Serine). These structural features and modifications enable RBM38 to regulate various cellular processes, including mRNA stability and translation.

## Function
RBM38, also known as RNA binding motif protein 38, is a crucial regulator of post-transcriptional gene expression in human cells. It primarily functions by binding to RNA, influencing mRNA stability, translation, and alternative splicing. RBM38 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) that allows it to interact with AU/U-rich elements in target mRNAs, thereby modulating their stability and translation (Mohibi2019Cancer; Heinicke2013The).

In the context of cell biology, RBM38 plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle, differentiation, and senescence. It is involved in the modulation of p53 activity, a critical tumor suppressor protein, by affecting the translation of p53 mRNA and alleviating microRNA-mediated repression of p53 target genes such as p21, DDIT4, and LATS2 (Zhang2014Mice; Léveillé2011Selective). RBM38 is also implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing during erythroid differentiation, particularly affecting the splicing of the EPB41 gene, which is essential for red blood cell deformability (Heinicke2013The).

RBM38 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it impacts processes like cell proliferation and differentiation. Its expression is upregulated in response to DNA damage, which is necessary for maintaining normal p21 levels and inducing cell cycle arrest (Léveillé2011Selective). Overall, RBM38's regulatory functions are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress conditions.

## Clinical Significance
RBM38 plays a significant role in cancer biology, with its expression and mutations impacting various cancers. It often acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is linked to poor survival in cancers such as renal cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (Zou2020RBM38). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RBM38 overexpression reduces tumorigenesis by stabilizing the p53-MDM2 loop, which is crucial for controlling cell growth and apoptosis (Ye2018RBM38). 

RBM38 mutations, such as S195L and Y192C, affect p53 expression by altering its interaction with eIF4E, influencing cancer progression. The S195L mutation decreases p53 expression, promoting cell proliferation, while Y192C increases p53 expression, suggesting a tumor-suppressive effect (Sun2021Finetuning). 

RBM38's role is context-dependent, as it can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. It is overexpressed in canine lymphoma and associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and colorectal adenoma transformation (Mohibi2019Cancer). In breast cancer, RBM38 expression is often reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, impairing p53's ability to activate target genes, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Léveillé2011Selective).

## Interactions
RBM38, an RNA-binding protein, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. It plays a significant role in modulating microRNA (miRNA) accessibility, particularly by inhibiting miRNA function on target mRNAs. RBM38 restricts the accessibility of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) to p21 mRNA, thereby interfering with miRNA-mediated repression (Léveillé2011Selective). It also interacts with the AU-rich-element-binding protein HuR to regulate p21 mRNA stability, although this interaction is not fully explored (Léveillé2011Selective).

RBM38 competes with miR-92a-3p for binding to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the PTEN mRNA, stabilizing PTEN expression and inhibiting colorectal cancer progression (Guan2021RNA‐binding). It also interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, modulating p53 mRNA translation. This interaction is influenced by the phosphorylation status of RBM38, particularly at serine-195, which affects p53 expression levels (Sun2021Finetuning).

RBM38's interactions extend to the p53 family, where it forms a feedback loop by destabilizing p63 and stabilizing p73, while also repressing p53 translation (Zou2020RBM38). These interactions highlight RBM38's complex role in post-transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
