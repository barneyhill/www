# PPM1L

## Overview
PPM1L is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1L, a member of the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family of serine/threonine phosphatases. This protein is characterized by its requirement for divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for catalytic activity (Kamada2020Metaldependent). PPM1L is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ceramide trafficking and ER stress responses (Kusano2016Targeted; Kamada2020Metaldependent). The protein plays a critical role in dephosphorylating key signaling molecules, such as TAK1 and IRE1α, thereby modulating pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular stress (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Seumen2021Protein). PPM1L's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions such as obesity, cancer, and cardiac dysfunction (Wang2019Phosphatase; Song2022circFAM120B).

## Structure
PPM1L is a member of the PP2C family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain that requires divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains a transmembrane domain in its N-terminal region, which interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA) (Kamada2020Metaldependent). This transmembrane domain is crucial for its localization to the ER-Golgi membrane contact sites, where it is involved in ceramide trafficking (Shinoda2012Acyl‐CoA).

PPM1L does not contain any long insert sequences in the turns within its catalytic domain, suggesting a structural similarity to other PPM phosphatases like PPM1A or PPM1B (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The interaction with acyl-CoA binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) is mediated by the GOLD domain of ACBD3, which recruits PPM1L to the Golgi apparatus (Shinoda2012Acyl‐CoA). The catalytic domain of PPM1L is involved in dephosphorylating proteins such as TAK1 and IRE1α, playing a role in various signaling pathways (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Seumen2021Protein). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in the context of obesity and inflammatory responses (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Function
PPM1L is a serine-threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by dephosphorylating specific proteins. It is a member of the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) superfamily and acts as a negative regulator of the TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, which are essential for transcription regulation and apoptosis (Thean2009Genome‐wide). PPM1L is involved in the dephosphorylation of TAK1, a kinase in these pathways, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Thean2009Genome‐wide).

In healthy human cells, PPM1L is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi membrane contact sites, where it interacts with proteins such as ACBD3 and VAPA. This localization is important for its role in ceramide trafficking and the regulation of ER stress responses (Kusano2016Targeted; Kamada2020Metaldependent). PPM1L also dephosphorylates the IRE1α protein, implicating it in the IRE1 signaling pathway, which is associated with adipocyte maturation and potentially anti-obesity drug development (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

PPM1L is highly expressed in the central nervous system during development, playing a significant role in brain development and motor performance (Kusano2016Targeted). Its deficiency can lead to structural abnormalities in the brain, highlighting its importance in neural development (Kusano2016Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPM1L gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PPM1L acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is downregulated in ESCC tissues, and this reduction is associated with increased tumorigenicity. The interaction between circFAM120B and miR-661 affects PPM1L expression, with circFAM120B acting as a miRNA sponge to restore PPM1L levels, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Song2022circFAM120B).

PPM1L also plays a significant role in cardiac health, particularly following myocardial infarction (MI). Overexpression of PPM1L in transgenic mice has been shown to improve cardiac function and reduce myocardial injury post-MI. This protective effect is attributed to PPM1L's ability to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production by suppressing NF-kB signaling, which is crucial for inflammatory responses. The downregulation of PPM1L post-MI is associated with excessive inflammation and tissue injury, highlighting its importance in modulating inflammatory responses and preventing cardiac dysfunction (Wang2019Phosphatase).

These findings suggest that PPM1L has potential clinical significance in managing cancer progression and cardiac dysfunction through modulation of its expression or activity.

## Interactions
PPM1L interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It has been identified as a negative regulator of the interleukin-1-TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) signaling pathway through direct dephosphorylation of TAK1 (Kamada2020Metaldependent). PPM1L also interacts with the acyl-CoA binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3), which recruits it to the ER-Golgi membrane contact sites. This interaction is mediated by the GOLD domain of ACBD3 and is crucial for the dephosphorylation of the ceramide transport protein CERT, facilitating ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi (Shinoda2012Acyl‐CoA).

PPM1L is involved in the Inositol requiring protein -1 (IRE1) signaling pathway by dephosphorylating the IRE1α protein at Ser724 (Kamada2020Metaldependent). It also interacts with IKKβ, inhibiting its phosphorylation and activation, which suppresses NF-kB signaling and inflammatory cytokine production, particularly in the context of myocardial infarction (Wang2019Phosphatase).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PPM1L is targeted by miR-661, which enhances tumorigenicity by reducing PPM1L expression. This interaction is part of the circFAM120B/miR-661/PPM1L axis, where circFAM120B can sponge miR-661 to restore PPM1L expression, thereby inhibiting tumorigenicity (Song2022circFAM120B).
