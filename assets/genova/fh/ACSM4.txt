# ACSM4

## Overview
The ACSM4 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 4, which is a crucial component of the acyl-CoA synthetase family involved in fatty acid metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the activation of medium-chain fatty acids, converting them into acyl-CoA thioesters, which are essential for subsequent oxidation and energy production within cells. The protein is predominantly localized in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis through fatty acid degradation (GuzmánFulgencio2014ACSM4; Boomgaarden2009Comparative). Additionally, ACSM4 is uniquely expressed in the olfactory epithelium, indicating a potential role in odorant processing (Boomgaarden2009Comparative). The gene has also been implicated in the progression of diseases such as AIDS and triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (GuzmánFulgencio2014ACSM4; Alsaleem2020A).

## Structure


## Function
The ACSM4 gene encodes an enzyme that is a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, which plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the activation of medium-chain fatty acids by converting them into acyl-CoA thioesters, a critical step for their subsequent oxidation and energy production. This process is essential for the production of acetyl CoA through fatty acid oxidation, which is a key component of cellular energy metabolism (GuzmánFulgencio2014ACSM4). ACSM4 is primarily active in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, where it facilitates fatty acid degradation, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis (GuzmánFulgencio2014ACSM4; Boomgaarden2009Comparative).

In addition to its metabolic functions, ACSM4 is uniquely expressed in the olfactory epithelium, suggesting a potential role in processing odorants in a zone-specific manner (Boomgaarden2009Comparative). The enzyme's activity in these cellular locations underscores its importance in maintaining energy balance and metabolic regulation within the cell. The specific expression and function of ACSM4 in the olfactory system highlight its potential involvement in sensory processes, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Boomgaarden2009Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
The ACSM4 gene has been implicated in the progression of AIDS and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In the context of AIDS, specific polymorphisms in ACSM4, such as rs7137120 and rs7961991, have been associated with rapid disease progression in HIV-infected patients. These polymorphisms may influence ACSM4 expression, potentially affecting mitochondrial energetics and fatty acid metabolism, which are crucial in the immune response against HIV (GuzmánFulgencio2014ACSM4). The study by Hendrickson et al. also identified SNP rs7961991 in ACSM4 as significantly associated with AIDS progression, suggesting a role for ACSM4 in the pathogenesis of the disease (Hendrickson2010Genetic).

In TNBC, ACSM4 has been identified as part of a two-gene prognostic signature. Higher expression levels of ACSM4 are linked to worse outcomes, including shorter distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). This suggests that ACSM4 expression may serve as a prognostic marker for assessing risk and guiding treatment strategies in TNBC patients (Alsaleem2020A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACSM4 in both AIDS and cancer, emphasizing its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis.
