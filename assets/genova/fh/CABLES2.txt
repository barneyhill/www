# CABLES2

## Overview
CABLES2 (Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. The CABLES2 protein functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases like CDK3 and CDK5, as well as the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which are pivotal in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (Hasan2021Characterization). This protein is ubiquitously expressed in adult mouse tissues, with notable expression in the brain, testis, and ovary, indicating its role in diverse physiological processes (Hasan2021Characterization). CABLES2 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development. Its disruption is associated with embryonic lethality in mice, highlighting its essential role in early development and its involvement in key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and p53 (Dinh2021Disruption).

## Structure


## Function
CABLES2 (Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. The CABLES2 protein interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK3 and CDK5, as well as the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which are key regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Hasan2021Characterization). This interaction suggests that CABLES2 plays a role in modulating the activity of these kinases, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and development.

CABLES2 is expressed ubiquitously in adult mouse tissues, with high expression levels observed in the brain, testis, and ovary, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Hasan2021Characterization). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular functions and development. In particular, CABLES2 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptotic pathways, functioning in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners, which highlights its potential role in cell death and survival mechanisms (Dinh2021Disruption).

The disruption of CABLES2 has been associated with embryonic lethality in mice, underscoring its essential role in early development and its interaction with key signaling pathways such as Wnt/b-catenin and p53 (Dinh2021Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
CABLES2 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Alterations in CABLES2 expression or mutations can contribute to tumorigenesis and other pathological conditions. In humans, CABLES2 has been identified as a susceptibility gene or tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential role in cancer development (Dinh2021Disruption). The gene's interaction with the p53 pathway is significant, as disruptions can lead to enhanced p53 signaling, which is associated with increased apoptosis and growth retardation, contributing to embryonic lethality in mouse models (Dinh2021Disruption). 

The study of Cables2 in mice has shown that its complete deletion leads to embryonic lethality due to diminished expression of the Rps21 gene and enhanced p53 pathway activity, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be relevant in human diseases (Dinh2021Disruption). The interaction of CABLES2 with the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway also suggests its involvement in developmental processes and cancer, as altered transcriptional activation of Wnt-responsive genes has been observed in Cables2 mutant embryos (Dinh2021Disruption). These findings underscore the importance of CABLES2 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease when disrupted.

## Interactions
CABLES2, a member of the CABLES protein family, is known to interact with several key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. It physically associates with cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK3 and CDK5, as well as the c-Abl kinase, influencing their activity (Hasan2021Characterization). In Cables2 Tom/Tom knock-in mice, CABLES2 was shown to interact with CDK5 in the brain and testis, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Hasan2021Characterization).

CABLES2 also plays a role in early embryonic development by interacting with components of the Nodal and Wnt signaling pathways. It physically associates with Smad2, enhancing Smad2/FAST1-mediated transcription, and interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt pathway, to modulate transcriptional activity at Wnt-responsive genes (Dinh2021Disruption; Dinh2019Cables2). These interactions suggest that CABLES2 functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the formation of multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression during development (Dinh2019Cables2).

The interaction of CABLES2 with these proteins highlights its role in modulating various signaling pathways, which are crucial for processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and embryonic development.
