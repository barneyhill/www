# PLS3

## Overview
Plastin 3 (PLS3) is a gene that encodes an actin-bundling protein, which plays a pivotal role in the organization and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. The protein product, plastin 3, is categorized as an actin-bundling protein and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, mechanotransduction, and bone homeostasis. PLS3 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, notably in bone cells such as osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it contributes to bone development and maintenance. Additionally, plastin 3 is crucial in neuronal functions, including axonal growth and neurotransmission, and is implicated in conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy. Mutations in the PLS3 gene have been linked to osteogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its clinical significance in bone health and disease (Zhong2023The; Wolff2021Plastin; Schwebach2020Osteogenesis).

## Structure
Plastin 3 (PLS3) is an actin-bundling protein encoded by the PLS3 gene, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PLS3 includes an N-terminal calcium-binding regulatory domain (RD) and two actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD2), each composed of tandem calponin-homology (t-CH) domains (Schwebach2020Osteogenesis; Schwebach2017The). The RD contains two EF-hand motifs and a calmodulin-binding motif (CBM), which are crucial for calcium regulation (Schwebach2020Osteogenesis).

The secondary structure of PLS3 involves alpha helices and beta sheets, facilitating its interaction with actin filaments. The tertiary structure is compact, allowing efficient actin bundling (Schwebach2017The). The quaternary structure details are less defined, but the protein's ability to form complexes with actin is well-documented (Schwebach2017The).

PLS3 undergoes common post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interaction with other proteins (Schwebach2017The). The protein's structure and function are sensitive to calcium, with calcium binding inhibiting the actin-bundling activity of ABD2 while having minimal impact on ABD1's actin-binding ability (Schwebach2017The).

## Function
Plastin 3 (PLS3) is an actin-bundling protein that plays a critical role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes. PLS3 is involved in the binding and bundling of filamentous actin (F-actin), contributing to cell motility, migration, and the maintenance of cell structure and function (Zhong2023The; Wolff2021Plastin). It is particularly important in mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical signals into biochemical responses, influencing bone health and cellular mechanosensitivity (Zhong2023The; Wolff2021Plastin).

PLS3 is expressed in various solid tissues, including osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, where it plays a significant role in bone homeostasis and development (Zhong2023The). In osteocytes, PLS3 is enriched in dendrites and is crucial for mechanosensory functions, helping translate mechanical stimuli into cellular signals (Zhong2023The). It also regulates osteoblast mineralization, a process vital for bone formation, by modulating the response to extracellular matrix stiffness (Chin2023The).

In neurons, PLS3 is involved in axonal growth and neurotransmission, contributing to the maintenance of neuromuscular junctions and synaptic vesicle organization (Hennlein2023Plastin). Its role in endocytosis and intracellular calcium homeostasis is also significant, particularly in conditions like spinal muscular atrophy (Wolff2021Plastin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLS3 gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and low bone mineral density. These mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, from mild symptoms to severe osteoporosis and dysmorphia. Hemizygous males are generally more affected than heterozygous females, likely due to variability in X chromosome inactivation (Schwebach2021Plastin). Pathogenic variants of PLS3 include nonsense and frameshift mutations that result in premature stop codons, leading to mRNA degradation and loss of functional protein. Some missense mutations produce full-length proteins with altered calcium sensitivity, affecting actin bundling and cellular localization, which are crucial for bone formation (Schwebach2020Osteogenesis).

A novel missense variant, c.685G>A (p.Gly229Arg), was identified in a Croatian family with X-linked OI. This variant is predicted to be deleterious, although its pathogenicity is not fully established. The proband exhibited low bone mass and frequent fractures, while his mother and sister showed initial osteoporotic changes without fractures, highlighting the variability in clinical phenotypes due to X-linked inheritance (Brlek2021XLinked).

PLS3 mutations also impact calcium regulation of actin bundling, which is essential for bone health. Disruptions in this process can lead to osteoporosis by affecting the mechanotransduction pathways in osteoblasts and osteocytes (Schwebach2020Osteogenesis).

## Interactions
Plastin 3 (PLS3) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in actin bundling and cellular processes. PLS3 interacts with actin filaments through its actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD2), with ABD1 being the primary binding site and ABD2's interaction modulated by calcium (Schwebach2017The). Calcium binding to PLS3's EF-hand motifs regulates its actin-bundling activity, with higher calcium concentrations inhibiting this function (Lyon2013Calcium; Wolff2021Plastin).

PLS3 also interacts with Rab5, a marker of early endosomes, which suggests a role in endocytosis. This interaction is important for synaptic vesicle endocytosis and motor axon outgrowth, particularly in the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Lyon2013Calcium; Wolff2021Plastin). PLS3's interaction with Rab5 enhances endocytic activity, which is vital for neuronal function and maintenance (Wolff2021Plastin).

PLS3 is less sensitive to calcium compared to other plastin isoforms, which affects its ability to bundle F-actin. This differential sensitivity is due to the varying affinities of its EF-hand domains for calcium, influencing its structural and functional properties (Wolff2021Plastin).
