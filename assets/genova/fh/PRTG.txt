# PRTG

## Overview
Protogenin (PRTG) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling processes. The protein, also named protogenin, plays a crucial role in embryonic neurogenesis by maintaining neural progenitors in an undifferentiated state, thereby preventing premature neuronal differentiation (Wong2010Protogenin). Structurally, protogenin comprises multiple immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which facilitate its function as a cell adhesion molecule and its interactions with other proteins (Vesque2006Cloning; Takahashi2010Protogenin). The protein's interactions with molecules such as ERdj3 and Radil are essential for its role in neural development and cell migration (Wong2010Protogenin; Wang2013Protogenin). Additionally, PRTG has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its upregulation in gastric cancer and its involvement in cartilage integrity, highlighting its significance in both developmental biology and disease pathology (Song2013MicroRNA9; Xiang2021The).

## Structure
Protogenin (PRTG) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its primary structure consists of 1,191 amino acids, including a signal peptide, four immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, five fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Vesque2006Cloning; Takahashi2010Protogenin). The secondary structure of PRTG likely features beta-sheets typical of immunoglobulin folds, given its Ig domains. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains, contributing to its function as a cell adhesion molecule (Ito2011Protogenin).

PRTG's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, as it can form dimers or multimers, which is crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Wong2010Protogenin). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant, with PRTG being highly N-glycosylated, which affects its molecular mass and function (Watanabe2011Nuclear; Takahashi2010Protogenin). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, releasing an intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus, suggesting a role in signaling pathways (Watanabe2011Nuclear). No splice variant isoforms have been identified in the context provided (Takahashi2010Protogenin).

## Function
Protogenin (PRTG) is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in embryonic neurogenesis by acting as a receptor to prevent premature neuronal differentiation. It is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed in the neural tube of mouse embryos during early development stages (Wong2010Protogenin). PRTG functions as a gatekeeper, maintaining neural progenitors in an undifferentiated state, which is crucial for proper neurodevelopment (Wong2010Protogenin). 

PRTG interacts with ERdj3, a stress-inducible endoplasmic reticulum DnaJ homolog, to form a signaling pathway that suppresses neuronal differentiation (Wong2010Protogenin). This interaction is essential for regulating the timing of neuronal differentiation, ensuring that neural progenitor cells do not differentiate prematurely (Wong2010Protogenin). 

In addition to its role in neurogenesis, PRTG is involved in cell adhesion processes within the paraxial mesodermal lineage, facilitating cell rearrangement and migration necessary for mesoderm development (Ito2011Protogenin). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, releasing an intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus, potentially playing a role in signaling for neural differentiation and cell adhesion (Watanabe2011Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
The PRTG gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, PRTG is significantly upregulated, particularly in the context of Helicobacter pylori infection. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to increased cellular proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance in gastric cancer cells. The transcription factor ZEB1 enhances PRTG expression, which activates the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway, promoting tumorigenic activities. Targeting this pathway with inhibitors like KT5823 has shown potential in reversing these effects and improving treatment outcomes (Xiang2021The).

In the context of cartilage integrity, PRTG overexpression is associated with decreased precartilage condensation and increased apoptotic cell death, which can be counteracted by microRNA-9 (miR-9). This interaction is crucial in maintaining cartilage integrity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Reduced miR-9 levels lead to increased PRTG expression, contributing to chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage degradation (Song2013MicroRNA9).

## Interactions
Protogenin (PRTG) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neural development and cell adhesion. PRTG interacts with Radil, a Rap1 GTPase interactor, which is essential for the migration of neural crest cells (NCCs). This interaction is mediated through the cytoplasmic domain of PRTG, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and immunoprecipitation experiments. Radil, when overexpressed, localizes in the cytoplasm, but in the presence of PRTG, it translocates to the plasma membrane, indicating recruitment by PRTG (Wang2013Protogenin).

PRTG also interacts with α5β1-integrin, a critical component for cell migration and survival. The ERdj3/Prtg/Radil signaling pathway promotes cell migration by inducing the expression of high-affinity α5β1-integrin on the cell surface (Wang2013Protogenin). PRTG can co-precipitate with endogenous β1-integrin, indicating a direct interaction, and its absence leads to reduced expression of activated α5β1-integrin, affecting cell migration (Wang2013Protogenin).

Additionally, PRTG binds to intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5) and other proteins such as WFIKKN2, lactotransferrin (LTF), interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha (IL-6Ra), and ISLR2/LINX, which are involved in various biological processes, including nervous system development and immune response (Wojtowicz2020A).
