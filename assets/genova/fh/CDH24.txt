# CDH24

## Overview
CDH24 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 24, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is known for its role in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. Cadherin 24 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular communication through the formation of adherens junctions (An2014Frameshift). The protein is characterized by its nine extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, which are essential for its adhesive function and are stabilized by calcium ions (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). Primarily expressed in osteoblast cells, cadherin 24 is involved in bone development and maintenance, contributing to heterogeneous cell sorting and tissue architecture (Pal2018Cadherin). While its specific role in cancer remains unreported, CDH24's interactions with proteins such as p120 and β-catenin suggest its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Berx2009Involvement).

## Structure
CDH24, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is characterized by its extracellular domain structure, which includes nine extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats in humans (Hulpiau2009Molecular). These EC repeats are involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion, a hallmark of cadherin proteins (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). Type II cadherins, including CDH24, are distinguished by the presence of two conserved tryptophan residues at the second and fourth positions in the EC1 domain, which are crucial for their adhesive function (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

The protein's structure is stabilized by calcium ions, which bind at three sites between each EC domain, forming a rigid rod-like arrangement that facilitates homophilic interactions (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The conserved NxxPxF motif is located between the predicted cleavage site and the EC1 domain, contributing to the protein's structural integrity (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

CDH24 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization. The presence of splice variant isoforms could potentially alter the protein's function or cellular localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CDH24, or cadherin 24, is a homophilic calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein that plays a significant role in bone development and maintenance. It is primarily expressed in osteoblast cells, where it facilitates cell adhesion processes crucial for the formation and maintenance of bone tissue (Pal2018Cadherin). This protein is involved in heterogeneous cell sorting, which is essential for maintaining proper tissue architecture and function (Pal2018Cadherin).

CDH24 is part of the cadherin family, which are transmembrane proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion by forming adherens junctions. These junctions are vital for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular communication (An2014Frameshift). Although CDH24 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, its specific function in cancer has not been reported, suggesting its primary role is in maintaining normal cellular adhesion and tissue structure (An2014Frameshift).

At the molecular level, CDH24 is active at the cell membrane, where it engages in calcium-dependent interactions to mediate strong cell-cell adhesion. This activity is crucial for the structural integrity of tissues and proper cellular communication (An2014Frameshift).

## Interactions
Cadherin 24 (CDH24) is known to participate in cell-cell adhesion through its interactions with specific proteins. It binds to p120 and β-catenin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling, suggesting that CDH24 can mediate strong cell-cell adhesion (Berx2009Involvement). These interactions are important for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby stabilizing cell junctions.

CDH24 is also described as a homophilic calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein, indicating that it can engage in interactions with itself or similar cadherins to facilitate cell adhesion (Pal2018Cadherin). This homophilic binding is characteristic of cadherins and is essential for their role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance.

While CDH24's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its ability to bind p120 and β-catenin highlights its potential involvement in multiprotein complexes that regulate cell adhesion and signaling pathways. The specific physical interactions of CDH24 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these are not well-documented in the available literature (Polanco2021Differential; Hulpiau2009Molecular).
