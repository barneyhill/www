# TNR

## Overview
The TNR gene encodes the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin R (TN-R), which is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. TN-R is a member of the tenascin family of proteins, characterized by its modular structure comprising epidermal growth factor-like domains, fibronectin type III repeats, and a fibrinogen-like sequence (Carnemolla1996Human). This glycoprotein plays a critical role in neural development and function, including synaptic plasticity, neural cell adhesion, and myelination (Pesheva1997TenascinR). TN-R is integral to the formation of perineuronal nets, which are essential for regulating neuronal plasticity and maintaining the structural integrity of neural networks (Wagner2020Loss). Mutations in the TNR gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in brain development and cognitive function (Dufresne2012Homozygous; Wagner2020Loss).

## Structure
The human tenascin-R (TN-R) protein is a modular glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of 1358 amino acids, including a typical signal peptide and a domain organization similar to that of rat and chicken TN-R (Carnemolla1996Human). The protein features 4.5 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-L) domains, 9 fibronectin type III (FN-L) repeats, and a fibrinogen-like sequence (Carnemolla1996Human). 

Alternative splicing of TN-R pre-mRNA results in isoforms, with one human isoform missing a fibronectin-like repeat (Carnemolla1996Human). This splicing variation contributes to the diversity of TN-R's functional roles in the central nervous system. 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in TN-R, which can influence its interactions and stability. The protein can form hexameric structures through disulfide bonds, contributing to its quaternary structure and functional properties in the extracellular matrix (Pesheva1997TenascinR).

TN-R is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, supporting cell adhesion through a sulfatide-mediated mechanism (Pesheva1997TenascinR).

## Function
Tenascin R (TNR) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in various neural processes. TNR is involved in synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning, memory, and cognition (Dufresne2012Homozygous). It contributes to the formation of perineuronal nets, specialized structures that ensheath interneurons and are important for terminating the critical period of neuronal plasticity (Rathjen2021Early; Wagner2020Loss). These nets are composed of proteoglycans and hyaluronan, with TNR being essential for crosslinking these components (Wagner2020Loss).

TNR also plays a significant role in neural cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and modulation of sodium channel function, which are vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neural networks (Hawi2018A). It interacts with various proteins, including IgCAM members and extracellular matrix proteins, influencing cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Rathjen2021Early). TNR is involved in the differentiation and adhesion of oligodendrocytes, promoting myelination in the central nervous system (Pesheva1997TenascinR). Its expression is crucial for regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, particularly influencing the generation of inhibitory interneurons (Xu2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNR gene, which encodes the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R, are associated with a nonprogressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by spasticity and transient opisthotonus. This condition is linked to biallelic variants in TNR, including both loss-of-function and missense mutations, which lead to symptoms such as spastic para- or tetraparesis, axial muscular hypotonia, developmental delay, and transient opisthotonus (Wagner2020Loss). Brain MRI findings in affected individuals often show delayed myelination and corpus callosum abnormalities (Wagner2020Loss).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, TNR mutations have been implicated in intellectual disability. A case study reported a child with intellectual disability and transient choreoathetosis due to a homozygous deletion involving the TNR gene, highlighting its role in brain development and cognition (Dufresne2012Homozygous). TNR deficiency in mice has been shown to result in increased anxiety, impaired motor coordination, and cognitive deficits, suggesting that alterations in TNR expression or function could contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism (Freitag2003Behavioral; Xu2013The).

## Interactions
Tenascin R (TNR) is involved in various interactions within the central nervous system, playing a crucial role in neural cell adhesion and synaptic plasticity. TNR interacts with the neuronal receptor F3/F11/contactin, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is important for cell recognition and adhesion. This interaction can lead to neurite repulsion and defasciculation, mediated by the binding of TNR's amino-terminal domain to the Ig-like domains of F3/F11/contactin (Weber1999Mice).

TNR also forms a complex with L1 and Fyn tyrosine kinase, where clustering of F3/F11/contactin at the cell surface can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, including Fyn, suggesting a role in signal transduction (Weber1999Mice). Additionally, TNR interacts with the beta2 subunit of sodium channels, potentially influencing their localization and regulation at nodes of Ranvier (Weber1999Mice).

In the extracellular matrix, TNR binds with high affinity to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans such as phosphacan and versican, indicating its involvement in modulating the properties of intercellular spaces (Weber1999Mice). TNR's interaction with these molecules underscores its multifunctionality in the central nervous system.
