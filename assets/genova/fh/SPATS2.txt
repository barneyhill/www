# SPATS2

## Overview
SPATS2, or spermatogenesis associated serine rich 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The SPATS2 protein is characterized by its serine-rich composition and is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, making it a significant player in oncogenic pathways. It interacts with several key proteins and nucleic acids, influencing the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and is involved in pathways such as the TRIM44-STAT3 signaling pathway (Chen2021Inhibition; Liu2021High). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, which modulate its role in cancer progression (Yan2022SPATS2; Dong2020SPATS2). Due to its involvement in cancer cell cycle regulation and its association with poor prognosis in cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, SPATS2 is considered a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Dong2020SPATS2; Lin2023SPATS2).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The SPATS2 gene is significantly implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including advanced tumor stages, vascular invasion, and reduced overall and disease-free survival rates (Dong2020SPATS2). SPATS2 promotes HCC cell proliferation and invasion by modulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as downregulating p21 and p27 and upregulating EZH2, survivin, c-myc, and cyclin D1 (Dong2020SPATS2). Knockdown of SPATS2 in HCC cells leads to decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Chen2021Inhibition).

SPATS2 is also involved in the TRIM44-STAT3 signaling pathway, where its knockdown results in reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 and decreased expression of cancer cell-intrinsic hallmarks like BCL2 and MMP9 (Chen2021Inhibition). High SPATS2 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, which is linked to worse prognosis in HCC patients (Lin2023SPATS2).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high SPATS2 expression is associated with poor patient prognosis and promotes tumorigenicity by affecting key proteins involved in cancer progression (Liu2021High). These findings highlight SPATS2 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
SPATS2 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cancer progression. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), SPATS2 affects the expression of key proteins such as cyclin E, MMP-9, N-cadherin, and P53, indicating its role in cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Liu2021High). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPATS2 interacts with DLGAP5, a protein involved in oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle, and DNA repair pathways (Lin2023SPATS2). SPATS2 is also regulated by miR-145-5p, a microRNA that binds to its 3'-UTR, reducing its expression and thereby inhibiting HCC cell proliferation and invasion (Dong2020SPATS2).

SPATS2 is a downstream target of the long noncoding RNA SNHG5, which promotes its expression by regulating DNMT3a, a DNA methyltransferase. This interaction involves the hypomethylation of the SPATS2 promoter, enhancing its expression in HCC (Yan2022SPATS2). These interactions highlight SPATS2's role in cancer cell cycle regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
