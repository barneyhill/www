# MRPS26

## Overview
MRPS26 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S26, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy production (Xie2005A; Dennerlein2010Human). MRPS26 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity, playing roles in apoptotic signaling and DNA damage response, particularly in the context of p53 perturbations (Prokopidis2022Aberrant). The protein's interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome, including its association with 12S mitochondrial rRNA and other ribosomal proteins, underscore its importance in ribosomal assembly and function (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural). Dysregulation of MRPS26 has been linked to various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Prokopidis2022Aberrant).

## Function
MRPS26 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S26) is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the small 28S subunit, which is crucial for protein synthesis within mitochondria. This protein plays a significant role in translating mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, a process vital for cellular energy production (Xie2005A). MRPS26 is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, ensuring the proper synthesis of proteins that are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Dennerlein2010Human).

In healthy human cells, MRPS26 is involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway signaling and DNA damage response, particularly in the context of p53 perturbations. It is also implicated in the mitochondrial activity of muscle stem cells, suggesting its role in mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular energy balance (Prokopidis2022Aberrant). The protein's function is critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to various diseases if disrupted (Prokopidis2022Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS26 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MRPS26 is significantly dysregulated, showing opposing expression patterns compared to musculoskeletal ageing. This dysregulation is associated with reduced overall survival and decreased tumor purity in NSCLC patients. MRPS26 is linked to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway signaling and DNA damage response, which are crucial in cancer progression (Prokopidis2022Aberrant).

The expression of MRPS26 is also noted in lung and gastric cancers, where it is upregulated, suggesting a role in these malignancies (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). Although specific diseases or conditions directly caused by MRPS26 gene mutations are not detailed, its involvement in mitochondrial activity and potential mitochondrial dysfunction is highlighted. This dysfunction can contribute to diseases such as cancer, as mitochondrial degeneration is a factor in muscle atrophy-induced cancer cachexia (Prokopidis2022Aberrant).

MRPS26 is also a late-assembly protein that binds near other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins with known deleterious mutations, indicating its potential involvement in conditions related to mitochondrial ribosomal RNA structure and function (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).

## Interactions
MRPS26, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (mtSSU), is involved in several interactions crucial for mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function. It interacts with the 12S mitochondrial rRNA, where it plays a role in recognizing and stabilizing specific RNA structures. This interaction involves a quaternary structure where base 62G (m.709G) forms hydrogen bonds with Arg 48 of MRPS34/mS34, providing a recognition surface for MRPS26/mS26. Additionally, 63U (m.710U) is stacked between 62G (m.709G) and Arg 30 of MRPS26/mS26, participating in a water-mediated hydrogen bonding interaction with 62G (m.709G) N7 (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).

MRPS26 is also associated with the protein C4orf14, which interacts specifically with the 28S mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This interaction was demonstrated through TAP experiments and SILAC coupled to Orbitrap LC/MS/MS analysis, indicating a strong association between MRPS26 and C4orf14, suggesting a role in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (He2012Human).

Furthermore, MRPS26 is identified as a late-assembly protein that binds near MRPS16/bS16m and MRPS22/mS22, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).
