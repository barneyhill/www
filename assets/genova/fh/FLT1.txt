# FLT1

## Overview
FLT1, or fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 1, is a gene that encodes the protein VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), a receptor tyrosine kinase integral to the processes of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. This protein is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and monocytes, where it binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) with high affinity, playing a pivotal role in modulating vascular development and permeability (Wakiya1996A; Clauss1996The). VEGFR-1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular region with seven immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, although it exhibits lower kinase activity compared to other VEGF receptors (Shibuya2001Structure; Shibuya2012Vascular). The receptor exists in both a membrane-bound form and a soluble form (sFlt-1), the latter acting as an endogenous inhibitor of VEGF, thereby regulating angiogenesis (SHIBUYA2011Involvement; Shibuya2012Vascular). FLT1's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, tumor growth, and preeclampsia, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2015Decreased; Gray2018Genetic).

## Structure
FLT1, also known as VEGFR-1, is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in angiogenesis. The protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct domains. The extracellular region of FLT1 contains seven immunoglobulin-like domains that are crucial for binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with high affinity (Herley1999Characterization; Shibuya2012Vascular). The transmembrane domain anchors the receptor in the cell membrane, while the intracellular region contains a tyrosine kinase domain, which is involved in signal transduction (Shibuya2001Structure).

FLT1 has a unique kinase insert sequence of about 60 amino acids within its tyrosine kinase domain, which differentiates it from other receptor types (Shibuya2012Vascular). The receptor exists in two major forms: a full-length membrane-bound receptor and a soluble form known as sFlt-1. The soluble form acts as an endogenous VEGF inhibitor by trapping VEGF, thus regulating angiogenesis (SHIBUYA2011Involvement; Shibuya2012Vascular).

Post-translational modifications of FLT1 include phosphorylation, which is typical for tyrosine kinase receptors, although FLT1 has lower kinase activity compared to VEGFR-2 (Shibuya2012Vascular). The receptor's structure and function are essential for its role in vascular development and disease processes.

## Function
The FLT1 gene encodes the Flt-1 protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase known as VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), which plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Flt-1 is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and monocytes, where it binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) with high affinity (Wakiya1996A; Clauss1996The). In endothelial cells, Flt-1 modulates cell migration and actin reorganization through the activation of p38 MAP kinase, which is essential for cell motility (Kanno2000Roles). This receptor is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis by modulating the availability of VEGF for other receptors, particularly VEGFR-2, which is the main transducer of angiogenic signals (SHIBUYA2011Involvement).

Flt-1 also plays a role in tissue factor production and chemotaxis in monocytes, indicating its involvement in procoagulant activity and monocyte recruitment (Clauss1996The). The receptor's activity is crucial during embryogenesis, tumor growth, and wound healing, as it regulates blood vessel formation and vascular permeability (Wakiya1996A; Clauss1996The). Additionally, Flt-1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of endothelial cells, with specific DNA motifs in its promoter region contributing to its expression (Wakiya1996A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FLT1 gene are implicated in several diseases, notably preeclampsia and certain cancers. In preeclampsia, fetal DNA variants near the FLT1 gene, such as the rs4769613[C] risk allele, are associated with an increased risk of late-onset preeclampsia, particularly in pregnancies with non-small-for-gestational-age infants. These genetic variants are located in placental enhancer regions and may influence FLT1 expression, although no direct association with FLT1 protein levels in placentas has been found (Gray2018Genetic). Elevated levels of the FLT1 splice variant sFLT1, an antiangiogenic factor, are linked to the clinical features of preeclampsia, contributing to hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy (Gray2018Genetic).

In cancer, FLT1 expression is also significant. In renal cancer cells, hypermethylation of the FLT1 promoter can lead to decreased efficacy of anti-VEGF/VEGFR drugs, suggesting that FLT1 hypermethylation could serve as a biomarker for predicting drug response (Kim2015Decreased). In choriocarcinoma, FLT1 promoter hypermethylation suppresses sFLT1 production, promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth. Treatment with demethylating agents can restore sFLT1 expression, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in inhibiting tumor growth (Sasagawa2020Production).

## Interactions
FLT1, also known as VEGFR-1, participates in several significant protein interactions that influence its role in angiogenesis and cell migration. One notable interaction is with Protein Tyrosine Kinase 7 (PTK7), forming a receptor complex that is crucial for the phosphorylation and activation of FLT1. This interaction is enhanced by VEGF-A, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways involving Akt and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which are essential for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Lee2011Flt-1).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT1 forms a macromolecular signaling complex with hERG1 K+ channels and β1 integrin. This complex is vital for FLT1 signaling activation and AML cell migration. The hERG1B isoform is specifically recruited into this complex, and its activity is necessary for the pro-migratory phenotype of AML cells. Blocking hERG1 channels inhibits FLT1 signaling and cell migration, highlighting the importance of this interaction in leukemia progression (Pillozzi2007VEGFR1).

FLT1 also interacts with small GTPases CDC42 and Rac1, mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, which are involved in its antiproliferative effects on endothelial cells (Zeng2002Flt1mediated).
