# RPA2

## Overview
RPA2 is a gene that encodes the replication protein A2, a critical component of the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) complex. This complex is essential for DNA metabolism, including replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance. The RPA2 protein is characterized by its ability to bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affinity, thereby stabilizing DNA intermediates during these processes. As a part of the RPA complex, RPA2 plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by protecting ssDNA from degradation and facilitating the proper progression of DNA replication forks. Additionally, RPA2 is involved in the DNA damage response, where its phosphorylation modulates interactions with other proteins, influencing DNA repair and checkpoint activation (Byrne2019Replication; Wold1997REPLICATION; Caldwell2020Dynamic). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various genetic disorders and cancers, where mutations or altered expression can lead to genomic instability and disease progression (Algethami2023Unravelling; Kochman2024HeterozygousRPA2variant).

## Structure
The RPA2 protein is a subunit of the heterotrimeric replication protein A complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. The primary structure of RPA2 consists of a specific amino acid sequence that contributes to its function in the complex. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common structural motifs in proteins (Madru2022DNAbinding).

In terms of tertiary structure, RPA2 folds into a stable three-dimensional conformation that is essential for its interaction with other subunits and DNA. The quaternary structure of RPA2 involves its assembly with the RPA1 and RPA3 subunits, forming a functional complex that binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Yates2018A).

RPA2 contains specific domains, such as the DNA-binding domain, which is critical for its role in stabilizing ssDNA during replication and repair processes. The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Millership2004Functional). These modifications can influence the DNA-binding capability of RPA2, as seen in its ability to be phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (Millership2004Functional).

## Function
RPA2, a subunit of the replication protein A (RPA) complex, plays a critical role in various DNA metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance. RPA2 binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affinity, stabilizing it during replication and repair processes, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability (Wold1997REPLICATION; Caldwell2020Dynamic).

In DNA replication, RPA2 is crucial for protecting ssDNA from degradation and preventing unscheduled binding by other proteins. It facilitates the handoff of ssDNA to downstream proteins, ensuring proper DNA synthesis and replication fork progression (Caldwell2020Dynamic). RPA2 also plays a significant role in the DNA damage response, where its phosphorylation is essential for directing the context-specific functions of the RPA complex, influencing DNA repair and checkpoint activation (Byrne2019Replication).

RPA2 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins involved in DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination. These interactions are crucial for coordinating DNA metabolism and maintaining cell cycle progression (Braun1997Role; Zou2006Functions). Through these activities, RPA2 contributes to the prevention of genomic instability and the maintenance of cellular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RPA2 gene have significant clinical implications. The Y256C mutation in RPA2 is identified as a novel genetic cause of telomere biology disorders (TBDs). This mutation impairs the interaction between RPA2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3, leading to reduced ubiquitination of RPA2, which affects the ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway and homologous recombination-directed repair. Consequently, this mutation results in telomere instability, characterized by telomere shortening, deletions, and fusions, and is associated with conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, and liver disease (Kochman2024HeterozygousRPA2variant).

In breast cancer, low expression of RPA2 is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis. It is associated with high nuclear grade, larger tumor size, and poor breast cancer-specific survival, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy. Low RPA2 expression is also correlated with a triple-negative phenotype in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancers, indicating a potential role in cancer pathogenesis and treatment resistance (Algethami2023Unravelling). These findings highlight the importance of RPA2 in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Replication Protein A2 (RPA2) is a subunit of the heterotrimeric Replication Protein A (RPA) complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA metabolism, including replication, repair, and recombination. RPA2 interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affinity, stabilizing DNA intermediates during these processes (Millership2004Functional).

RPA2 is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for DNA damage response and genome stability. It interacts with proteins such as ATRIP, RAD51, and p53, which are critical for ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling and DNA repair pathways (LindseyBoltz2012In). The phosphorylation of RPA2 is significant for its role in these interactions, particularly in ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling, where it modulates the recruitment of substrates like p53 and Rad17-RFC to RPA-ssDNA complexes (LindseyBoltz2012In).

In the context of tumor suppression, RPA2 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein menin. This interaction is crucial for the tumor suppressor activity of menin, particularly in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Computational studies have identified specific binding sites on menin for RPA2, suggesting stable interactions that may be affected by point mutations in menin (Kaur2023Investigating). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RPA2 in maintaining genomic integrity and its involvement in critical cellular processes.
