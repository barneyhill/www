# PUS3

## Overview
The PUS3 gene encodes the enzyme pseudouridine synthase 3, which is a critical component of RNA modification processes. This enzyme belongs to the class of pseudouridine synthases, which are responsible for catalyzing the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in RNA molecules. Pseudouridine synthase 3 is particularly involved in the modification of transfer RNA (tRNA), where it targets uridines at specific positions to enhance the stability and functionality of the tRNA structure. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining the proper three-dimensional conformation of tRNA, which is crucial for accurate and efficient protein synthesis. PUS3 is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, indicating its broad role in cellular RNA processing. Mutations in the PUS3 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in human health and development (Nøstvik2021Clinical; Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic).

## Function
The PUS3 gene encodes the enzyme pseudouridine synthase 3, which is crucial for the modification of RNA molecules, particularly transfer RNA (tRNA). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine (Ψ), a modification that enhances the stability and function of RNA. PUS3 specifically modifies uridines at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of tRNA, which is essential for maintaining the three-dimensional structure and stability of tRNAs, thereby impacting anticodon recognition and ensuring translational efficiency and accuracy (Nøstvik2021Clinical; Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic).

In humans, PUS3 is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in tRNA modifications. This activity is vital for normal cellular growth and function, as well as for proper translation processes (Nøstvik2021Clinical; Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). Beyond tRNA, PUS3 also targets mRNA and non-coding RNA, suggesting a broader role in regulating gene expression. It is involved in modifying steroid receptor activator RNA, indicating its potential regulatory role in gene expression (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). Impairments in PUS3 function can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in brain health and development (Nøstvik2021Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PUS3 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, hypotonia, and microcephaly. These conditions arise due to the gene's role in RNA modification, specifically the pseudouridylation of tRNA, which is crucial for proper RNA function and stability (Nøstvik2021Clinical; Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). Biallelic variants in PUS3 have been identified as a rare cause of these disorders, with clinical manifestations ranging from moderate to severe (Nøstvik2021Clinical).

A homozygous truncating mutation in PUS3 has been linked to intellectual disability, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining normal cognitive development (Ding2024Implications). The mutation results in reduced levels of pseudouridylation at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of tRNA, which is critical for mitochondrial function in muscle and brain tissues (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). This deficiency can lead to translational deficiencies, particularly affecting tissues sensitive to such disruptions (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic).

Studies have confirmed the connection between PUS3 mutations and intellectual disability by measuring decreased tRNA pseudouridylation levels in affected individuals (Morais2021Mechanisms). These findings underscore the gene's role in brain development and the potential impact of its dysfunction on neurodevelopmental health.

## Interactions
Pseudouridine synthase 3 (PUS3) is involved in RNA modification, specifically catalyzing the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine in RNA molecules. PUS3 interacts with various proteins, suggesting it may form complexes that facilitate RNA modification. Notably, PUS3 has been shown to interact with kinases, indicating potential regulation through phosphorylation, which could influence its activity during the cell cycle (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). 

PUS3 modifies U38/39 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs, which are highly conserved pseudouridines across eukaryotes, archaea, and bacteria. This modification is crucial for proper tRNA function and mRNA decoding by the ribosome (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic; Rajan2021Pseudouridines). PUS3 also plays a role in modifying mRNA and non-coding RNA, including the steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), in conjunction with PUS1 (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic).

While specific protein interaction partners for PUS3 are not detailed, its involvement in RNA modification and potential regulation through phosphorylation suggest it participates in complex regulatory networks within the cell (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). The exact nature of these interactions and their functional implications remain areas for further research.
