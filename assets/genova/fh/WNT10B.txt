# WNT10B

## Overview
WNT10B is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 10B, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate decisions across various tissues, including bone, adipose tissue, and the immune system (Wend2011The; Perkins2023The). As a signaling molecule, Wnt family member 10B is involved in numerous physiological processes, such as promoting osteoblastogenesis and inhibiting adipogenesis, thereby maintaining bone mass and influencing adipose tissue development (Wend2011The; Bennett2005Regulation). The protein's interactions with receptors like LRP5, LRP6, and Frizzled coreceptors further underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways (Perkins2023The). Additionally, WNT10B has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, dental anomalies, obesity, and osteoporosis, highlighting its clinical relevance (Yu2016Mutations; Perkins2023The).

## Function
WNT10B is a member of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins that plays a crucial role in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate decisions in various tissues, including bone, adipose tissue, and the immune system (Wend2011The; Perkins2023The). In bone physiology, WNT10B promotes osteoblastogenesis by activating transcriptional programs that enhance osteoblast differentiation while inhibiting adipogenic transcription factors, such as C/EBPα and PPARγ (Wend2011The; Bennett2005Regulation). This activity is crucial for maintaining bone mass and strength, as evidenced by studies showing that WNT10B expression increases bone mineral density and protects against bone loss (Bennett2005Regulation; Perkins2023The).

In adipose tissue, WNT10B acts as an inhibitor of adipogenesis, preventing the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes (Wend2011The; Perkins2023The). This regulatory function is achieved through the repression of WNT10B expression via mechanisms such as DNA methylation and microRNAs, which are necessary for adipocyte formation (Perkins2023The). WNT10B's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and influencing cell fate decisions in healthy human cells (Wend2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WNT10B gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In dental development, mutations in WNT10B can lead to oligodontia, characterized by the congenital absence of six or more teeth. Specific mutations, such as c.786G>A [p.Trp262*] and c.632G>A [p.Arg211Gln], disrupt WNT10B function, affecting tooth development and leading to dental anomalies like microdontia and taurodontism (Kantaputra2018WNT10B; Yu2016Mutations).

In cancer, WNT10B overexpression is linked to various malignancies, including oral squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and osteosarcoma, where it promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (Perkins2023The). In colorectal and gastric cancers, high WNT10B expression correlates with poor survival and increased metastasis (Perkins2023The). In breast cancer, WNT10B is associated with drug resistance and tumor growth (Perkins2023The).

WNT10B is also implicated in conditions like obesity and osteoporosis due to its role in regulating adipogenesis and bone mass. Alterations in its expression can affect bone mineral density and body size (Perkins2023The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of WNT10B in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
WNT10B interacts with several proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. It activates the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway by interacting with receptors such as LRP5, LRP6, and Frizzled (FZD) coreceptors. In prostate cancer cells, WNT10B co-localizes with FZD6 and LRP6, leading to the induction of nuclear β-catenin (Perkins2023The). In osteoblasts, WNT10B upregulates fatty acid metabolism genes through LRP5 (Perkins2023The). 

WNT10B also interacts with different FZD receptors depending on the tissue type, such as FZD4 and FZD5 in acute myeloid leukemia and FZD6 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Perkins2023The). It stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting the destruction complex, which includes AXIN, APC, CK1, and GSK3α/β, leading to the activation of target genes like MYC and CCND1 (Perkins2023The). 

In the context of cancer, WNT10B is involved in interactions that influence tumor growth and metastasis. For instance, in breast cancer, it is positively correlated with NSD1, and its expression is decreased by siNSD1, reducing tumor growth (Perkins2023The). In pancreatic cancer, miR-148a targets WNT10B, suppressing its expression and reducing cancer cell invasion and migration (Peng2017MicroRNA148a).
