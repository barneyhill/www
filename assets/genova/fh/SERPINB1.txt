# SERPINB1

## Overview
SERPINB1 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 1, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis by inhibiting serine proteases such as elastase, cathepsin G, and granzyme H. These interactions are crucial for preventing excessive inflammation and tissue damage during immune responses. SERPINB1 is highly expressed in neutrophils and natural killer cells, where it plays a protective role by forming stable inhibitory complexes with target proteases. The protein's structure is characterized by a conserved serpin fold, which includes a reactive center loop essential for its inhibitory function. SERPINB1's involvement in modulating inflammatory cytokine responses and its altered expression in neurodegenerative diseases underscore its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Burgener2019Cathepsin; Zattoni2022Serpin; Wang2013Identification).

## Structure
SERPINB1 is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by a conserved tertiary structure known as the serpin fold, which includes three large beta-sheets and nine alpha-helices (Wang2013Identification). The protein lacks a signal peptide, indicating it is non-secretory (Pemberton2020Expression). The molecular structure of SERPINB1 was determined at a resolution of 2.9 Å, revealing a typical serpin architecture (Wang2013Identification). 

The reactive center loop (RCL) of SERPINB1 is flexibly exposed and plays a crucial role in its inhibitory function. It is inserted into the active site groove of target proteases, such as granzyme H, leading to inhibition (Wang2013Identification). The RCL contains key residues like Phe 343, which is critical for forming a stable covalent complex with granzyme H, resulting in the inhibition of its enzymatic activity (Wang2013Identification).

SERPINB1 can form a disulfide bridge at Cys 344, although this dimerization is not considered physiologically relevant (Wang2013Identification). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (Pemberton2020Expression).

## Function
SERPINB1 is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is highly expressed in the cytosol of neutrophils, where it inhibits neutrophil serine proteases such as elastase and cathepsin G, preventing excessive inflammation and tissue damage during immune responses (Badola2006Correlation; Burgener2019Cathepsin). By inhibiting these proteases, SERPINB1 helps maintain a healthy neutrophil reserve in the bone marrow and prevents infection-induced tissue injury (Wang2013Identification).

In natural killer (NK) cells, SERPINB1 acts as a physiological inhibitor of granzyme H (GzmH), a protease involved in inducing target cell death. It forms a stable covalent complex with GzmH, inhibiting its activity and protecting healthy cells from unwanted proteolytic damage (Wang2013Identification). This inhibition is achieved through a conformational-change suicide mechanism, where SERPINB1's reactive center loop interacts with GzmH (Wang2013Identification).

SERPINB1 also plays a role in modulating inflammatory cytokine responses by inhibiting the processing of cytokines like IL-1β, thereby controlling inflammation and preventing excessive cell death in neutrophils and monocytes (Burgener2019Cathepsin).

## Clinical Significance
SERPINB1 is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases due to its altered expression levels. It is significantly upregulated in both sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), with average fold changes of 5.2 and 4.6, respectively, compared to controls. This upregulation suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions, possibly through its regulation of cell death and interaction with amyloid processes (Zattoni2022Serpin). SERPINB1 is expressed in the human brain, particularly in microglia and macrophages, and its expression in the prefrontal cortex has been linked to amyloid burden, indicating its involvement in neurodegeneration (Zattoni2022Serpin).

Genetic variations in SERPINB1 have also been associated with amyloidosis in a sex-specific manner, further implicating its role in neurodegenerative diseases (Zattoni2022Serpin). The gene's expression alterations are associated with early stages of neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD, highlighting its potential involvement in the disease's progression (Zattoni2022Serpin). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SERPINB1 in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting it may be a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SERPINB1 is a serine protease inhibitor that interacts with various proteases to regulate immune responses and prevent tissue damage. It is identified as a physiological inhibitor of human granzyme H (GzmH), a protease involved in the immune response against infections and tumors. SERPINB1 forms a stable inhibitory complex with GzmH, blocking its enzymatic activity through a conformational-change suicide mechanism. This interaction involves the reactive center loop (RCL) of SERPINB1, particularly the Phe 343 residue, which is critical for the inhibitory effect. Mutation of this residue abolishes the inhibitory action, highlighting its importance in the interaction (Wang2013Identification).

SERPINB1 also inhibits other proteases such as elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3, playing a role in preventing infection-induced tissue injury and maintaining neutrophil reserves (Wang2013Identification). In the context of neuroinflammation, SERPINB1 regulates T helper cells by inhibiting granule proteases, thereby preventing mitochondrial damage and cell death (Hou2019SerpinB1). Additionally, SERPINB1 interacts with cathepsin G to prevent programmed necrosis in neutrophils and monocytes, reducing inflammation driven by Gasdermin D (Burgener2019Cathepsin).
