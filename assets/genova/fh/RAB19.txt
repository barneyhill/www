# RAB19

## Overview
RAB19 is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAB19 protein plays a pivotal role in primary ciliogenesis, a critical process for the formation of primary cilia, which are essential sensory organelles in vertebrate cells. As a small GTPase, RAB19 is involved in intracellular trafficking and cellular homeostasis, particularly within the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. It coordinates cortical remodeling and ciliary membrane growth, interacting with various proteins such as the RAB-GAP TBC1D4 and the HOPS complex to facilitate these processes. Dysregulation of RAB19 has been linked to several diseases, including gastric and colorectal cancers, as well as ciliopathies, due to its crucial role in maintaining proper ciliary function and cellular signaling pathways (Jewett2021RAB19; Erol2023The).

## Function
RAB19 is a small GTPase involved in primary ciliogenesis, a process essential for the formation of primary cilia, which are critical sensory organelles in vertebrate cells. RAB19 plays a key role in coordinating cortical remodeling and ciliary membrane growth, necessary for ciliogenesis. It interacts with the RAB-GAP TBC1D4 and the HOPS complex to facilitate these processes, ensuring proper formation and function of primary cilia by coordinating cellular remodeling activities (Jewett2021RAB19).

RAB19 localizes to the inner periphery of the cortical clearing and is crucial for the coordination of membrane and cytoskeletal changes required for ciliogenesis. In RAB19 knockout cells, defects in cortical actin clearing and ciliary membrane growth are observed, leading to impaired ciliogenesis (Jewett2021RAB19). RAB19 also antagonizes actin contractility, facilitating ciliogenesis by mediating cross-talk between microtubules and cortical actin networks (Jewett2021RAB19).

In healthy human cells, RAB19 is active in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. Its function is essential for maintaining proper ciliary function, and its dysfunction can lead to ciliopathy-related phenotypes (Jewett2021RAB19; Erol2023The).

## Clinical Significance
RAB19 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, RAB19 expression is upregulated, contributing to the malignancy of cancer cells. This upregulation is mediated by the long noncoding RNA LINC01320, which inhibits miR-495-5p, a microRNA that normally suppresses RAB19 expression. The resulting increase in RAB19 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Hu2021N6methyladenosine).

In colorectal cancer, RAB19 is one of the RAB GTPases significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with the metabolic CMS3 subtype of colorectal cancer and is linked to cell cycle-related pathways. The increased expression of RAB19 in colorectal cancer suggests its involvement in tumor growth and metabolism (Jiang2022The).

RAB19 is also crucial for primary ciliogenesis, a process essential for the formation of primary cilia. Alterations in RAB19 expression or function can lead to defects in ciliogenesis, potentially contributing to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in cilia structure or function (Jewett2021RAB19).

## Interactions
RAB19, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for primary ciliogenesis. It interacts with the RAB-GAP TBC1D4, which functions in cilia formation and localizes to the centrosome and satellites. Although TBC1D4 is a weak GAP for RAB19, it also acts as a GAP for RAB8, suggesting a potential link between RAB19 and RAB8 pathways in ciliary vesicle formation (Jewett2021RAB19). RAB19 also interacts with the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which is known for its role in endolysosomal trafficking. The HOPS complex acts as a membrane tether for RAB19, facilitating cortical clearing and ciliary membrane growth (Jewett2021RAB19).

In Drosophila, RAB19 shows GTP-specific binding interactions with GRIP domain proteins such as dGCC88 and dGolgin-97. These interactions are part of a broader mechanism where coiled-coil proteins guide vesicles to appropriate Golgi subdomains (Sinka2008Golgi). The interactions of RAB19 with these proteins highlight its role in vesicle sorting and Golgi apparatus organization, contributing to its function in intracellular trafficking and ciliogenesis.
