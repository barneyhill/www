# CATSPERZ

## Overview
The CATSPERZ gene encodes the catsper channel auxiliary subunit zeta, a crucial component of the CatSper ion channel complex in sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a non-transmembrane auxiliary subunit and plays a vital role in the regulation of calcium ion influx, which is essential for sperm motility and fertility in mammals. CATSPERZ is involved in the spatial organization and structural integrity of CatSper channels, forming nanodomains along the sperm tail that are critical for effective Ca2+ signaling. The presence of CATSPERZ ensures the proper alignment and connectivity of these domains, facilitating the hyperactivated motility required for successful fertilization. Disruptions in CATSPERZ function can lead to impaired sperm motility and subfertility, highlighting its significance in mammalian reproduction (Zhao20223D; Wang2020Sperm; Chung2017CatSperζ).

## Function
The CATSPERZ gene encodes a subunit of the CatSper ion channel complex, which is crucial for sperm hyperactivation and fertility in mammals. This protein is a non-transmembrane auxiliary subunit that plays a significant role in modulating the expression levels and kinetics of the CatSper channel, a sperm-specific calcium ion channel essential for Ca2+ influx in sperm cells (Zhao20223D; Wang2020Sperm). CATSPERZ is involved in the spatial organization of CatSper channels into nanodomains along the sperm tail, which are critical for effective Ca2+ signaling and sperm motility (Wang2020Sperm).

In healthy human cells, CATSPERZ helps maintain the structural integrity of these Ca2+ signaling domains, which are necessary for the hyperactivated motility of sperm. This motility is triggered by calcium influx through the CatSper channels, enabling sperm to navigate and penetrate the zona pellucida, ultimately facilitating fertilization (Chung2017CatSperζ). The presence of CATSPERZ is essential for maintaining the structural continuity of these domains, and its absence leads to fragmented signaling domains, reduced calcium entry, and impaired sperm motility, resulting in subfertility (Chung2017CatSperζ). CATSPERZ is specific to mammals, indicating its role in adaptations unique to mammalian reproduction (Chung2017CatSperζ).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CATSPERZ gene can lead to significant reproductive issues, primarily affecting male fertility. CATSPERZ is an auxiliary subunit of the CatSper ion channel complex, which is crucial for sperm motility and fertility. Disruptions in CATSPERZ can result in impaired sperm function, leading to male subfertility or infertility. Studies have shown that CatSperz-null spermatozoa exhibit reduced CatSper channel activity and disrupted structural continuity of Ca2+ signaling domains, which are essential for normal sperm motility and the ability to navigate the female reproductive tract (Chung2017CatSperζ).

The absence of CATSPERZ results in fragmented CatSper channel patterns along the sperm tail, causing increased rigidity and reduced hyperactivated motility. This rigidity affects the sperm's ability to penetrate the egg, leading to reduced fertilization capacity (Chung2017CatSperζ). Although CATSPERZ-null sperm can bind to the zona pellucida after cumulus removal, they struggle to penetrate cumulus-intact oocytes, indicating a significant impact on fertilization potential (Chung2017CatSperζ). These findings underscore the critical role of CATSPERZ in maintaining the structural integrity of sperm Ca2+ signaling domains necessary for effective sperm function and fertility (Chung2017CatSperζ).

## Interactions
CATSPERZ, a component of the CatSper channel complex, plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sperm flagellar Ca2+ signaling domains. It forms a subcomplex with EFCAB9, which is essential for the proper alignment and connectivity of CatSper nanodomains. The absence of the EFCAB9-CATSPERζ complex leads to disruptions in the zigzag arrangement of CatSper channels, resulting in fragmented and misaligned rows that impair sperm motility (Zhao20223D).

CATSPERZ interacts with other CatSper subunits, including CATSPER1-4, and auxiliary proteins such as CATSPERβ and CATSPERγ. These interactions are crucial for the formation of the CatSper channel complex, which is necessary for calcium ion influx and sperm hyperactivation (Zhao20223D). The EFCAB9-CATSPERζ subcomplex also regulates pH-dependent activation and Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, highlighting its role in modulating the channel's functional properties (Zhao20223D).

The absence of CATSPERZ results in reduced expression levels of other CatSper subunits and fragmented CatSper domains, indicating its importance in maintaining the structural continuity of the complex (Chung2017CatSperζ).
