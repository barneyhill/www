# TRERF1

## Overview
TRERF1, or transcriptional regulating factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling. The protein encoded by TRERF1 is characterized by the presence of an ELM2-SANT domain, which is commonly found in co-repressor proteins and plays a critical role in the assembly of histone deacetylase complexes, such as the MiDAC complex (Itoh2015Structural). This domain facilitates interactions with various proteins, including DNTTIP1, MIDEAS, and ZNF541, which are integral to transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics. TRERF1 is also implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing in response to TNF-α, linking it to metabolic pathways and potential metabolic syndromes (Louis2020TNFalpha). The gene has been associated with several diseases, including breast and colorectal cancers, where it may influence disease progression and treatment resistance (Lee2013Systematic; van2008Functional). Additionally, TRERF1 has been studied in the context of major depressive disorder and electroconvulsive therapy, highlighting its potential role in psychiatric conditions (Moschny2020Novel).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TRERF1 (transcriptional regulating factor 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In breast cancer, TRERF1 is associated with estrogen independence and resistance to anti-estrogen treatments like tamoxifen. The gene was identified as a contributor to estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer cells, suggesting its role in therapy resistance (van2008Functional).

In colorectal cancer, TRERF1 has been identified as a gene of interest across different clinical parameters, indicating its potential significance in cancer progression (Lee2013Systematic). Although specific mutations or expression changes were not detailed, its repeated identification suggests a role in disease advancement.

TRERF1 has also been studied in the context of major depressive disorder and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Changes in DNA methylation of TRERF1 were observed during ECT treatment, although its direct link to treatment response remains unclear (Moschny2020Novel).

In lung cancer research, TRERF1 was excluded from significant findings due to likely false-positive results, indicating that its mutations may not have clinical significance in this context (Campbell2016Distinct).

## Interactions
TRERF1, also known as transcriptional regulating factor 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation. It contains an ELM2-SANT domain, which is typically found in co-repressor proteins and acts as a scaffold for class I histone deacetylase complexes. This domain facilitates interactions with proteins such as DNTTIP1, MIDEAS, and ZNF541, which are part of the MiDAC complex, a novel histone deacetylase complex associated with cyclin A and upregulated during mitosis (Itoh2015Structural).

TRERF1's interaction with DNTTIP1 suggests a potential regulatory role in transcription, although specific interactions within the MiDAC complex are not detailed. The ELM2-SANT domain is crucial for mediating interactions with HDAC1 and HDAC2, indicating TRERF1's involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Itoh2015Structural).

Additionally, TRERF1 has been implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing in response to TNF-α, affecting genes associated with metabolic syndromes. This suggests that TRERF1 participates in a network of genes whose splicing is influenced by TNF-α, potentially impacting metabolic pathways (Louis2020TNFalpha).
