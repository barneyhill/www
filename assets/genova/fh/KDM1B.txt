# KDM1B

## Overview
KDM1B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 1B, also known as LSD2, which is a member of the histone demethylase family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by demethylating specific lysine residues on histone proteins, particularly targeting H3K4me1/2. As a histone demethylase, KDM1B is involved in chromatin modification, influencing transcriptional regulation and gene silencing. The protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, including a zinc-finger domain, a SWIRM domain, and an amine oxidase domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with cofactors such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (Zhang2012Structurefunction). KDM1B's involvement in various protein interactions and its role in transcription elongation underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Fang2010Human).

## Structure
The KDM1B protein, also known as LSD2, is a histone demethylase with a complex molecular structure comprising several distinct domains. It features a zinc-finger domain, a SWIRM domain, and an amine oxidase domain (AOD), forming a boot-shaped structure (Zhang2012Structurefunction). The zinc-finger domain includes a novel C4H2C2-type zinc finger and a CW-type zinc finger, which are crucial for its demethylase activity and the binding of the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (Zhang2012Structurefunction). The SWIRM domain is an α-helical structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions and is essential for the enzymatic activity of KDM1B (Zhang2012Structurefunction).

KDM1B adopts a compact rod shape and lacks the 'tower domain' found in its paralogue LSD1, highlighting its unique structural features (Fang2013LSD2KDM1B). The interaction between the zinc-finger and SWIRM domains is critical for maintaining the active conformation necessary for FAD binding and enzymatic function (Zhang2012Structurefunction). The protein's structure allows it to accommodate several residues of the histone H3 tail, specifically targeting H3K4me1/2 for demethylation (Zhang2012Structurefunction). These structural characteristics underscore KDM1B's role in chromatin modification and its potential as a target for specific inhibitors (Zhang2012Structurefunction).

## Clinical Significance
KDM1B, also known as LSD2, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in gene transcription regulation through histone demethylation. In breast cancer, KDM1B is highly expressed, particularly in invasive tumors, and its knockdown leads to reduced colony formation and increased sensitivity to DNMT inhibitors, suggesting a survival-promoting role. This indicates that targeting KDM1B could enhance the efficacy of breast cancer treatments, especially when combined with DNMT inhibitors (Katz2014Inhibition).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), KDM1B is upregulated and acts as an oncogene by repressing p53 expression through H3K4me2 demethylation, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This upregulation is associated with aggressive tumor biology and poor prognosis, highlighting KDM1B as a potential molecular target for CRC therapy (Cai2020Lysinespecific).

KDM1B's expression levels are also lower in certain leukemias, seminomas, and ER-negative breast cancers, suggesting its function in transcription regulation could be linked to tumorigenesis. This makes KDM1B a potential target for anticancer drug development (Fang2010Human). The gene's location at chromosome 6p22, a region with frequent chromosomal alterations in various cancers, further underscores its clinical significance (Fang2010Human).

## Interactions
KDM1B, also known as LSD2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in gene transcription regulation. KDM1B forms active complexes with euchromatic histone methyltransferases such as G9a and NSD3, as well as factors involved in transcription elongation, including the P-TEFb complex, which contains cyclin T1 and CDK9. These interactions facilitate the modulation of histone methylation within gene bodies, particularly affecting H3K4 and H3K9 methylation dynamics (Fang2010Human).

KDM1B is associated with elongating RNA polymerase II and interacts with phosphorylated RNA Pol II, linking it to active transcription processes. The presence of Ser2-phosphorylated RNA polymerase in the KDM1B complex suggests a functional connection between KDM1B and transcription elongation (Fang2010Human).

KDM1B also interacts with NPAC/GLYR1, which enhances its enzymatic activity by stabilizing the interaction between KDM1B and the histone H3 peptide. This interaction is crucial for substrate recognition and demethylation activity, highlighting the importance of specific residues in forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Chen2013Structural).
