# DAGLA

## Overview
The DAGLA gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha, which is a crucial component in lipid signaling pathways. This enzyme is categorized as a lipase and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) from diacylglycerol (DAG) precursors. Diacylglycerol lipase alpha is characterized by a complex structure that includes a four transmembrane domain and a catalytic domain with an α/β hydrolase fold, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins (Reisenberg2012The). The protein plays a significant role in synaptic signaling and plasticity, influencing processes such as axonal growth, neurogenesis, and neurotransmitter release (Reisenberg2012The). Additionally, DAGLA is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, as well as in cancer progression, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Smith2017Rare; Yan2023Diacylglycerol).

## Structure
Diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA) is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a four transmembrane (4TM) domain, which consists of a short cytoplasmic N-terminal sequence and four helices. This domain is thought to facilitate enzyme packing at the membrane or serve as docking sites for other proteins (Reisenberg2012The). The catalytic domain of DAGLA is defined by an α/β hydrolase fold and contains a conserved catalytic triad composed of serine, aspartic acid, and histidine within a hydrophobic active site (Reisenberg2012The).

A notable feature of DAGLA is its regulatory loop, which is larger than typical lipase lid/cap regions and may control substrate access to the catalytic site. This loop includes a conserved poly-proline 'signature motif,' suggesting a potential binding function (Reisenberg2012The). The carboxyl-terminal tail of DAGLA is heavily phosphorylated, indicating additional regulatory roles (Reisenberg2012The). Phosphorylation, particularly at serine 738, is crucial for DAGLA's interaction with ankyrin-G, affecting dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity (Yoon2021cAMP). DAGLA exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization.

## Function
Diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) from diacylglycerol (DAG) precursors. This process primarily occurs in the postsynaptic compartments of synapses, where DAGLA is highly active. The 2-AG produced by DAGLA acts as a significant ligand for cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, influencing synaptic signaling and plasticity by inhibiting neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals (Schüle2020Diacylglycerol; Reisenberg2012The).

DAGLA is involved in various cellular processes, including axonal growth and guidance during brain development, and it shifts its expression to dendritic spines in the adult brain to facilitate synaptic plasticity. This plasticity is essential for learning, memory, and mood regulation (Reisenberg2012The). In the adult brain, DAGLA is also crucial for neurogenesis, particularly in the subventricular zone and hippocampus, where it supports the proliferation and migration of neural stem cells (Reisenberg2012The).

Beyond its role in endocannabinoid signaling, DAGLA contributes to maintaining arachidonic acid levels, which are important for generating inflammatory prostaglandins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Reisenberg2012The). DAGLA's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its enzymatic function and interaction with other proteins (Reisenberg2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DAGLA gene have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric conditions. Rare genetic variants in DAGLA are associated with neurological phenotypes, including seizures, neurodevelopmental disorders, and brain abnormalities. Specific variants such as p.His810Gln and p.Arg815His have been linked to infantile spasms, focal seizures, and developmental disorders (Smith2017Rare). These findings underscore the critical role of DAGLA in neurological function and development.

DAGLA has also been implicated in cerebellar ataxia, where it is identified as an autoantibody target. Patients with severe cerebellar ataxia have shown the presence of anti-DAGLA autoantibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting a pathogenic role that may involve inhibition or activation of DAGLA function, complement-mediated toxicity, or T-cell mediated processes (Miske2024Identification).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DAGLA expression is upregulated and associated with tumor progression and resistance to the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib. The DAGLA/2-AG axis promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, contributing to poor prognosis in HCC patients (Yan2023Diacylglycerol). These findings highlight DAGLA as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA) interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic signaling and dendritic spine morphology. One notable interaction is with ankyrin-G, a multifunctional scaffold protein. This interaction is crucial for dendritic spine morphogenesis and is enhanced by cAMP signaling-mediated phosphorylation of DAGLA at serine 738. This phosphorylation increases the interaction with ankyrin-G, affecting dendritic spine size and density (Yoon2021cAMP). The interaction between DAGLA and ankyrin-G is also associated with the regulation of surface diffusion during spine enlargement in excitatory neurons (Yoon2021cAMP).

DAGLA also interacts with other postsynaptic density-related proteins, including Shank3, Anks1b, Homer1, and Camk2α, which are involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release (Yoon2021cAMP). These interactions suggest that DAGLA plays a role in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms affecting spine morphology and density.

In addition to its interactions with ankyrin-G, DAGLA is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine 798, which enhances its activity in synthesizing 2-arachidonoylglycerol, a key endocannabinoid involved in synaptic signaling (Shonesy2020Cyclic).
