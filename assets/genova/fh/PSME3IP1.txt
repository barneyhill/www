# PSME3IP1

## Overview
PSME3IP1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as proteasome activator subunit 3 interacting protein 1. This protein is involved in the regulation of proteasome activity, a critical process for protein degradation and turnover within cells. As a transmembrane protein, PSME3IP1 interacts with the proteasome activator subunit 3 (PSME3), playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stress responses. The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring protein quality control. Its stable presence in the nucleus across various cell lines suggests a significant role in nuclear proteasome activity regulation (Zhang2024Prediction; VeraguasDávila2024Proteomic).

## Function
PSME3IP1, or proteasome activator subunit 3 interacting protein 1, plays a significant role in the regulation of proteasome activity, which is essential for protein degradation and turnover within cells. This protein interacts with the proteasome activator subunit 3 (PSME3), influencing critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stress responses. PSME3IP1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring protein quality control (Zhang2024Prediction).

In the context of protein subcellular localization, PSME3IP1 is identified as one of the least variable proteins across different cell lines, with a primary localization inside the nucleus. This consistent localization suggests a stable role in nuclear processes, potentially involving the regulation of nuclear proteasome activity (Zhang2024Prediction). The protein's function as a transmembrane protein has been noted in studies involving domestic cat blastocysts, although its specific role in healthy human cells remains less defined (VeraguasDávila2024Proteomic). Overall, PSME3IP1's involvement in proteasome regulation underscores its importance in cellular function and organismal health.
