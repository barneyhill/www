# CXCL11

## Overview
CXCL11 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11, a member of the chemokine family involved in immune cell signaling and migration. The protein, also known as Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), is a chemokine that primarily interacts with the CXCR3 receptor, playing a crucial role in the recruitment and activation of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. CXCL11 is characterized by its canonical chemokine structure, which includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and an α-helix, and is noted for its high affinity for the CXCR3 receptor due to specific structural features. The gene's expression is regulated by various factors and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including immune responses, cancer progression, and autoimmune diseases. CXCL11's interactions with receptors and its modulation by proteolytic enzymes underscore its significance in both normal immune function and disease states (Cox2008Matrix; Korniejewska2011Expression; Booth2004NMR).

## Structure
The CXCL11 protein, also known as ITAC, exhibits a canonical chemokine fold characterized by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet packed against an α-helix. This structure is stabilized by a long N-terminal loop with two disulfide bonds and a 3_10 helix (Booth2004NMR). The N-terminal region, consisting of the first eight residues, is unassigned in the NMR structure and is presumed to be unstructured unless bound to a receptor (Booth2004NMR). 

CXCL11 is primarily monomeric at physiological concentrations, with a molecular weight of approximately 11 kDa, and does not form dimers like some other chemokines due to a β-bulge in β-strand 1 that distorts the dimerization interface (Booth2004NMR). The N-loop region, which includes residues 12-17, is hydrophobic and contributes significantly to the protein's high affinity for the CXCR3 receptor (Booth2004NMR). 

The protein's structure shows conformational flexibility, particularly in the loops between β-strands and the α-helix, which may relate to its binding affinity and interaction with CXCR3 (Booth2004NMR). The NMR analysis revealed multiple conformations under different pH and temperature conditions, indicating conformational heterogeneity (Booth2004NMR).

## Function
CXCL11, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11, is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune cell migration, particularly T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It functions primarily by binding to the CXCR3 receptor, which is expressed on Th1 lymphocytes, CD8+ cells, and natural killer cells, among others (Korniejewska2011Expression). CXCL11 is considered a dominant agonist for CXCR3 due to its higher potency and efficacy compared to other ligands like CXCL9 and CXCL10 (Korniejewska2011Expression).

In healthy human cells, CXCL11 plays a crucial role in forming chemokine gradients through its interaction with glycosaminoglycans, which is essential for directing leukocyte migration during immune responses (Cox2008Matrix). This interaction is vital for the recruitment of Th1 cells to sites of inflammation, where it stimulates calcium flux and receptor desensitization, leading to cellular responses such as integrin activation and actin reorganization (Korniejewska2011Expression).

CXCL11 also influences T cell polarization by promoting phosphorylation of specific transcription factors, leading to a regulatory phenotype (Metzemaekers2018Overview). It is involved in the internalization and signaling of CXCR3, affecting the availability of the receptor for other ligands (Metzemaekers2018Overview). The chemokine's activity is modulated by matrix metalloproteinases, which can cleave CXCL11, altering its chemoattractant activity and glycosaminoglycan binding properties (Cox2008Matrix).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL11 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In multiple myeloma, high CXCL11 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to increased cell proliferation and immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. It also influences macrophage polarization, promoting tumor progression (Wang2022Integrative). In breast cancer, CXCL11 secreted by senescent endothelial cells enhances the aggressiveness of cancer cells by promoting their migration and invasion through the ERK signaling pathway. This is associated with decreased survival probability in patients (Hwang2020Endothelial).

In colon cancer, high CXCL11 expression correlates with improved prognosis due to its association with antitumor immunity, including increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells (Cao2021CXCL11). Conversely, in pancreatic cancer, CXCL11 is upregulated and linked to more aggressive cancer characteristics, such as higher staging and nerve invasion. It is a direct target of miR-548t-5p, and its expression is negatively correlated with miR-548t-5p levels, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Ge2020The).

CXCL11 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases by modulating immune responses. It induces regulatory T cells that suppress inflammation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions like autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Zohar2017CXCL11dependent).

## Interactions
CXCL11, also known as Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), primarily interacts with the CXCR3 receptor, where it exhibits the highest affinity compared to other chemokines like CXCL9 and CXCL10. The N-terminal and N-loop regions of CXCL11 are crucial for its strong binding affinity to CXCR3, with the N-loop interacting with the N-terminal region of CXCR3 and loops 1, 2, and 3 of the receptor (Trotta2009Modelling). Deletion of the first three residues of CXCL11 transforms it into a potent antagonist, highlighting the importance of these residues in receptor activation (Trotta2009Modelling; Booth2004NMR).

CXCL11 also interacts with the CXCR7 receptor, although with less efficiency compared to CXCR3. Intact CXCL11 shows significant chemotactic activity and competes effectively for binding to both CXCR3 and CXCR7, while truncated forms exhibit reduced binding affinity and chemotactic activity (Proost2007Proteolytic). The interaction with CXCR7 does not induce calcium signaling or phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or Akt, indicating a different signaling mechanism compared to CXCR3 (Proost2007Proteolytic).

The structural interactions of CXCL11 with CXCR3 and CXCR7 involve hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, with the CXCR7/CXCL11 complex being more stable due to differences in loop lengths and residue properties (Costantini2013Common).
