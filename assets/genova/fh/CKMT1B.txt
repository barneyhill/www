# CKMT1B

## Overview
The CKMT1B gene encodes the mitochondrial creatine kinase 1B, a key enzyme in cellular energy metabolism. This protein belongs to the kinase family and is primarily involved in the reversible transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine, which serves as an energy reservoir in cells. CKMT1B is predominantly active in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it plays a critical role in the creatine kinase/phosphocreatine (CK/PCr) shuttle, facilitating energy transfer between mitochondria and the cytosol. This function is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis in tissues with high energy demands, such as muscles and the brain (Shi2021CKMT1B; Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The protein's interactions with mitochondrial membranes and other proteins underscore its importance in cellular energy regulation and mechanical stability (Bonilla2021Metabolic). Additionally, CKMT1B has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including sensorineural deafness, male infertility, and cancer, highlighting its multifaceted role in human health and disease (Shi2021CKMT1B; Zhang2007Sensorineural).

## Structure
The CKMT1B gene encodes a mitochondrial creatine kinase involved in energy metabolism. The primary structure of CKMT1B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is identical to that encoded by the CKMT1A gene, with the two genes distinguished by synonymous point mutations (datler2013apoptosis). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the monomeric structure featuring a small all-α N-terminal domain and a larger α + β C-terminal domain (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The C-terminal domain contains an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by seven α-helices, contributing to the enzyme's active site (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

CKMT1B forms dimers that can associate into octamers, which are the predominant quaternary structure in native cell lysates (datler2013apoptosis). These octamers are crucial for the protein's function in mitochondrial energy metabolism and are stabilized by interactions with cardiolipin and other phospholipids (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). Post-translational modifications such as lysine acetylation and phosphorylation have been noted, although their functional consequences are not fully understood (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The protein's interaction with cardiolipin-rich membranes is facilitated by positively charged residues in the C-terminal stretch, which acts as a flexible docking domain (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

## Function
The CKMT1B gene encodes a mitochondrial creatine kinase enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme is involved in the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine (PCr), which acts as an energy reservoir. This process is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in tissues with high energy demands, such as muscles and the brain (Shi2021CKMT1B; Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

CKMT1B is active in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates energy transfer between mitochondria and the cytosol. It forms part of proteolipid complexes that interact with mitochondrial membranes, particularly cardiolipin, to stabilize mitochondrial structures and enhance energy transfer efficiency (Wallimann2011The; Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the CK/PCr shuttle, a system that buffers and transfers energy within cells, supporting cellular functions such as muscle contraction and brain activity (Bonilla2021Metabolic).

CKMT1B also plays a role in cellular mechanics and energy regulation by interacting with proteins involved in ATP production and cytoskeletal functions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular energy balance and mechanical stability (Bonilla2021Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions involving the CKMT1B gene have been associated with sensorineural deafness and male infertility as part of a contiguous gene deletion syndrome. In particular, a genomic deletion greater than 100 kb, which includes CKMT1B, has been linked to autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness and asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by malformed sperm with poor motility, leading to male infertility (Zhang2007Sensorineural).

Alterations in CKMT1B expression levels have been implicated in various cancers. In lower-grade glioma (LGG), low expression of CKMT1B is associated with poor prognosis and more advanced tumor grades. CKMT1B expression affects immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, influencing overall survival in LGG patients (Shi2021CKMT1B). In gastric cancer, CKMT1B, also known as ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK), promotes cancer progression through the JNK-MAPK/JUN signaling pathway, affecting glycolysis and tumor cell invasion (Mi2022Ubiquitous). These findings suggest that CKMT1B plays a complex role in tumorigenesis, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the cancer type (Shi2021CKMT1B).

## Interactions
The CKMT1B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism by transferring high-energy phosphate from mitochondria to cytosolic creatine. In its octameric state, CKMT1B interacts with the porin of the mitochondrial membrane pore, which reduces the probability of pore opening. This interaction interferes with the induction of apoptosis that is dependent on cytochrome c release, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression (Cimino2008Identification).

CKMT1B is part of the mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) family, which forms complexes with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane. These interactions are characterized by high-affinity electrostatic interactions between mtCK and VDAC, facilitated by the negative charges on VDAC's loops and the positive charges on mtCK residues (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). Although direct interaction between mtCK and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) has not been detected, they are found in the same complexes, likely mediated by cardiolipin, suggesting co-localization in cardiolipin-rich membrane patches (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). These interactions are crucial for the preferential use of mitochondrially generated ATP to drive the mtCK equilibrium reaction towards phosphocreatine generation (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).
