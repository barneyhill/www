# DEFB130B

## Overview
The DEFB130B gene encodes the protein defensin beta 130B, which is a member of the β-defensin family, known for their role in the innate immune response. Defensin beta 130B is a small, cationic, and amphipathic peptide that exhibits antimicrobial properties, contributing to the host defense against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Pazgier2006Human). The protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a 'defensin-like' topological fold with a core of β-strands and an α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human). Unlike some other β-defensins, DEFB130B has a distinctive acidic region on its surface, which may influence its interaction with microbial membranes (Terkawi2017Involvement). This protein's selective antimicrobial action, without hemolytic activity at high concentrations, underscores its potential therapeutic applications in combating infections (Terkawi2017Involvement).

## Structure
The DEFB130B protein, encoded by the DEFB130B gene, is a β-defensin characterized by its antimicrobial properties. It is a 7-kDa cationic and amphipathic peptide with a net charge of +9, rich in lysine and arginine residues, and contains six invariant cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds, a common feature among β-defensins (Terkawi2017Involvement). These disulfide bonds contribute to the stability of its structure, which includes both α-helix and β-sheet conformations (Terkawi2017Involvement). 

The tertiary structure of DEFB130B is described as a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with a core consisting of three β-strands and an α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human). This structure is typical of β-defensins, which are known for their conserved β-sheet-rich, cationic, and amphipathic nature (Pazgier2006Human). 

DEFB130B also features a unique acidic region on its surface, distinguishing it from other β-defensins (Terkawi2017Involvement). The protein does not exhibit hemolytic activity at concentrations up to 200 μM, indicating its selective antimicrobial action (Terkawi2017Involvement). The quaternary structure details, such as oligomerization, are not explicitly provided for DEFB130B.
