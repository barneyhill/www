# CRELD1

## Overview
CRELD1 is a gene that encodes the protein cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 1, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in cardiac and muscular development. The CRELD1 protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein with multiple EGF-like domains, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Mass2014Murine; Rupp2002Identification). It plays a pivotal role in the maturation and assembly of ionotropic acetylcholine receptors in muscle cells and is involved in cardiac development through its interaction with the calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling pathway (D’Alessandro2018CRELD1; Mass2014Murine). Mutations in the CRELD1 gene have been linked to congenital heart defects, such as atrioventricular septal defects, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiovascular anomalies (Asim2018CRELD1; Maslen2006CRELD1). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as α1a-adrenoceptor and Reticulon3, further underscore its diverse functional roles in cellular physiology (Xiang2009RTN3; Nishimune2010Identification).

## Structure
The CRELD1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of CRELD1 features a 420-amino-acid sequence with a cleavable secretion signal at the N-terminus (amino acids 1-29) and two type III transmembrane domains at the C-terminus (residues 363-382 and 387-406) (Mass2014Murine; Rupp2002Identification). The protein contains multiple EGF-like domains, some of which are calcium-binding, and a unique WE domain rich in glutamic acid and tryptophan residues (Mass2014Murine; Rupp2002Identification).

The secondary structure is suggested to include beta-sheet formations typical of EGF-like domains, although specific details are not provided (Rupp2002Identification). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature due to the cysteine-rich nature of EGF-like domains (Robinson2003Missense). CRELD1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation at two consensus sites and phosphorylation at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Rupp2002Identification).

Alternative splicing of CRELD1 results in different isoforms, one of which lacks the transmembrane domains and includes a new 73-amino-acid sequence at the C-terminus, altering its cellular localization and function (Rupp2002Identification).

## Function
The CRELD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the maturation and assembly of ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in muscle cells. It acts as a maturational enhancer in the endoplasmic reticulum, stabilizing unassembled AChR subunits and promoting their assembly, which is critical for muscle function (D’Alessandro2018CRELD1). CRELD1 is also involved in cardiac development through its role in the calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling pathway. It facilitates the translocation of NFATc1 to the nucleus, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which is essential for the formation and remodeling of endocardial cushions, the precursors of heart valves (Mass2014Murine). The protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and cell membrane, influencing cellular communication and structural integrity (Rupp2002Identification). CRELD1's interaction with calcineurin is crucial for the VEGF-dependent proliferation of endocardial cells by promoting the expression of NFATc1 target genes, which is vital for proper heart development (Mass2014Murine). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRELD1 gene are significantly associated with atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), a type of congenital heart defect. These mutations can occur in both syndromic and non-syndromic cases, with a notable prevalence in individuals with Down syndrome (DS) (Asim2018CRELD1; Maslen2006CRELD1). In particular, missense mutations such as R329C and E414K have been identified in patients with AVSD, with some mutations being inherited and others occurring de novo (Robinson2003Missense; Maslen2006CRELD1). These mutations often exhibit incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals carrying the mutation will develop the defect (Robinson2003Missense; Maslen2006CRELD1).

CRELD1 mutations are also implicated in the pathogenesis of AVSD through interactions with other genetic factors, such as the VEGFA gene. Studies suggest that the presence of both CRELD1 mutations and specific VEGFA alleles can increase the risk of AVSD, indicating a potential allelic interaction (Redig2014Allelic). Additionally, CRELD1 variants have been associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) in Turner syndrome, suggesting a broader role in congenital heart disease (Pinnaro2023CRELD1). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in cardiac development and its contribution to congenital heart anomalies.

## Interactions
CRELD1 is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with the α1a-adrenoceptor (α1a-AR), modulating its expression and phenotype. This interaction involves the C-terminal region of CRELD1, which is essential for binding to α1a-AR, and affects the expression of the α1L-adrenoceptor phenotype (Nishimune2010Identification).

CRELD1 also interacts with Reticulon3 (RTN3), a protein involved in apoptosis. This interaction can modulate RTN3's apoptotic activity by altering its subcellular localization, recruiting RTN3 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, and reducing its apoptotic effects (Xiang2009RTN3).

In cardiac development, CRELD1 interacts with calcineurin, a phosphatase that regulates NFATc1 signaling. CRELD1 forms a complex with calcineurin B, promoting the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATc1, which is crucial for its transcriptional activity. This interaction is vital for the VEGF-dependent proliferation of endocardial cells and is implicated in heart development (Mass2014Murine).
