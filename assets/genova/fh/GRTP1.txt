# GRTP1

## Overview
GRTP1, or growth hormone regulated TBC protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer biology. The protein encoded by GRTP1 is categorized as a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain-containing protein, which is typically involved in the regulation of Rab GTPases, a family of proteins that play critical roles in intracellular trafficking. Although the precise biological functions of GRTP1 are not fully elucidated, its expression and interactions suggest a role in modulating immune responses and cell cycle regulation, particularly in the context of cancer. The gene has been studied in relation to its expression patterns and potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers, including gastric cancer, glioma, and breast cancer, highlighting its significance in oncological research (Melchor2009Comprehensive; Li2022Relationship; Mitchell2019Common).

## Clinical Significance
GRTP1 has been implicated in various cancers, although its precise role and clinical significance remain under investigation. In gastric cancer, GRTP1 is identified as a hub gene with low expression levels associated with poor prognosis. It shows a significant negative correlation with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a potential role in modulating immune responses in gastric cancer (Li2022Relationship). 

In glioma, GRTP1 is associated with the polo kinase family, particularly Plk1, which is involved in cell cycle regulation. This interaction suggests that GRTP1 could be a target for anti-glioma therapies, as Plk1 inhibition affects mitosis and promotes apoptosis in glioma cells (Mitchell2019Common).

In breast cancer, GRTP1 is located in the 13q34 chromosomal region, which is subject to genomic amplification. Although GRTP1 itself does not show significant overexpression in breast tumors with this amplification, it is part of a region that includes other genes implicated in tumorigenesis (Melchor2009Comprehensive). 

Overall, while GRTP1 is associated with several cancer types, its direct involvement and the impact of its expression changes require further research to fully understand its clinical significance.
