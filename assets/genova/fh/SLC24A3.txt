# SLC24A3

## Overview
SLC24A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 24 member 3, also known as the potassium-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger type 3 (NCKX3). This protein is a transmembrane ion exchanger that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis by facilitating the exchange of sodium and calcium ions in a potassium-dependent manner. NCKX3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, with additional expression in the aorta, uterus, intestine, and skeletal muscle, albeit at lower levels in other tissues (Parolo2017Ancestors’). The gene's function is integral to various physiological processes, including neuronal signaling and muscle contraction, and it has been implicated in several health conditions such as hypertension and preeclampsia, underscoring its significance in cardiovascular health and metabolic responses (Parolo2017Ancestors’; Maaliki2022Pathophysiology).

## Function
The SLC24A3 gene encodes the potassium-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger type 3 protein (NCKX3), which is primarily involved in the transport of ions across cellular membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis by facilitating the exchange of sodium and calcium ions in a potassium-dependent manner. NCKX3 is most abundantly expressed in the brain, but it is also present in the aorta, uterus, intestine, and skeletal muscle, with lower expression levels in other tissues (Parolo2017Ancestors’).

In healthy human cells, SLC24A3 is involved in several biological processes, including the negative regulation of endopeptidase activity and calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Its molecular functions include signal transducer activity, serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, and calcium ion binding (Wang2020The). The protein's activity is crucial for processes such as neuronal signaling and muscle contraction, contributing to the overall physiological function of these tissues.

The gene's expression and function have been linked to various health conditions, including salt-sensitive vasoconstriction, hypertension, and preeclampsia, highlighting its importance in cardiovascular health and metabolic responses to dietary minerals (Parolo2017Ancestors’).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC24A3 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. Variants in SLC24A3 are associated with salt-sensitive hypertension (HTN), a condition characterized by increased blood pressure in response to salt intake. Polymorphisms in this gene can lead to altered vascular tone by increasing cytoplasmic calcium concentration, contributing significantly to the development of salt-sensitive HTN (Maaliki2022Pathophysiology). 

SLC24A3 is also linked to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a nonatherosclerotic arteriopathy. Genetic studies have identified SLC24A3 as a locus associated with FMD, with variants located in arterial-specific regulatory elements. These variants are involved in mechanisms related to the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium homeostasis, which are crucial for vascular contraction (Georges2021Genetic).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), SLC24A3 has been identified as a downregulated gene, suggesting its potential involvement in AD pathology. The downregulation of SLC24A3 in AD may affect calcium homeostasis, which is a critical factor in the disease's progression (Feng2014Analysis). 

Additionally, SLC24A3 is upregulated in metastatic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL), indicating a role in tumor metastasis through its involvement in various signaling pathways (Zhang2022Joint).

## Interactions
SLC24A3, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in various interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associated with acute aortic dissection (AD), where it interacts with other proteins such as ITM2C. This network, constructed using the STRING database, includes 32 nodes and 166 edges, highlighting the significance of SLC24A3 in the context of AD (Wang2020The).

In the realm of gene regulation, SLC24A3 is a target of miR-107-5p, a microRNA that is highly expressed in AD tissues. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of miR-107-5p in the expression of SLC24A3, potentially affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis in vascular tissues (Wang2020The).

Additionally, SLC24A3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through interactions with bovine miRNAs, such as bta-miR-11975 and bta-miR-11976. These miRNAs have binding sites in the coding sequences of SLC24A3 mRNA, indicating potential regulatory effects on its expression and function (Myrzabekova2022Identification). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory networks in which SLC24A3 participates, influencing its role in ion transport and cellular homeostasis.
