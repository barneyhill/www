# CDCP2

## Overview
CDCP2 is a gene located on chromosome 1p32.3 that encodes the CUB domain containing protein 2, which is characterized by the presence of a cystathione Beta-synthase (CBS) domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The CBS domain is known for its role in binding small molecules and is implicated in several hereditary diseases when mutated. The protein encoded by CDCP2 is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its involvement in cellular signaling pathways suggests a regulatory function. Research has highlighted its potential clinical significance, particularly in neurological conditions such as epilepsy and Parkinson's Disease, although its role in the latter remains under investigation (Haugarvoll2008Finemapping; Gallek2016Cortical).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The CDCP2 gene, located on chromosome 1p32.3, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in encoding a protein with a cystathione Beta-synthase (CBS) domain. Mutations in the CBS domain are associated with several hereditary diseases, including homocystinuria, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (Gallek2016Cortical).

In the context of epilepsy, CDCP2 has shown prognostic value for predicting seizure-free outcomes following anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy (ATL/AH) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The gene was significantly down-regulated in patients who became seizure-free post-surgery, suggesting its potential role in surgical outcome prediction (Gallek2016Cortical).

The involvement of CDCP2 in Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains controversial. While some studies have identified CDCP2 within the PARK10 locus as a candidate for late-onset PD susceptibility, others have found no significant association (Haugarvoll2008Finemapping; Beecham2015PARK10). This highlights the need for further research to clarify its role in PD.
