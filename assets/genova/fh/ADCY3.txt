# ADCY3

## Overview
ADCY3, or adenylate cyclase 3, is a gene that encodes a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP. This enzyme, categorized as a transmembrane protein, plays a pivotal role in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly in olfactory signal transduction and metabolic regulation. The protein is characterized by a pseudo-symmetric structure with two transmembrane domains and a catalytic core, and it is sensitive to Ca2+-calmodulin, which influences its activity. ADCY3 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain and adipose tissue, and is implicated in processes such as neurodevelopment, energy balance, and insulin release. Genetic variations in ADCY3 have been associated with obesity and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Wu2016Adenylate; Toumba2021Molecular; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

## Structure
ADCY3, or adenylate cyclase 3, is a membrane-bound enzyme characterized by a pseudo-symmetric structure comprising two transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices, and two cytoplasmic domains that form the catalytic core (Devasani2022Expression; Toumba2021Molecular). The protein's active site is located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and it is involved in the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP upon G-protein signaling (Toumba2021Molecular). 

A notable structural feature of ADCY3 is the α-helical region embedded in the cellular membrane, specifically between amino acids 105-125, which includes the site of a significant mutation, p.Leu117Met. This mutation affects the protein's interaction with the lipid bilayer, potentially altering its stability and function (Toumba2021Molecular). 

ADCY3 is sensitive to Ca2+-calmodulin and is involved in olfactory signal transduction, with its expression observed in various tissues, including the brain and adipocyte tissues (Toumba2021Molecular; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity (Devasani2022Expression). ADCY3 can form homodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Devasani2022Expression).

## Function
ADCY3, or adenylyl cyclase 3, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This conversion is crucial for processes such as olfactory signal transduction, where ADCY3 is highly expressed in olfactory sensory neurons and localized in olfactory cilia. Here, it generates cAMP upon activation by odorant receptors, facilitating the sensation of smell (Hanoune1997Adenylyl; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

In the central nervous system, ADCY3 is found in several brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, and hippocampus, and is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as glial cells. It is involved in neuronal signaling via metabotropic GPCRs, contributing to neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity (Devasani2022Expression; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

ADCY3 also plays a role in energy balance and metabolism. It is expressed in adipose tissue and has been linked to the regulation of body weight and fat mass. Genetic studies associate ADCY3 polymorphisms with obesity, suggesting its involvement in metabolic processes (Wu2016Adenylate; Tong2016Adenylyl). Additionally, ADCY3 is active in pancreatic islets, where it influences insulin release, further highlighting its role in metabolic regulation (Wu2016Adenylate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADCY3 gene are significantly associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. Loss-of-function mutations in ADCY3 have been linked to monogenic severe obesity, as evidenced by studies involving both human subjects and animal models. These mutations can lead to truncated proteins and disrupted metabolic regulation, resulting in increased adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance (S2018Lossoffunction). In particular, ADCY3 is expressed in the hypothalamus and plays a crucial role in energy, lipid, and glucose control, mediating the action of anorexigenic gut peptides like GLP1 (S2018Lossoffunction).

Genetic studies have shown that ADCY3 polymorphisms are associated with obesity in various populations, including European and Chinese groups. These polymorphisms can influence body mass index (BMI) and fat mass, with certain alleles increasing susceptibility to obesity while others may offer protective effects (Wu2016Adenylate). Epigenetic modifications, such as increased DNA methylation of ADCY3, have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity (Ye2022ALDH2).

In addition to obesity, ADCY3 variants have been associated with other conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Ye2022ALDH2; Nordman2007Genetic).
