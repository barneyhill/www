# GOLGA6L10

## Overview
GOLGA6L10 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 10, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil structure and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A6 family like 10 is thought to play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and may be involved in vesicular trafficking processes. Although the specific functions of GOLGA6L10 and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, they are believed to contribute to the complex network of interactions that facilitate intracellular transport and communication (Qiu2020aarFDC).
