# SSTR1

## Overview
The SSTR1 gene encodes the somatostatin receptor 1, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in mediating the effects of the peptide hormone somatostatin. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including the inhibition of hormone and neurotransmitter release, and is expressed in multiple tissues such as the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. As a transmembrane receptor, somatostatin receptor 1 is involved in complex signaling pathways that regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and immune responses. Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in tumor biology, where alterations in SSTR1 expression have been linked to cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes (Günther2018International; Kumar2005Somatostatin).

## Function
Somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various signaling pathways that regulate numerous physiological processes. In healthy human cells, SSTR1 plays a crucial role in inhibiting the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters. It is expressed in diverse tissues, including the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and immune cells (Günther2018International; TANIYAMA2005Systemic).

In the central nervous system, SSTR1 functions as an inhibitory autoreceptor, modulating neurotransmitter release, such as glutamate and GABA, and influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Günther2018International). It also regulates stress-induced gut motor functions and inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone release (Günther2018International).

SSTR1 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells and affects growth hormone secretion in the anterior pituitary (Günther2018International). It also mediates anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells like macrophages and has potential angio-inhibitory effects in vascular tissues (Günther2018International).

At the molecular level, SSTR1 activates the MAP kinase pathway, which can lead to cell growth inhibition and differentiation. This involves the activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases and the MAPK pathway, which can halt cell growth by upregulating the cell cycle inhibitor p21/Cip1 (Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin; Florio1999Somatostatin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SSTR1 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of tumors and cancer. In breast cancer, SSTR1 is expressed in a significant majority of tumor samples, with its expression levels correlating with estrogen receptor (ER) status. Tumors with higher SSTR1 expression often have a positive ER status, which can influence the effectiveness of therapies involving somatostatin analogs (Kumar2005Somatostatin). The expression of SSTR1, along with other somatostatin receptor subtypes, is also influenced by hormonal factors and can serve as a growth inhibitory system in tumors, potentially affecting cell proliferation and tumor development (Kumar2005Somatostatin).

While the study by Carless et al. did not find a direct association between SSTR1 polymorphisms and breast cancer or solar keratosis, it highlights the potential of SSTR polymorphisms as markers in cancer research (Carless2001Association). The expression of SSTR1 in various tumors suggests its role in tumor biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies, including the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs for diagnosis and treatment (Kumar2005Somatostatin).

## Interactions
Somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1) interacts with various proteins to mediate its signaling functions. It is coupled to G proteins, specifically Gai3 and Gai1/2, which inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and activate protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity, particularly SHP-2. This interaction leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, influencing cell growth (Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin). SSTR1 also activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which phosphorylates and activates SHP-2, further propagating signaling events (Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin).

SSTR1 does not heterodimerize with other receptors and internalizes after agonist treatment, recycling back to the cell surface without undergoing lysosomal degradation (Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin). In CHO-SSTR1 cells, SSTR1 stimulates SHP-2 activity, which interacts with c-src, a member of the src family kinases. This interaction is constitutive and not affected by somatostatin treatment, suggesting that SHP-2 and c-src may participate in the same signaling complex (Florio1999Somatostatin). These interactions highlight the complex signaling pathways mediated by SSTR1, contributing to its role in cellular responses.
