# ZWINT

## Overview
ZWINT is a gene that encodes the ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein, a crucial component of the kinetochore complex involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis. The ZWINT protein functions as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly and stability of the kinetochore by bridging interactions between inner and outer kinetochore components. It is essential for the proper localization of the ZW10 protein to kinetochores, which is critical for mitotic checkpoint signaling and accurate chromosome segregation (Wang2004Human; Vos2011hZwint1). ZWINT is phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase, a modification necessary for recruiting the RZZ complex to kinetochores, thereby ensuring proper chromosome movement and alignment (Kasuboski2011Zwint1). Alterations in ZWINT expression have been implicated in various cancers, where its dysregulation is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression (Zhu2021Prognostic; Li2020ZW10).

## Structure
The ZWINT protein, also known as hZwint-1, is a component of the kinetochore complex involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis. The primary structure of ZWINT includes specific domains essential for its function. The N-terminal region, spanning amino acids 40-109, is crucial for kinetochore localization, while the C-terminal region, encompassing amino acids 195-236, is necessary for interaction with the kinetochore checkpoint protein hZw10 (Vos2011hZwint1). ZWINT contains two predicted coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Vos2011hZwint1).

ZWINT is phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase at three specific sites near its C-terminus (S250, T251, S262). This post-translational modification is critical for the recruitment of the RZZ complex to kinetochores, which is essential for proper kinetochore function and spindle assembly checkpoint signaling (Kasuboski2011Zwint1). The protein's interaction with hZw10 and its role in kinetochore assembly suggest that ZWINT functions as a stable structural component, bridging the inner and outer kinetochore (Vos2011hZwint1). The quaternary structure of ZWINT likely involves its integration into larger protein complexes at the kinetochore, although specific details are not fully elucidated.

## Function
ZWINT (ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein) plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a key structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. It is essential for the proper localization of ZW10 to kinetochores, which is crucial for mitotic checkpoint signaling and accurate chromosome segregation (Wang2004Human). ZWINT acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the connection between inner and outer kinetochore components, and interacts with several proteins in the KMN network, including hHec1, hSpc24, and hSpc25 (Vos2011hZwint1).

ZWINT is also a substrate of Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates it to enable the recruitment of the RZZ complex, including ZW10, to kinetochores. This phosphorylation is necessary for the assembly of a dynein-binding platform, which is essential for proper chromosome movement and alignment during mitosis (Kasuboski2011Zwint1). The protein is active at the centromere, ensuring accurate mitotic progression and genomic stability by maintaining the integrity of chromosome segregation (Wang2004Human). Through these interactions and processes, ZWINT contributes to the fidelity of chromosome segregation and the maintenance of genomic stability in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
ZWINT (ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In breast cancer, ZWINT mRNA expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, particularly in subtypes such as mucinous, medullary, invasive lobular, and invasive ductal carcinoma. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival, and a higher risk of metastatic relapse (Li2020ZW10). Mutation analysis has identified missense and synonymous substitutions in ZWINT, with C>A and G>A mutations being the most common (Li2020ZW10).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high ZWINT expression correlates with poor prognosis, characterized by shorter overall and disease-free survival, and increased tumor recurrence. ZWINT promotes HCC cell proliferation by regulating cell-cycle-related proteins, and its knockdown results in cell cycle arrest and reduced tumor growth (Ying2018Overexpression).

ZWINT is also upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is linked to poor prognosis and advanced TNM stages. Its expression serves as an independent prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survival (Zhu2021Prognostic). In prostate cancer, ZWINT expression is associated with disease progression and immune infiltration, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor immune environment (Unknownauthors2023UpregulationoftheZWINTexpressioncorrelateswithprostatecancerprogressionandimmuneinfiltration).

## Interactions
ZWINT, also known as ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein, plays a crucial role in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during cell division. It interacts with the ZW10 protein, a component of the RZZ complex (Rod-ZW10-Zwilch), which is essential for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal region of ZW10, with the N-terminal 80 amino acids being sufficient for binding ZWINT (Wang2004Human). ZWINT is necessary for the proper localization of ZW10 to kinetochores, as demonstrated by RNA interference experiments that showed mislocalization of ZW10 when ZWINT was depleted (Wang2004Human).

ZWINT also interacts with several structural proteins within the kinetochore, including components of the KMN network such as the Ndc80 and Mis12 complexes. These interactions suggest that ZWINT acts as a scaffold protein, bridging the inner and outer kinetochore components (Vos2011hZwint1). The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of ZWINT is crucial for its interaction with ZW10, while the N-terminal region is necessary for kinetochore localization (Vos2011hZwint1). These interactions are vital for the assembly and function of the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (Wang2004Human).
