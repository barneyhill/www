# PRR13

## Overview
PRR13 (proline rich 13) is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 13, which is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer progression and treatment resistance. The protein is characterized by its proline-rich regions, which are often associated with protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways. PRR13 has been studied for its role in epithelial ovarian cancer and breast cancer, where its expression levels have been linked to patient outcomes and resistance to certain chemotherapies. The gene's expression is considered a potential prognostic marker, as it correlates with progression-free survival and overall survival in cancer patients (Pontikakis2016Predictive; Gu2020Ageassociated).

## Clinical Significance
PRR13 (proline rich 13) has been implicated in the progression and treatment resistance of certain cancers, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and breast cancer. In EOC, high expression levels of PRR13 are associated with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing platinum-taxane first-line therapy. This suggests that PRR13 may play a role in taxane resistance by down-regulating THBS1, a proapoptotic factor and angiogenesis inhibitor, thereby reducing the effectiveness of taxane-induced apoptosis (Pontikakis2016Predictive). The study found that patients with high PRR13 expression had significantly shorter median PFS and OS compared to those with low expression, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Pontikakis2016Predictive).

In breast cancer, PRR13 is one of the age-associated genes whose upregulation is linked to cancer progression. Knockdown of PRR13 in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, highlighting its role in tumor growth. PRR13 expression is also predictive of relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, underscoring its potential as a prognostic marker in this context (Gu2020Ageassociated).
