# LRR1

## Overview
LRR1, or leucine-rich repeat protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a vital cellular pathway for protein degradation. The protein encoded by LRR1 is characterized by leucine-rich repeats, which are motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. LRR1 functions as a component of the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, thereby influencing protein turnover and cellular homeostasis (Wimuttisuk2014Novel). It is also a part of the CRL2 Lrr1 complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the disassembly of the vertebrate replisome during DNA replication termination (Dewar2017CRL2Lrr1). The protein's activity is significant in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Additionally, LRR1 interacts with various proteins, such as BTB domain-containing proteins and PUB11 in Arabidopsis, highlighting its role in diverse cellular processes, including stress responses and protein degradation pathways (Chen2021Arabidopsis).

## Function
LRR1 (leucine-rich repeat protein 1) plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation in cells. It functions as a component of the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it binds specifically to Cul3, suggesting its involvement in the ubiquitination pathway (Wimuttisuk2014Novel). LRR1 interacts with BTB domain-containing proteins, such as Ctb73, within the Cul3 complex, potentially influencing the remodeling of E3 ligase complexes (Wimuttisuk2014Novel). This interaction is mediated by a B/C-like box domain on LRR1, which facilitates binding to Cul3 and BTB domain-containing proteins, altering their role from substrate adaptors to substrates for ubiquitination (Wimuttisuk2014Novel).

LRR1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Its activity in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating protein degradation pathways. By tagging proteins for degradation, LRR1 ensures the proper turnover of proteins, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal health. The presence of LRR1 in the Cul3 complex highlights its role in modulating the interactions and functions of other proteins within the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Wimuttisuk2014Novel).

## Interactions
LRR1 (leucine-rich repeat protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is a component of the CRL2 Lrr1 complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the disassembly of the vertebrate replisome during DNA replication termination. This complex includes other proteins such as Cul2, Elongin B (EloB), Elongin C (EloC), and the RING subunit Rbx1. LRR1 is responsible for the polyubiquitylation of the Mcm7 subunit of the CMG helicase complex, facilitating its unloading from chromatin by the p97 ATPase (Dewar2017CRL2Lrr1).

In Arabidopsis, LRR1 interacts with PUB11, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets LRR1 for degradation. This interaction is part of a regulatory mechanism affecting drought tolerance, where PUB11 ubiquitinates LRR1, leading to its degradation via the 26S proteasome (Chen2021Arabidopsis). These interactions highlight LRR1's role in protein degradation pathways and its involvement in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication and stress responses.
