# GPATCH8

## Overview
GPATCH8 is a gene that encodes the protein G-patch domain containing 8, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing, particularly in the regulation of RNA splicing. The protein is characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain, a motif known for its involvement in RNA binding and interaction with RNA helicases, such as DHX15, facilitating various RNA processing events (Memet2024Insights; Bohnsack2021Regulation). G-patch domain containing 8 is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, where it exhibits a distinct punctate staining pattern, suggesting a specialized function in RNA metabolism (Memet2024Insights). The protein is implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process essential for generating protein diversity from pre-mRNA transcripts, by potentially recruiting other factors and interacting with RNA helicases to influence exon inclusion or skipping (Memet2024Insights). While the specific functions of GPATCH8 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its interactions with RNA helicases and involvement in splicing regulation indicate a significant role in gene expression pathways (Memet2024Insights).

## Function
GPATCH8 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing, particularly in the regulation of RNA splicing. The protein contains a G-patch domain, which is known for its role in RNA binding and interaction with RNA helicases, such as DHX15, to facilitate RNA processing events (Memet2024Insights; Bohnsack2021Regulation). GPATCH8 is primarily active in the nucleoplasm, where it exhibits a unique punctate staining pattern, suggesting a specific subcellular localization that may indicate a distinct role in RNA metabolism (Memet2024Insights).

The protein is implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing, a critical process for generating protein diversity from pre-mRNA transcripts. GPATCH8, along with other G-patch proteins, influences splicing by potentially recruiting other factors and interacting with RNA helicases, thereby affecting exon inclusion or skipping in specific genes (Memet2024Insights). The protein's involvement in splicing regulation is supported by its interaction with RNA helicases, which are essential for the remodeling of RNA-protein complexes (Bohnsack2021Regulation).

Although the specific function of GPATCH8 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, its role in RNA splicing and interaction with RNA helicases suggests it plays a significant part in gene expression pathways (Memet2024Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPATCH8 gene have been associated with hyperuricemia, particularly in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). A study identified a missense mutation, c.2935G[C, in exon 8 of GPATCH8, which results in an amino acid substitution of p.A979P. This mutation was found to cosegregate with hyperuricemia in a Japanese family affected by OI. The mutation is located in a highly conserved serine-rich region of the GPATCH8 protein and is predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT analyses (Kaneko2011Hyperuricemia). The study suggests that this mutation in GPATCH8 is likely responsible for the hyperuricemia observed in the family (Kaneko2011Hyperuricemia).

The GPATCH8 gene encodes a protein involved in RNA processing, and alterations in its expression or interactions may disrupt cellular processes, potentially leading to disease development. While the study primarily highlights the association of GPATCH8 mutations with hyperuricemia in the context of OI, it does not provide a comprehensive list of other diseases associated with GPATCH8 mutations (Kaneko2011Hyperuricemia). The potential link between GPATCH8 and hyperuricemia underscores the importance of further research to elucidate the gene's role in other conditions.

## Interactions
GPATCH8 is known to interact with the RNA helicase DHX15, showing a significant fold enrichment in co-precipitation experiments, which suggests a strong interaction between these proteins (Memet2024Insights). This interaction is part of a broader network where DHX15 frequently associates with various G-patch proteins, indicating its regulation by multiple cofactors, including GPATCH8 (Memet2024Insights). 

The G-patch domain of GPATCH8 is crucial for its function, potentially recruiting helicases like DHX15 to target sites, which plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing (Memet2024Insights). GPATCH8's interactions with RNA helicases enhance the ATPase activity and RNA affinity of these enzymes, promoting efficient RNA processing (Bohnsack2021Regulation). 

GPATCH8 has also been identified as a potential interactor with PGRP3 through yeast two-hybrid screening, although the specific nature of this interaction is not extensively detailed (Lin2022Identification). The protein's localization in the nucleoplasm suggests it may influence RNA metabolism at an early stage in the gene expression pathway (Memet2024Insights).
