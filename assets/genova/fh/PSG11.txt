# PSG11

## Overview
PSG11 is a gene that encodes the protein pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein 11, which is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family within the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and is involved in immune modulation and possibly angiogenesis during pregnancy. The PSG11 protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate cell-cell recognition and interaction, and it undergoes alternative splicing to produce different isoforms. Notably, PSG11 is implicated in maintaining immune tolerance and supporting fetal development by modulating maternal immune responses, including the induction of TGF-β1 secretion in human monocytes (Moore2014Pregnancyspecific; Jeong2021Depletion). The gene has been associated with pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, highlighting its potential clinical significance in reproductive health (Zhao2012Genomewide).

## Structure
The human PSG11 gene encodes a protein that is part of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family within the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein structure of PSG11 includes immunoglobulin-like domains, which are characteristic of this family. Specifically, the PSG11 protein features a domain structure of L-N-AI-AII-BII-C, where each letter represents a distinct domain type (Brophy1992cDNA). This structure is indicative of the protein's role in cell-cell recognition and interaction.

PSG11 is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different splice variant isoforms. One such variant, PSG-11s, encodes a secreted protein consisting of 426 amino acids and includes six potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications in glycoproteins (Brophy1992cDNA). These glycosylation sites are important for the protein's stability and function.

The N-terminal and central domains of PSG11 are highly conserved, while the C-terminal domains exhibit variability in length and sequence, contributing to the diversity of the protein's functional capabilities (Brophy1992cDNA). The specific roles of these domains in PSG11's function during pregnancy are not fully understood, but they are believed to be significant due to their high expression levels in the placenta.

## Function
PSG11, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, is primarily expressed in the placenta and plays a role in immune modulation and possibly angiogenesis during pregnancy. It is involved in maintaining immune tolerance and supporting fetal development by modulating maternal immune responses (Jeong2021Depletion). PSG11 is known to induce the secretion of TGF-β1, an important cytokine in immune regulation, in human monocytes (Moore2014Pregnancyspecific). This induction of TGF-β1 suggests that PSG11 may contribute to the creation of an immunosuppressive environment necessary for successful pregnancy.

The protein encoded by PSG11 is characterized by its intracellular retention, attributed to its carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains signals for intracellular localization and stability (Chen1993The). This domain is crucial for the protein's retention and degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a potential role in intracellular signaling or interactions within placental cells (Chen1993The). The intracellular behavior of PSG11, including its retention and stability, is essential for understanding its function in healthy human cells, particularly in the context of placental development and maternal-fetal interactions (Chen1993The).

## Clinical Significance
The PSG11 gene has been implicated in preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific complication characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. A genome-wide association study identified a maternal copy-number deletion in the PSG11 gene, located in the 19q13.31 region, which was enriched among preeclampsia patients. This deletion was found in 3.0% of cases compared to 0.9% of controls, suggesting a potential association with PE (Zhao2012Genomewide). The deletion may contribute to the pathophysiology of PE by disrupting cytokine balance, potentially leading to uteroplacental hypoxia, a condition associated with PE (Zhao2012Genomewide).

The PSG11 gene is part of the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) family, which plays roles in immune regulation and angiogenesis. Alterations in PSG11 expression have been observed in patients with a history of recurrent abortion, indicating a potential link between PSG11 expression and reproductive disorders (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of PSG11 mutations or expression changes remains unclear due to underpowered studies and varied experimental designs (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). Further research is needed to establish the precise role of PSG11 in pregnancy-related disorders.
