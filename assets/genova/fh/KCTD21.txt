# KCTD21

## Overview
KCTD21 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 21, which is a member of the KCTD protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, which facilitates protein oligomerization and interactions with other proteins (Esposito2022Alphafold; Liu2013The). KCTD21 is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as an adaptor protein for Cullin E3 ligases, suggesting its participation in ubiquitination and protein degradation pathways (Skoblov2013Protein). The protein is predicted to form pentameric assemblies, although the structural reliability of these models requires further validation (Esposito2022Alphafold). KCTD21 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, where it may influence tumorigenesis and progression through its interactions with other proteins and regulatory RNAs (Shi2022Comprehensive; Liang2024m6Amethylated). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular roles of KCTD21.

## Structure
The KCTD21 protein is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing family and is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, which facilitates protein oligomerization and interactions with other proteins (Esposito2022Alphafold; Liu2013The). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of KCTD21 is predicted to form a propeller-like structure with a central cavity, surrounded by five symmetrical irregularly structured regions, which is a common feature among KCTD family proteins (Esposito2022Alphafold). 

The protein is predicted to form pentameric assemblies, although the reliability of this structure is considered lower compared to other members of its cluster (Esposito2022Alphafold). Despite the lack of significant sequence similarity with other KCTD proteins, the structural organization of KCTD21 is similar to other members of Cluster 2, with single chains exhibiting a similar fold and pentamers assembled in an analogous fashion (Esposito2022Alphafold). 

The BTB domain of KCTD21 shares high sequence identity with other KCTD proteins, such as KCTD6, which suggests a conserved role in oligomerization and protein-protein interactions (Pirone2013Thermal).

## Function
KCTD21 is a member of the KCTD protein family, which is characterized by its role as an adaptor protein for Cullin E3 ligases, suggesting its involvement in ubiquitination processes. This protein family is known for its participation in protein degradation pathways, particularly through the ubiquitination of histone deacetylase HDAC1, a process in which KCTD21 is involved (Skoblov2013Protein). 

KCTD21, like other KCTD proteins, is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cellular signaling and regulation. Although specific details about the function of KCTD21 in healthy human cells are limited, its general role in ubiquitination suggests it may influence protein stability and turnover, impacting cellular homeostasis and function (Skoblov2013Protein).

The protein's activity is likely associated with its ability to form complexes with other proteins, potentially affecting signal transduction pathways. However, the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular locations of KCTD21's activity remain under investigation, and further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in normal cellular physiology (Skoblov2013Protein).

## Clinical Significance
KCTD21 is implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KCTD21-AS1, a long non-coding RNA associated with KCTD21, is overexpressed and linked to poor patient survival. This overexpression promotes NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis and progression (Liang2024m6Amethylated). The interaction between KCTD21-AS1 and miR-519d-5p is crucial, as miR-519d-5p acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and metastasis. KCTD21-AS1 functions as a competing endogenous RNA, blocking miR-519d-5p's effects and thereby promoting tumorigenesis (Liang2024m6Amethylated).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KCTD21 expression is significantly higher at the mRNA level, although protein expression is low, indicating complex regulation. This gene is associated with different tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, and its expression levels differ between TP53-Mutant and TP53-Nonmutant groups, suggesting a potential role in LUAD progression and as a prognostic marker (Shi2022Comprehensive).

KCTD21 is also part of a cluster of KCTD genes with increased expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), indicating its involvement in the carcinogenic transformation of lymphoblasts (Buono2023A).

## Interactions
KCTD21 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its role as an adaptor protein for Cullin E3 ligases, which are crucial in ubiquitination and protein degradation pathways. KCTD21, along with KCTD6 and KCTD11, is implicated in the ubiquitination of histone deacetylase HDAC1, highlighting its role in protein degradation processes (Skoblov2013Protein). The BTB domain of KCTD21 facilitates these interactions, allowing it to form complexes with other proteins in the KCTD family, such as KCTD5, KCTD6, and KCTD11 (Liu2013The).

KCTD21 is also predicted to form pentameric structures, although these models require further validation. This structural feature is significant for its function in protein oligomerization and interaction with other cellular components (Esposito2022Alphafold). The protein's ability to bind Cullin 3 is not universal among all KCTD proteins, suggesting that KCTD21 may have alternative interaction partners beyond the Cullin 3 complex (Esposito2022Alphafold).

These interactions position KCTD21 as a key player in cellular signaling modulation and protein degradation, contributing to its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes (Skoblov2013Protein).
