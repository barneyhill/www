# MTHFD2L

## Overview
The MTHFD2L gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 2 like, which plays a pivotal role in folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase, reflecting its dual functionality in catalyzing the conversion of methylenetetrahydrofolate to methenyltetrahydrofolate and subsequently to formyltetrahydrofolate. MTHFD2L is integral to mitochondrial folate metabolism, contributing to nucleotide biosynthesis and amino acid interconversion, and is capable of utilizing both NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactors (Shin2014Mitochondrial; Shin2017Human). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and lung, indicating its significance in rapidly growing or differentiating tissues (Shin2014Mitochondrial). Its ability to adapt to varying metabolic conditions underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial redox balance and cellular metabolic homeostasis (Shin2017Human).

## Structure
The MTHFD2L gene encodes a mitochondrial methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase isozyme involved in folate metabolism. The protein is approximately 340 amino acids long and includes a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, which directs it to the mitochondria (Bolusani2011Mammalian). This sequence is characterized by the potential to form a positively charged amphipathic α helix, indicative of its role in mitochondrial localization (Bolusani2011Mammalian).

MTHFD2L exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in at least three classes of transcripts. Class I transcripts skip exon 2, encoding a 347-amino acid protein. Class II transcripts retain exon 2, potentially leading to an early termination product of 60 amino acids, but translation from an AUG codon in exon 3 would produce a protein identical to the last 289 amino acids of the class I protein. Class III transcripts skip both exon 2 and exon 8 (Bolusani2011Mammalian). The presence of exon 8 is crucial for the enzyme's activity, as its absence results in a lack of NAD+-dependent CH2-THF dehydrogenase activity (Shin2014Mitochondrial).

The protein is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, suggesting its role in folate-dependent 1-carbon metabolism at this location (Bolusani2011Mammalian). MTHFD2L functions as a dual redox cofactor-specific enzyme, capable of using both NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactors (Shin2014Mitochondrial).

## Function
The MTHFD2L gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, which is crucial for various biological processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid interconversion, and redox cofactor regeneration. This enzyme functions as both a methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and a methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, utilizing NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactors (Shin2014Mitochondrial; Shin2017Human). MTHFD2L plays a significant role in the mitochondrial production of formate from one-carbon donors like serine, glycine, and sarcosine, which is essential for cytoplasmic nucleotide and methyl group synthesis (Shin2014Mitochondrial).

The enzyme is expressed in both adult and embryonic tissues, with the highest levels in the brain and lung, suggesting its importance in tissues undergoing rapid growth or differentiation (Shin2014Mitochondrial). MTHFD2L's dual redox cofactor specificity allows it to adapt to changing metabolic conditions, influencing the balance of one-carbon units in mitochondria and affecting the equilibrium between 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (Shin2017Human). This adaptability is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial NADPH/NADP+ redox homeostasis, which is vital for cellular metabolism and function (Shin2017Human).
