# GAGE2E

## Overview
GAGE2E is a gene that belongs to the GAGE family, which is a group of cancer/testis antigens typically expressed in a variety of tumors but not in normal tissues, except for the testis. The GAGE2E gene encodes the G antigen 2E protein, which is implicated in oncogenic processes due to its interaction with transcriptional regulators such as Germ Cell-less (GCL). This interaction may influence cell proliferation and cancer-related pathways, potentially affecting E2F-DP-dependent gene expression (Gjerstorff2012GAGE). The aberrant expression of GAGE2E has been associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, where it is linked to reduced survival rates in patients not treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Kalvapudi2024Cancertestis). Given its restricted expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors, GAGE2E is considered a promising target for cancer immunotherapy (Gjerstorff2012GAGE).

## Clinical Significance
The GAGE2E gene, part of the GAGE family, is associated with various cancers due to its aberrant expression patterns. In gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEAC), the expression of the GAGE2E gene, along with GAGE2C and GAGE2A, has been linked to poorer overall survival in patients not treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Specifically, patients positive for this gene cluster had a median survival of 15 months compared to 29 months for those who were negative, indicating a potential negative impact on survival outcomes (Kalvapudi2024Cancertestis).

GAGE proteins, including GAGE2E, are known to interact with the transcriptional regulator Germ Cell-less (GCL), which may influence cell proliferation and cancer-related processes. This interaction suggests that GAGE2E could play a role in oncogenic processes by potentially affecting E2F-DP-dependent gene expression, which is involved in cell proliferation (Gjerstorff2012GAGE). The expression of GAGE proteins, including GAGE2E, is often correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancers, further supporting their role in tumorigenesis (Gjerstorff2012GAGE). These findings highlight the potential of GAGE2E as a target for cancer immunotherapy, given its restricted expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors.
