# RBP7

## Overview
Retinol Binding Protein 7 (RBP7) is a gene that encodes a member of the cellular retinol-binding protein family, specifically involved in the transport and metabolism of retinol. The protein product, RBP7, is categorized as a lipocalin, characterized by its β-barrel structure that facilitates the binding of small hydrophobic molecules such as retinol (Elmasry2019RBP7; Blaner2020Retinolbinding). RBP7 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissues and plays a crucial role in adipogenesis and retinol metabolism, acting under the regulation of the nuclear receptor PPARγ (Kim2022Retinol). Additionally, RBP7 is significant in vascular endothelial function, where it contributes to the protection against oxidative stress and supports lipid dynamics and energy metabolism (Woll2024Role). Clinically, alterations in RBP7 expression have been linked to hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, where it functions as a tumor suppressor, influencing cell proliferation and survival outcomes (Yu2024RBP7).

## Structure
The RBP7 protein, a member of the cellular retinol-binding protein family, is composed of 134 amino acids and is involved in the transport and metabolism of retinol (Elmasry2019RBP7; Yu2024RBP7). The primary structure of RBP7 includes a sequence that is highly conserved across species, with significant homology to human sequences, indicating evolutionary conservation (Ahn2019Adipose‐Specific). 

The secondary structure of RBP7 is characterized by ten continuous β-strands that form a barrel structure, similar to other members of the lipocalin superfamily, such as fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) (Ahn2019Adipose‐Specific). This β-barrel structure creates a hydrophobic cavity that is crucial for binding retinol and other small hydrophobic molecules (Blaner2020Retinolbinding).

The tertiary structure of RBP7 is defined by this compact β-barrel architecture, which is typical of lipocalins, providing a stable environment for ligand binding. The protein's structure is further stabilized by conserved residues, such as Gly and Trp in the GXW motif, which are important for maintaining the integrity of the binding site (Ahn2019Adipose‐Specific).

There is no specific information on the quaternary structure of RBP7, as it typically functions as a monomer. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications that influence its function and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Retinol Binding Protein 7 (RBP7) is involved in the regulation of adipogenesis and retinol metabolism. It is abundantly expressed in white and brown adipose tissues, with higher expression in adipocytes compared to the stromal vascular fraction. RBP7 is under the control of PPARγ, a key regulator of adipogenesis, and its overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes promotes differentiation, increases triglyceride accumulation, and upregulates genes such as Pparγ, Fabp4, C/ebpα, and AdipoQ. Conversely, RBP7 deficiency leads to reduced lipid accumulation and triglyceride levels, effects that can be reversed by retinoic acid supplementation (Kim2022Retinol).

RBP7 also plays a role in the vascular endothelium, where it is crucial for protecting vascular function during oxidative stress. It is involved in lipid dynamics and energy metabolism, and its deficiency leads to severe endothelial dysfunction under prooxidant stressors. RBP7 is thought to mediate the protective antioxidant effects of PPARγ, potentially acting as a ligand carrier protein for nuclear receptors (Woll2024Role). The protein's function in endothelial cells includes enhancing PPARγ activity, which is important for maintaining proper vascular function and signaling (Woll2024Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RBP7 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HR+ BC). RBP7 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, and its expression is notably downregulated in HR+ BC tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression. Patients with lower RBP7 expression levels have poorer overall survival rates, with a median survival time of 9.1 years compared to 10.6 years for those with higher expression levels (Yu2024RBP7). 

RBP7's role in fatty acid metabolism is also clinically significant. It inhibits the AKT/SREBP1 pathway, reducing fatty acid content in HR+ BC cells, which is linked to decreased tumor growth in xenograft models (Yu2024RBP7). The gene's expression is negatively correlated with tumor T-stage and Ki67 score, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Yu2024RBP7). These findings suggest that RBP7 could serve as a therapeutic target to improve prognosis, decrease drug resistance, and prevent recurrence in HR+ BC patients (Yu2024RBP7).

## Interactions
Retinol Binding Protein 7 (RBP7) is known to interact with several proteins and participate in various signaling pathways. RBP7 is part of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family and is involved in the transport of retinol derivatives, acting as a ligand carrier for nuclear receptors. It interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARγ, a key regulator of vasomotor function and arterial blood pressure, although the specific cargo it carries to PPARγ remains unclear (Woll2024Role). RBP7 may also affect PPARγ activity indirectly by delivering ligands to the retinoid X receptor (RXR), PPARγ's partner, suggesting a role in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling similar to other FABPs (Woll2024Role).

In the context of adipogenesis, RBP7 influences the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid response elements (RARE) and regulates the expression of genes involved in retinoid metabolism, such as Lrat, Raldh1, and Cyp26a1. These interactions suggest that RBP7 plays a significant role in the regulation of retinoid metabolism and adipogenesis through its interactions with nuclear receptors and retinoid metabolic genes (Kim2022Retinol). RBP7's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders and cancer.
