# C3orf38

## Overview
C3orf38 is a gene located on chromosome 3 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 3 open reading frame 38. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and interactions remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its role, studies suggest that C3orf38 may be involved in various cellular processes due to its expression in multiple tissues. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise functions and potential clinical significance of the C3orf38 protein, as well as its interactions with other molecular pathways.
