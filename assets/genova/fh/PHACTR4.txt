# PHACTR4

## Overview
PHACTR4 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase and actin regulator 4, which is a member of the Phactr family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its role as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and its interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major enzyme involved in dephosphorylation processes. PHACTR4 is integral to various cellular functions, including cell motility, neural tube development, and angiogenesis, by modulating actin dynamics and integrin signaling pathways (Huet2013Actinregulated; Majdalani2023A). The protein's ability to bind actin and influence PP1 activity positions it as a critical player in maintaining cellular integrity and function. Additionally, PHACTR4 has been implicated in tumor suppression and developmental processes, with mutations in the gene associated with cancer and developmental disorders (Kim2007Phactr4; Solimini2013STOP).

## Structure
The PHACTR4 protein is part of the Phactr family, characterized by the presence of RPEL domains that mediate actin binding. These domains are similar to those found in myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) and are involved in sensing actin monomer levels, which influences the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (Huet2013Actinregulated). The RPEL domain in PHACTR4 does not regulate its nuclear localization but plays a role in actin dynamics and PP1 regulation (Huet2013Actinregulated).

The C-terminal region of PHACTR4 is crucial for its interaction with PP1, and mutations in this region, such as the R650P mutation, disrupt PP1 binding without affecting actin interaction (Kim2007Phactr4; Solimini2013STOP). This interaction is essential for PHACTR4's role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression (Solimini2013STOP).

The N-terminal region of PHACTR4 is responsible for its plasma membrane localization, with basic residues contributing to this targeting. This localization is a conserved feature among Phactr proteins (Huet2013Actinregulated). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a complex regulatory role in cellular processes involving actin and PP1.

## Function
PHACTR4 (phosphatase and actin regulator 4) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell motility. It interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to modulate its activity, which is crucial for processes such as cell migration and neural tube development. PHACTR4 is involved in modulating integrin signaling and cofilin activity, which are essential for coordinating the forces that drive enteric neural crest cell (ENCC) migration in the mammalian embryo (Majdalani2023A). This suggests that PHACTR4 is integral to regulating cell movement and proliferation through its effects on signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics.

In healthy human cells, PHACTR4 is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in angiogenesis and neuronal development. It is associated with the plasma membrane in resting cells, indicating its role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Majdalani2023A). Although specific details on its function in healthy human cells are limited, PHACTR4's involvement in cytoskeletal regulation and its interaction with PP1 suggest it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Levran2021OPRD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PHACTR4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in cancer and developmental disorders. PHACTR4 is frequently deleted or mutated in several cancer types, including breast, colorectal, lung, neural, ovarian, and renal cancers. These genetic alterations often lead to increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, as PHACTR4 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cytoskeletal integrity (Solimini2013STOP). 

In cancer, the loss of PHACTR4 results in sustained phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), bypassing cell cycle arrest and promoting uncontrolled cell growth. Re-expression of PHACTR4 in cancer cell lines with reduced expression has been shown to significantly decrease proliferation and tumor formation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Solimini2013STOP).

In developmental contexts, mutations in PHACTR4 can lead to defects such as exencephaly and retinal coloboma due to disrupted neural tube and optic fissure closure. These defects are linked to the gene's role in regulating cell cycle progression through interactions with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), Rb, and E2F1 (Kim2007Phactr4).

## Interactions
Phactr4 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major dephosphorylating enzyme, and this interaction is crucial for regulating the phosphorylation status of cofilin, an actin-severing protein. Phactr4 acts as a targeting subunit for PP1, guiding it to dephosphorylate cofilin, which in turn regulates actin filament severing and maintains the actin monomer pool (Huet2013Actinregulated). The RPEL domain of Phactr4 binds actin, and this interaction influences the competitive binding of PP1, affecting PP1's activity and cofilin phosphorylation (Huet2013Actinregulated).

Phactr4 also interacts with integrin signaling pathways, particularly β1 integrin, at cell protrusions. It colocalizes with β1 integrin and cofilin, coordinating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and regulating directional cell migration. Phactr4 acts as a negative regulator of integrin signaling, affecting the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and cofilin, which are crucial for cell movement (Zhang2012Phactr4).

In adult neural stem cells, Phactr4 forms associations with intermediate filaments such as nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) fibers. This interaction is regulated by protein phosphorylation and is crucial for the structural organization within these cells (Cho2014Phosphatase).
