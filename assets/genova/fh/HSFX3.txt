# HSFX3

## Overview
HSFX3 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock transcription factor family, X-linked member 3, which is part of the heat shock transcription factor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are essential for cellular protection against stress by facilitating proper protein folding and preventing aggregation. As a transcriptional activator, the HSFX3 protein binds to DNA within the nucleus to regulate the transcription of genes associated with cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis. Notably, HSFX3 has been implicated in the immune response, particularly in the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, where it is differentially expressed in individuals undergoing seroconversion in QuantiFERON-TB Gold tests (Weiner2019Changes; Weiner2019Analysis; Shen2022AnimalTFDB). Further research is required to fully understand its function in healthy human cells.

## Function
HSFX3 is a member of the heat shock transcription factor family, which is crucial for regulating the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). These proteins play a significant role in protecting cells from stress by ensuring proper protein folding and preventing aggregation. HSFX3 functions as a transcriptional activator, binding to DNA in the nucleus to modulate the transcription of target genes involved in cellular stress responses and maintaining protein homeostasis (Shen2022AnimalTFDB).

In the context of immune response, HSFX3 has been identified as one of the most differentially expressed genes in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, particularly in individuals who convert from a negative to a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT) status. This suggests that HSFX3 may have a role in the immune response to infections, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Weiner2019Changes; Weiner2019Analysis).

Overall, HSFX3 is involved in the regulation of stress response pathways, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and potentially playing a role in the immune response to infections. However, detailed functional studies in healthy human cells are still needed to fully elucidate its role.
