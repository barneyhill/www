# FYB1

## Overview
FYB1, or FYN binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes the adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP), a critical component in immune cell signaling. This protein functions primarily as an adaptor in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways, facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules and playing a pivotal role in T cell activation and immune response modulation (Cai2023Transcriptomic; Lettau2010The). FYB1 is characterized by its SH3 domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the Src family kinase FYN and the cytoplasmic adapter protein SLP-76 (Liu2024FYB1targeted; Borowicz2020Adaptor). The protein is expressed in several immune cells, including T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, where it influences cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and cytokine synthesis (Liu2024FYB1targeted). FYB1's involvement in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and integrin activation underscores its importance in the formation of the immunological synapse and lymphocyte extravasation, making it a significant player in maintaining immune homeostasis and effective immune responses (Lettau2010The).

## Structure
FYB1 (FYN binding protein 1), also known as adhesion and degranulation promoting linker protein (ADAP), is a crucial component in T-cell receptor signaling. It acts as a bridging protein in the FYN and LCP2 signaling cascades, playing a significant role in T cell activation (Cai2023Transcriptomic). FYB1 contains an SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, essential for its function in immune signaling pathways (Borowicz2020Adaptor). 

The protein is expressed on primary natural killer cells and lymphocyte-activated killer cells, enhancing antitumor responses (Cai2023Transcriptomic). Post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, are known to regulate its function by affecting T-cell receptor attachment (Cai2023Transcriptomic). 

FYB1 interacts with other proteins, such as SKAP1 and SKAP2, which protect it from degradation and are crucial for its function in T-cell signaling (Levillayer2023Role). The interaction with SKAP1 is particularly important for stabilizing immune synapses (Levillayer2023Role). Although the specific details of its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, its role in immune cell signaling and interaction with other proteins highlights its functional importance.

## Function
FYB1, also known as adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP), plays a crucial role in T cell activation and immune cell signaling. It acts as a bridging protein in the FYN and LCP2 signaling cascades, facilitating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and integrin activation, which are essential for the formation of the immunological synapse and lymphocyte extravasation (Cai2023Transcriptomic; Lettau2010The). FYB1 is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and immune synapse formation. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it interacts with the Src family kinase FYN and the cytoplasmic adapter protein SLP-76 (Liu2024FYB1targeted).

In healthy human cells, FYB1 is expressed in various immune cells, including T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, where it regulates cellular migration, proliferation, and cytokine synthesis (Liu2024FYB1targeted). Its role in T cell activation is further supported by its involvement in the recruitment of the small Ras-like GTPase Rap1, which is necessary for integrin activation (Lettau2010The). FYB1's function in immune signaling is critical for effective immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FYB1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A deleterious mutation in the FYB1 gene, specifically a homozygous nonsense mutation c.393G>A, is associated with congenital autosomal recessive small-platelet thrombocytopenia (CARST). This condition is characterized by a reduced number of mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, small platelet size, and increased bleeding tendency due to impaired platelet function (Levin2015Deleterious). The mutation leads to premature termination of the ADAP protein, affecting platelet activation and function (Levin2015Deleterious).

In cancer, FYB1 is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it acts as a pro-oncogene. Elevated FYB1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients, promoting cell proliferation and survival. Knockdown of FYB1 in AML cell lines results in increased apoptosis and reduced cell viability, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2024FYB1targeted). FYB1 is also implicated in other cancers, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and breast cancer, where its expression correlates with disease progression and metastasis (Liu2024FYB1targeted).

## Interactions
FYB1 (FYN binding protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions critical for T-cell signaling. It binds to the Src family kinase FYN, acting as a substrate for FYN kinase, which phosphorylates FYB1 upon T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement (Liu1998FYB; da1997Cloning). FYB1 also interacts with the hematopoietic signaling protein SLP-76, with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 specifically recognizing FYB1. This interaction is crucial for T-cell receptor signaling pathways (da1997Cloning).

FYB1 serves as a binding partner for SKAP55 and SKAP55R, which are substrates for FYN kinase. These interactions occur through the SH3 domains of SKAP55 and SKAP55R, highlighting FYB1's role in T-cell signaling cascades (Liu1998FYB). FYB1 is also involved in the formation of the immunological synapse by associating with adapter proteins such as SKAP1/SKAP55 and SKAP2/SKAP55R, facilitating the recruitment of the small GTPase Rap1, which is necessary for integrin activation (Lettau2010The).

Additionally, FYB1 interacts with the adapter protein Nck, where the SH2 domain of Nck binds to FYB1, suggesting a role in TCR-triggered integrin activation and cytoskeletal reorganization (Lettau2010The). These interactions underscore FYB1's involvement in modulating immune cell signaling and function.
