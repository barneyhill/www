# JUNB

## Overview
JUNB is a gene that encodes the JunB proto-oncogene, a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which is integral to the regulation of gene expression in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The JunB protein is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates its dimerization and DNA-binding capabilities, classifying it as a transcription factor (Deng1993JunB). As a member of the AP-1 family, JunB plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is particularly significant in the regulation of immune responses and placental development, where it modulates the expression of genes involved in vascularization and immune cell function (SchorppKistner1999JunB; Katagiri2021Regulation). The protein's ability to form heterodimers with other AP-1 components, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, allows it to act as both an activator and repressor of transcription, depending on the cellular context (Deng1993JunB). Alterations in JUNB expression are associated with various pathological conditions, including cancers and immune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Fan2016The; Ren2023JunB:).

## Structure
The JUNB protein is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and features a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for its dimerization and DNA-binding capabilities (Deng1993JunB). The primary structure of JUNB includes specific amino acid sequences that differ from its closely related protein, c-Jun, particularly in the amino-terminal half, which affects its transcriptional activation domain (Deng1993JunB). The carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domains are highly conserved between JUNB and c-Jun, with four key amino acid changes significantly impacting DNA-binding activity (Deng1993JunB).

The secondary structure of JUNB is characterized by a combination of random coils and α-helices, forming a helix-turn-helix structure that facilitates DNA binding (Fu2020Molecular). The leucine zipper domain, a prominent feature of its tertiary structure, is essential for dimerization, aligning leucine residues along an alpha-helix to form a coiled-coil structure (Ransone1990Domain).

JUNB can form heterodimers with c-Jun, which are less active in DNA binding compared to c-Jun homodimers, thus acting as a repressor of c-Jun activity (Deng1993JunB). The protein's quaternary structure involves these dimerization interactions, which are crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator.

## Function
The JUNB gene encodes a protein that is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor family, which plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into changes in gene transcription. In healthy cells, JUNB is highly expressed in extra-embryonic tissues and is essential for mammalian placentation. It regulates the expression of genes such as proliferin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), which are crucial for neovascularization of the decidua and proper vascular interactions with maternal circulation (SchorppKistner1999JunB).

JUNB is also involved in the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are important for maintaining immune tolerance. It binds to the promoter region of the Il2ra gene, regulating its expression and thus influencing IL-2 sensitivity and secretion, which are vital for Treg cell survival and activation (Katagiri2021Regulation).

In the context of cellular regulation, JUNB acts as a negative regulator of c-Jun, another component of the AP-1 complex. It inhibits c-Jun's activation of transcription, thereby preventing overexpression of c-Jun in response to stimuli like mitogens or phorbol esters (Chiu1989JunB).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JUNB gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and immune disorders. In multiple myeloma (MM), JUNB is upregulated in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) from bone marrow stromal cells, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance, particularly against dexamethasone and bortezomib (Fan2016The). JUNB also plays a role in angiogenesis in MM, correlating with the expression of angiogenic factors and vessel density (Fan2021JunB).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), JUNB is significantly downregulated, contributing to disease progression. This downregulation is associated with an expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, leading to a myeloproliferative disorder (Hoshino2009Downregulation). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), JUNB is also downregulated, affecting cell cycle and differentiation, with its restoration potentially improving disease outcomes (Ren2023JunB:).

JUNB is implicated in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis, where it serves as a marker for CD16+ monocytes, and its absence in regulatory T cells can lead to inflammatory disorders (Ren2023JunB:). In inflammatory liver disease, JUNB regulates IFN-γ and IL-2 production, influencing the severity of liver damage (Thomsen2013JUNBAP1).

## Interactions
JunB, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, participates in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function as a transcriptional regulator. JunB forms heterodimers with c-Jun, which are less efficient in DNA-binding compared to c-Jun homodimers, thereby repressing c-Jun's activity by forming inactive heterodimers (Deng1993JunB). JunB also interacts with c-Fos to form heterodimers that have higher DNA-binding activity than JunB homodimers, although these are less active in gene activation compared to c-Jun:c-Fos dimers (Deng1993JunB).

In cardiac cells, JunB forms heterodimers with Fra1 and FosB, which bind to the AP-1 site within the MMP-2 promoter, playing a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-2, particularly under hypoxic conditions (BERGMAN2003A). JunB also interacts with the activation domain 1 (AD1) of BRCA1 through a coiled-coil-mediated mechanism, enhancing BRCA1's transcriptional activation function (Hu2002JunB). These interactions highlight JunB's role in modulating transcriptional activity through its ability to form specific protein complexes.
