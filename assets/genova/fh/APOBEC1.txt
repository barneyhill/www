# APOBEC1

## Overview
APOBEC1 is a gene that encodes the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 1, a member of the cytidine deaminase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional editing of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA, where it catalyzes the deamination of cytidine to uridine, resulting in the production of a truncated form of apoB known as apoB-48. This process is crucial for lipid metabolism, particularly in the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons in the small intestine (Nakamuta1996Complete; Blanc2010APOBEC‐1‐mediated). Beyond its role in lipid metabolism, APOBEC1 has been implicated in broader RNA editing activities and is associated with mutational processes that can contribute to oncogenesis, particularly in esophageal adenocarcinomas and liver diseases (Blanc2021Apobec1; Saraconi2014The). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with various proteins, including the APOBEC1 complementation factor (ACF), which is essential for its RNA editing function (Blanc2001Ô‖Identification; Mehta1996Apobec1).

## Structure
APOBEC1 is a cytidine deaminase involved in RNA editing, specifically targeting apolipoprotein B mRNA. The protein's primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form its polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure is characterized by a core five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices, which is typical of zinc-dependent cytidine deaminase domains (Pecori2022Functions). The tertiary structure involves a bilobal domain organization on a single polypeptide chain, with the N-terminal catalytic domain (NTCD) resembling the conserved catalytic domain of ScCDD1 (Xie2004The).

APOBEC1 functions as a dimer, which is essential for its RNA-editing activity. The dimeric state is characterized by a head-to-head oligomer orientation, with two active sites on opposite faces of the dimer (Xie2004The). The protein contains a zinc-binding domain crucial for its catalytic activity, coordinating a zinc ion with His-Glu and Cys-Cys motifs (Pecori2022Functions). The carboxy-terminal region includes a leucine-rich motif important for mRNA editing and dimerization (Teng1999Mutational). Specific loops within the deaminase fold, particularly loops 1, 3, 5, and 7, form the substrate binding groove, which is critical for enzymatic functionality (Pecori2022Functions). The protein's subcellular localization is influenced by an amino-terminal nuclear localization signal and a carboxy-terminal nuclear export signal (Pecori2022Functions).

## Function
APOBEC1 is a cytidine deaminase enzyme that plays a crucial role in RNA editing, specifically converting cytidine to uridine in apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA. This editing process results in the formation of a stop codon, which leads to the production of apoB-48 from apoB-100 mRNA. ApoB-48 is essential for the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons in the small intestine, which are vital for dietary lipid absorption and transport (Nakamuta1996Complete; Blanc2010APOBEC‐1‐mediated).

In humans, APOBEC1 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, where it functions in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells. Its activity is facilitated by the APOBEC1 complementation factor (ACF), which is necessary for efficient RNA binding and editing (Blanc2010APOBEC‐1‐mediated; Gonzalez2009Human). The enzyme's editing activity is highly specific, targeting a single cytidine residue in apoB mRNA, and is regulated by interactions with cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors (Blanc2010APOBEC‐1‐mediated).

APOBEC1's role extends beyond apoB mRNA editing, as it may also influence mRNA stability and participate in broader RNA metabolism processes, potentially affecting other mRNAs with AU-rich elements (Blanc2010APOBEC‐1‐mediated).

## Clinical Significance
APOBEC1 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in inducing somatic mutations and altering gene expression. Overexpression of APOBEC1 is associated with the development of esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs). It induces a mutational signature characterized by A to C transversions and C to T transitions, particularly at non-CpG sites, which are similar to those caused by other AID/APOBEC enzymes. This mutational activity is linked to the early stages of oncogenesis in Barrett's esophagus, a precursor to EAC, where APOBEC1 is highly expressed (Saraconi2014The).

In the context of liver disease, APOBEC1's interaction with the Apobec1 complementation factor (A1CF) is significant. Overexpression of A1CF, which is involved in RNA editing with APOBEC1, has been linked to hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This overexpression leads to increased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, contributing to liver disease progression and cancer development (Blanc2021Apobec1).

APOBEC1's ability to target DNA and induce mutations suggests its potential role in cancer evolution, contributing to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance (Pecori2022Functions).

## Interactions
APOBEC1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to perform its function in RNA editing. It forms a complex with the APOBEC1 complementation factor (ACF), a 65-kDa RNA-binding protein, which is essential for the C to U editing of apolipoprotein B mRNA. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a functional editing enzyme complex, with ACF acting as an RNA-binding subunit that docks APOBEC1 to its target cytidine in apoB mRNA (Blanc2001Ô‖Identification; Mehta1996Apobec1). The interaction between APOBEC1 and ACF follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, indicating a specific and high-affinity binding necessary for efficient editing (MEHTA2002Identification).

APOBEC1 also interacts with other proteins such as GRY-RBP, which can modulate the editing process by binding to ACF and inhibiting its interaction with apoB RNA. This inhibition can be reversed by increasing the concentration of ACF, suggesting a competitive interaction (Blanc2001Ô‖Identification). The dimerization of APOBEC1 is another important aspect of its interaction profile, although it is not essential for its RNA editing activity in the presence of ACF (Wolfe2020The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing APOBEC1's role in RNA editing.
