# CHAD

## Overview
The CHAD gene encodes the protein chondroadherin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan/protein (SLRP) family, specifically classified as a class IV SLRP. Chondroadherin is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage by mediating interactions between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and chondrocytes. It achieves this through binding with collagen, particularly type II collagen, and integrins, such as the α2β1 integrin, facilitating cell adhesion and signaling pathways crucial for cartilage development and repair (Sirin2018The; Paracuellos2017Structural). The protein's structure is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which contribute to its stability and function, and it forms noncovalent dimers in solution (Rämisch2017Crystal). CHAD's role extends beyond cartilage, as it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer, where its expression levels and genetic variants influence disease progression and susceptibility (Karyadi2016Whole; Deng2017Tumor).

## Structure
Chondroadherin (CHAD) is a protein characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which contribute to its structural stability and function. The primary structure of CHAD consists of 359 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide, an amino-terminal cysteine-rich region, 11 LRRs, and a unique carboxy-terminal double cysteine loop (Capulli2014The). The secondary structure features a classical horseshoe-shaped LRR fold, with a linear hydrophobic core and a concave site formed by a long parallel β-sheet with 13 strands (Rämisch2017Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of CHAD includes a well-ordered C-terminal cap structure that aligns with the LRRCT motif, differing from canonical small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) (Rämisch2017Crystal). The C-terminal cap contains a complete alpha-helix (residues 306-317) and is stabilized by disulfide bonds (Rämisch2017Crystal). 

In terms of quaternary structure, CHAD forms noncovalent dimers in solution, with a dimer interface located at the N-terminal half of the concave site (Rämisch2017Crystal). The dimeric arrangement is consistent with the dimer formation observed in the crystal structure (Rämisch2017Crystal). CHAD interacts with collagen type II and cell-surface proteoglycans, playing a role in cartilage matrix integrity (Månsson2001Association).

## Function
Chondroadherin (CHAD) is a protein encoded by the CHAD gene, primarily involved in maintaining cartilage structure and function. It is a class IV small leucine-rich proteoglycan/protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion by interacting with collagen and integrins, particularly type II collagen and the α2β1 integrin, to maintain cartilage integrity (Sirin2018The). CHAD is active in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it mediates signaling between chondrocytes and the ECM, contributing to tissue organization and influencing cellular signaling pathways that affect cartilage development and repair (Sirin2018The).

In healthy human cells, CHAD is involved in regulating chondrocyte signaling and cartilage homeostasis. It has been shown to affect the expression of other genes relevant to cartilage health, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and collagen type II (COL2A1), which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage (Sirin2018The). The expression of CHAD is influenced by treatments such as hyaluronic acid, which can enhance its expression and potentially aid in cartilage repair processes (Sirin2018The). CHAD's role in the ECM and its interactions with other proteins underscore its importance in maintaining the functional integrity of cartilage tissues.

## Clinical Significance
The CHAD (chondroadherin) gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low expression of CHAD is significantly associated with increased distant metastasis and lower differentiation levels in patients. Higher CHAD expression correlates with better prognosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene. Knockdown experiments in HCC cell lines have shown that reduced CHAD expression leads to increased proliferation and migration of cancer cells. In vivo studies further confirmed that overexpression of CHAD reduces lung metastasis in a mouse model, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker for HCC (Deng2017Tumor).

In prostate cancer, the CHAD gene variant p.Ala342Asp has been identified as a susceptibility gene. This variant is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, particularly non-aggressive forms, although it does not appear to be a major risk factor for aggressive prostate cancer. The variant was found in a significant number of families with hereditary prostate cancer, suggesting its role in genetic predisposition to the disease (Karyadi2016Whole).

## Interactions
Chondroadherin (CHAD) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a significant role in cartilage matrix integrity and cell-matrix interactions. CHAD binds to collagen, specifically identifying a unique binding site on collagen II, characterized by the sequence GAOGPSGFQGLOGPOGPO, which supports high-affinity interaction with a dissociation constant of approximately 75 nM (Paracuellos2017Structural). This interaction is crucial for collagen fibril assembly and cross-linking, although chondroadherin knockout mice exhibit normal bone collagen organization but altered mechanical properties (Paracuellos2017Structural).

CHAD also interacts with integrins, particularly the α2β1 integrin, through a specific binding site located at its C-terminal end. The integrin-binding motif includes the WLEAK sequence, with Trp314 and Leu315 being key residues for this interaction (Rämisch2017Crystal). This interaction facilitates cell adhesion and signaling, impacting chondrocyte function and cartilage integrity.

Additionally, CHAD binds to the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan cell-surface proteoglycans, influencing focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Rämisch2017Crystal). These interactions highlight CHAD's role in maintaining cartilage structure and function through its binding capabilities with various extracellular matrix components. There is no evidence of CHAD interacting with nucleic acids (Paracuellos2017Structural).
