# PHLDA1

## Overview
PHLDA1, or pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The protein, characterized by its pleckstrin homology-like (PHL) domain, plays a significant role in cell signaling, vesicular trafficking, and cytoskeletal rearrangement by binding phosphatidylinositol lipids (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin). PHLDA1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but can also be found in perinuclear, nucleolar, and nuclear regions, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular functions (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin). As a target gene of the tumor suppressor protein p53, PHLDA1 is implicated in p53-mediated cellular stress responses and is known to inhibit Akt activation, contributing to its tumor suppressive functions (Chen2018PHLDA1). The protein's expression is regulated by various signaling pathways, including MAPK and PKC, and it contains phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II and PKC, which are crucial for its regulatory functions (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin).

## Structure


## Function
PHLDA1, a member of the pleckstrin homology-like domain family, is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The protein encoded by PHLDA1 contains a pleckstrin homology-like (PHL) domain, which is crucial for its function in binding phosphatidylinositol lipids, thereby playing a role in cell signaling, vesicular trafficking, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin). PHLDA1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm but can also be found in perinuclear, nucleolar, and nuclear regions, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin).

PHLDA1 is a target gene of the tumor suppressor protein p53, and its expression is induced by DNA-damaging agents, suggesting a role in p53-mediated cellular responses to stress (Chen2018PHLDA1). The protein is known to inhibit Akt activation, a key pathway in cell growth and survival, thereby contributing to its tumor suppressive functions (Chen2018PHLDA1). PHLDA1's expression is regulated by various signaling pathways, including MAPK and PKC, and it contains phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II and PKC, which are important for its regulatory functions (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin).

## Clinical Significance
PHLDA1 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and mutations influencing disease progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, PHLDA1 expression is linked to estrogen receptor status, where high expression is associated with poor outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive tumors, while downregulation correlates with poor prognosis in general (NAGAI2016Pleckstrin). In colorectal and bladder cancers, PHLDA1 mutations, particularly in the pleckstrin domain, have been identified, with a somatic mutation frequency of 0.5% (Iqbal2024Multiomics). These mutations may affect cancer development and prognosis through interactions with co-expressed genes and proteins (Iqbal2024Multiomics).

PHLDA1 also plays a role in oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. Overexpression of PHLDA1 in cardiomyocytes leads to increased apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production, while knockdown improves cell viability and reduces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for myocardial injury (Guo2020PHLDA1).

In other cancers, PHLDA1 is overexpressed in brain, colorectal, and kidney cancers, correlating with poor prognosis, while it is downregulated in breast and liver cancers (Iqbal2024Multiomics). These findings highlight PHLDA1's complex role in cancer biology, acting as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene depending on the context.

## Interactions
PHLDA1, a member of the pleckstrin homology-like domain family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms a protein complex with phosphorylated FGFR2, particularly in the context of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, indicating a physical interaction that plays a role in regulating oxidative stress and apoptosis (Zhou2023FGF10). PHLDA1 also interacts with Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, under oxidative stress conditions, which enhances Bax levels and promotes apoptosis (Guo2020PHLDA1).

In the immune response, PHLDA1 interacts with Tollip, a negative regulator of the TLR4 signaling pathway, to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production. This interaction is crucial for modulating the TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway and reducing inflammation (Peng2022PHLDA1). In neuroblastoma cells, PHLDA1 interacts with DCAF7 and AUTS2, proteins associated with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, which are involved in neurodevelopmental gene activation and neuronal differentiation (Bugara2024Silencing).

PHLDA1 is also predicted to interact with several other proteins, including EIF3D, PLK2, and DUSP6, which are important for understanding its role in cellular processes like cell growth and division, potentially influencing cancer progression (Iqbal2024Multiomics).
