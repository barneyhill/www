# TP53TG3F

## Overview
TP53TG3F is a gene that encodes the protein TP53 target 3 family member F, which is part of a group of proteins involved in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage. The TP53TG3F gene is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, a critical player in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. The protein encoded by TP53TG3F is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. As a member of the TP53 target gene family, TP53TG3F is thought to contribute to the complex network of p53-mediated pathways that safeguard cellular integrity (Qiu2020aarFDC).
