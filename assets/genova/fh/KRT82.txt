# KRT82

## Overview
KRT82 is a gene that encodes keratin 82, a type II hair-specific keratin protein, which is integral to the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair fibers. This protein is predominantly expressed in the cuticle of the hair shaft during the anagen phase of hair growth, contributing to the formation of intermediate filaments that are essential for the cytoskeletal framework in epithelial cells (Erjavec2022Whole). Keratin 82 is characterized by its α-helical structure, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers with type I keratins, crucial for intermediate filament assembly (Zhao2024Single). The protein's interactions with other keratins, such as KRT31, KRT27, KRT35, and KRT39, underscore its role in maintaining hair strength and elasticity (Zhao2024Single). Mutations in KRT82 have been linked to hair disorders, including alopecia areata, highlighting its clinical significance in hair follicle health and disease (Erjavec2022Whole).

## Structure
The KRT82 gene encodes a type II hair-specific keratin protein, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of the hair shaft cuticle. The primary structure of KRT82 consists of a sequence of 507 amino acids, as indicated by its 1524-bp open-reading frame (Zhao2024Single). The protein's secondary structure is predominantly composed of α-helices, accounting for approximately 59.57% of its structure, with additional elements including random coils, extended strands, and β-turns (Zhao2024Single). 

The tertiary structure of KRT82 is predicted to be a helical chain, which is typical for keratin proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Zhao2024Single). These dimers are essential for the quaternary structure, where KRT82 interacts with other keratins, such as KRT31, KRT27, KRT35, and KRT39, to form intermediate filaments (Zhao2024Single). The protein lacks signal peptides and transmembrane domains, indicating its cytoplasmic localization (Zhao2024Single).

KRT82's structure includes a head domain, a 310-amino acid α-helical rod domain, and a tail domain. The rod domain is crucial for forming the coiled-coil α-helical dimer between type I and II keratins, composed of four subdomains: 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B (Erjavec2022Whole). The head domain is important for tetramer stabilization and intermediate filament assembly (Erjavec2022Whole).

## Function
KRT82, or keratin 82, is a type II hair-specific keratin gene that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair fibers. It is expressed exclusively in the cuticle of the hair shaft during the anagen phase of hair growth, which is the active growth phase of hair follicles (Erjavec2022Whole). KRT82 contributes to the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. These filaments provide a structural network that supports the mechanical strength and elasticity of hair fibers (Erjavec2022Whole).

The protein encoded by KRT82 consists of conserved domains, including a head domain, a 310-amino acid α-helical rod domain, and a tail domain. The rod domain is particularly important for forming coiled-coil α-helical dimers with type I keratins, which are necessary for the assembly of intermediate filaments (Erjavec2022Whole). In healthy human cells, KRT82 maintains the structural integrity of the hair shaft cuticle, protecting hair follicles from mechanical and environmental insults (Erjavec2022Whole). This function is critical for maintaining hair strength and preventing hair disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KRT82 gene have been implicated in several hair disorders, most notably alopecia areata (AA). AA is a complex autoimmune condition characterized by hair loss, where T-cell mediated attacks target hair follicles. Research has identified rare, damaging variants in the KRT82 gene that are significantly enriched in individuals with AA compared to controls, suggesting a strong association between these variants and the disease (Erjavec2022Whole). These variants include loss-of-function mutations and nonsynonymous coding variants that likely disrupt the structural integrity of the hair shaft cuticle, making it susceptible to autoimmune attacks (Erjavec2022Whole).

The KRT82 gene is expressed during the anagen phase of the hair follicle cycle, and its reduced expression in AA patients correlates with increased disease severity and immune infiltration (Erjavec2022Whole). The presence of rare variants in KRT82 is associated with increased CD8+ T cell infiltrates around hair follicles, indicating a compromised hair follicle structure and heightened vulnerability to autoimmune responses (Erjavec2022Whole). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KRT82 in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata.

## Interactions
KRT82, a type II hair keratin, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for the structural integrity of hair fibers. It interacts with other keratin proteins, such as KRT31, KRT27, KRT35, and KRT39, forming a network that contributes to the assembly and stability of keratin filaments (Zhao2024Single). These interactions are essential for the mechanical resilience of hair fibers, as they facilitate the formation of intermediate filaments, which are key structural components in hair and nails.

In the context of cashmere fibers, KRT82 is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes other keratins like KRT14, KRT17, and KRT10. These interactions are significant in determining fiber diameter and structural properties (Zhang2023Identification). KRT82's role in hair growth and differentiation is highlighted by its involvement in the synthesis and assembly of keratin, affecting hair diameter (Zhang2023Identification).

KRT82 is also implicated in skin and hair follicle development, interacting with genes associated with growth and development, such as BCL2, CCND1, LEF1, CTNNB1, and EGF. These interactions suggest a regulatory role in skin phenotype variation (Zhao2024Single).
