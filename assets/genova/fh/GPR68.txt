# GPR68

## Overview
GPR68, also known as OGR1, is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 68, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily recognized for its role in proton sensing, responding to changes in extracellular pH and mechanical stimuli. As a transmembrane receptor, GPR68 is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which are integral to its function in various physiological processes, including hormone secretion, immune response, and vascular health. The receptor is expressed in diverse tissues such as pancreatic islets, the intestinal tract, and blood vessels, where it contributes to cellular responses through the Gq/11-phospholipase-C/inositol-triphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway. GPR68's involvement in mechano- and chemosensory pathways underscores its significance in maintaining homeostasis and its potential implications in pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Rowe2021The; Wei2018Coincidence; Xu2018GPR68).

## Structure
GPR68, also known as OGR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in pH sensing. It typically consists of seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a characteristic feature of GPCRs (Rowe2021The). The primary structure of GPR68 includes specific amino acid sequences that form these helices, with notable residues such as a pair of Asp residues and a Glu residue that are crucial for its function in pH sensing (Rowe2021The). 

The secondary structure involves these alpha-helices and connecting loops, which contribute to the receptor's ability to sense protons and interact with divalent metal ions (Huang2020Differential). The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, which is stabilized by disulfide bonds, such as those between C13-C258 and C94-C172, playing a structural role in receptor activation (Huang2020Differential).

Post-translational modifications, including potential phosphorylation and glycosylation, may affect the receptor's function and signaling capabilities, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The context does not provide information on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of GPR68.

## Function
GPR68, also known as OGR1, is a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes by responding to changes in extracellular pH and mechanical stimuli. In healthy human cells, GPR68 is involved in mechano- and chemosensory pathways, integrating mechanical signals such as membrane stretch with chemical signals like extracellular acidification. This receptor is activated by both mechanical and chemical stimuli, leading to intracellular calcium release, which is crucial for various cellular functions (Wei2018Coincidence).

GPR68 is expressed in several tissues, including glucagon-producing cells in pancreatic islets, neuroendocrine cells of the intestinal tract, and smooth muscle layers of blood vessels. It influences processes such as hormone secretion, immune response, and bone metabolism. In the cardiovascular system, GPR68 is essential for the shear stress sensitivity of endothelial cells, contributing to flow-mediated dilation and remodeling of small arteries, which are vital for maintaining vascular health (Herzig2019Comprehensive; Xu2018GPR68).

The receptor's activation involves the Gq/11-phospholipase-C/inositol-triphosphate (IP3) pathway, leading to calcium release from intracellular stores. This mechanism is important for cellular responses to acidosis and mechanical forces, highlighting GPR68's role as a mechanosensor in vascular physiology (Herzig2019Comprehensive; Xu2018GPR68).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR68 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A gain-of-function variant, rs61745752, is associated with oncogenic phenotypes, including malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, and secondary malignant neoplasms. This variant leads to a truncation at amino acid 335, resulting in a loss of desensitization due to the absence of phosphorylation sites and the beta-arrestin binding domain, which promotes invasive cancer phenotypes (Williams2019Coupling).

GPR68 is also linked to Amelogenesis imperfecta type IIA6, a dental condition characterized by enamel hypomineralization. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in GPR68 result in early functional failure of teeth, as seen in individuals with recurrent tooth decay and multiple caries (Spedicati2021Natural).

In the context of inflammation and cancer, GPR68 is overexpressed in fibrotic intestinal regions in inflammatory bowel disease and is implicated in tumor growth and immune escape mechanisms. Its expression in non-tumor cells can promote carcinogenesis, while its deletion in mice reduces tumor development by enhancing cytotoxic CD8 T cell and macrophage function (Shore2023GPR68). GPR68's role in modulating inflammation and tumor microenvironments suggests it may influence susceptibility to chronic diseases and cancer progression (Sisignano2021ProtonSensing).

## Interactions
GPR68, also known as OGR1, is involved in various interactions that influence its function as a proton-sensing receptor. It interacts with the proton efflux machinery NHE1, modulating focal adhesions crucial for cell motility. This interaction is significant in melanoma cell migration, where GPR68 affects the formation of focal adhesions and filopodia, structures essential for cell movement (Williams2019Coupling).

GPR68 also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, which is necessary for its activation. Actin polymerization is required for GPR68 activation, and inhibitors of actin polymerization can reduce its activity. This interaction highlights the receptor's role as a coincidence detector of extracellular pH and substrate stiffness, requiring both mechanical and chemical stimuli for activation (Wei2018Coincidence).

The receptor's C-terminal tail contains phosphorylation sites and a beta-arrestin binding domain, which are crucial for desensitization through beta-arrestin recruitment. A variant of GPR68, E336X, results in the loss of these sites, affecting its interaction with beta-arrestin and leading to a gain-of-function phenotype associated with cancer progression (Williams2019Coupling). 

GPR68 can also form complexes with other receptors, such as GPR132, enhancing proton-induced calcium signaling (Insel2020ProtonSensing).
