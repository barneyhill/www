# PARD3

## Overview
PARD3 is a gene that encodes the par-3 family cell polarity regulator protein, commonly referred to as PAR3. This protein is a pivotal component of the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC complex, which plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity across various cell types, including neurons and epithelial cells. As a scaffolding protein, PAR3 is characterized by its conserved N-terminal region, three PDZ domains, and a C-terminal aPKC-binding region, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in cellular processes such as tight junction formation and neuronal polarization (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Lin2000A). The gene's significance extends to clinical contexts, where mutations and alterations in PARD3 have been linked to diseases such as cancers and neural tube defects, underscoring its role in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Chen2017Rare; Wu2024PARD3).

## Structure
The PARD3 protein, also known as PAR3, is a key component of the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC complex, which is crucial for establishing cell polarity. Its molecular structure includes a conserved N-terminal region, three PDZ domains, and a C-terminal aPKC-binding region. The N-terminal region is involved in oligomer formation and microtubule binding, while the C-terminal region interacts with aPKC, although some splice variants lack this binding capability (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Lin2000A). The PDZ domains are essential for protein-protein interactions, with PDZ1 and PDZ3 specifically binding to PAR6 (Le2022Structural; Lin2000A).

PARD3 can form stable single particles with a maximum dimension of 20 nm, and its structure is characterized by a monodisperse, moderately elongated form with a theoretical molecular weight of 141 kDa (Le2022Structural). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and function (Thompson2021Par‐3). Multiple splice variants of PARD3 exist, which may affect its structural and functional properties, with some lacking the C-terminal aPKC-binding region (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Lin2000A).

## Function
The PARD3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC complex, which is essential for establishing and maintaining cell polarity in various cell types, including neurons and epithelial cells. In neurons, PARD3 is involved in neuronal polarization, playing a significant role in axon specification and dendritic spine formation. It interacts with proteins such as TIAM1 to regulate RAC1 activation, which is crucial for proper dendritic growth and spine morphogenesis (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical).

In epithelial cells, PARD3 is vital for tight junction formation and maintenance, interacting with PAR6 and atypical PKC isoforms to form a complex that co-localizes with tight junction markers like ZO-1 at cell-cell contact areas. This interaction is necessary for maintaining the structure and function of tight junctions, which are crucial for epithelial cell polarity and tissue organization (Joberty2000The).

PARD3 also plays a role in the apical-basal polarity pathway, which is essential for neural tube closure during embryogenesis. It is involved in the asymmetric division of neural progenitor cells, influencing proper neural development (Chen2017Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PARD3 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly cancers and neural tube defects (NTDs). In liver cancer, PARD3 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor survival outcomes. This upregulation is linked to the activation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling, which maintains the stemness of tumor-initiating cells, promoting tumorigenesis and progression (Wu2024PARD3). Copy-number alterations, especially gains, are frequently observed in liver cancer, leading to increased PARD3 expression and contributing to neoplastic behavior (Wu2024PARD3).

In the context of neural tube defects, rare deleterious variants in the PARD3 gene, particularly in the aPKC-binding region, have been implicated in cranial NTDs. These variants disrupt apical tight junction formation, affecting cell polarity and contributing to the pathogenesis of these defects (Chen2017Rare). Copy number variations, such as a heterozygous microdeletion in Exon 14, have also been associated with anencephaly, a severe form of NTD, suggesting a role for PARD3 in neural tube closure (Gao2017Quantitative). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both cancer progression and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
PARD3, a key component of the PAR polarity complex, interacts with several proteins to regulate cell polarity and signaling pathways. It forms a multiprotein complex with PAR6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which is essential for establishing cell polarity in various tissues (Suzuki2001Atypical; Lin2000A). PARD3 interacts with PAR6 through its PDZ domains, facilitating the formation of a complex that also includes Cdc42, a GTPase involved in cytoskeletal organization (Joberty2000The; Lin2000A). 

PARD3's interaction with aPKC is crucial for its role in neuronal polarity, as it acts as both a substrate and inhibitor of aPKC (Lin2000A). This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal aPKC-binding region of PARD3, which is necessary for its function in neuronal polarization (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical). 

PARD3 also binds to microtubules, although this function can be inhibited by its C-terminal region (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical). Additionally, PARD3 interacts with kinesin KIF-3A, which facilitates its movement along microtubules in the axon (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical). These interactions highlight PARD3's role in maintaining cellular organization and polarity.
