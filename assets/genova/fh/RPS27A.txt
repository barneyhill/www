# RPS27A

## Overview
RPS27A is a gene that encodes a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and ribosomal protein S27a, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis and function. The ribosomal protein S27a, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, plays a pivotal role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA, particularly 18S rRNA, and is involved in protein synthesis. The ubiquitin moiety is cleaved from the fusion protein, a process essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomal subunits (Eastham2023RPS27a; Montellese2020USP16). RPS27A is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes (Son2023Antimicrobial). The protein's involvement in various cellular pathways, including the regulation of the RPL11-MDM2-p53 pathway and the PSMD12/NF-κB signaling axis, highlights its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and inflammatory responses (Li2022Loss; Li2024Modulating).

## Structure
RPS27A encodes a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and ribosomal protein S27a. The primary structure includes a ubiquitin domain followed by the ribosomal protein sequence. The ubiquitin domain spans amino acids 1-72, while the ribosomal S27 domain is located between amino acids 102-147 (Son2023Antimicrobial). The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 17.99 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.68 (Son2023Antimicrobial). 

RPS27A is produced as a linear fusion with ubiquitin at its N-terminus, which is cleaved before the ribosome reaches translation competence (Montellese2020USP16). This cleavage is crucial for the maturation and function of ribosomal subunits (Eastham2023RPS27a). The protein is part of the 40S ribosomal subunit and contains C4-type zinc finger domains, which are involved in binding directly to the 18S ribosomal RNA (Meller2024The).

Post-translational modifications include ubiquitination, specifically on lysine 113, which is counteracted by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP16. This modification is essential for the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Montellese2020USP16). The protein is highly conserved across species, with 100% homology with several fish species and 98.08% homology with mammalian species (Son2023Antimicrobial).

## Function
The RPS27A gene encodes a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and ribosomal protein S27a, which plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and function in healthy human cells. RPS27a is involved in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, a key component of the protein synthesis machinery. It is produced as a ubiquitin fusion protein, and the ubiquitin moiety is cleaved to release the ribosomal protein, a process that occurs independently of ribosome biogenesis (Eastham2023RPS27a; Montellese2020USP16).

RPS27a is primarily found in small ribosomal subunit complexes, indicating its role in ribosomal assembly (Eastham2023RPS27a). It is essential for the production of rRNA, particularly in the maturation of 18S rRNA, which is a component of the 40S subunit (Eastham2023RPS27a). The protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus, consistent with its involvement in ribosome biogenesis (Eastham2023RPS27a).

The ubiquitination of RPS27a, specifically at lysine 113, is a regulatory modification that does not lead to proteasomal degradation but is involved in the quality control of ribosome assembly. USP16, a deubiquitinating enzyme, counteracts this ubiquitination, promoting the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Montellese2020USP16).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPS27A gene have been implicated in various cancers. In cervical cancer, particularly in patients with HPV type 16, high expression levels of RPS27A are associated with poor prognosis. The gene's expression is significantly higher in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poorer outcomes in HPV16-positive patients (Wang2021High). In lung adenocarcinoma, RPS27A is involved in regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and proliferation through the RPL11-MDM2-p53 pathway. Its overexpression is linked to disease progression and poorer prognosis, while knockdown of RPS27A leads to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Li2022Loss).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RPS27A is identified as a poor prognostic predictor, with high expression levels correlating with worse overall and disease-free survival. The gene is upregulated in high-risk metastatic and recurrent tissues, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Liu2021RPS27A). In breast cancer, RPS27A is associated with lymph node commitment and metastasis risk, with mutations in the gene correlating with poor overall and relapse-free survival (Azevedo2022Comprehensive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RPS27A in cancer biology, particularly in its role in tumor progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
RPS27A is involved in several protein interactions that play critical roles in cellular processes. It is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. RPS27A interacts with ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) in lung adenocarcinoma cells, where it regulates the RPL11-MDM2-p53 pathway. This interaction is crucial for p53 activation, as RPS27A knockdown enhances the binding of RPL11 to MDM2, inhibiting MDM2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and stabilizing p53, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Li2022Loss).

In the context of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury, RPS27A modulates the PSMD12/NF-κB signaling axis. It interacts with PSMD12, which is involved in NF-κB signal transduction, promoting the secretion of inflammatory factors in microglial cells and exacerbating brain damage (Li2024Modulating). These interactions highlight RPS27A's role in immune response regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases. The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both cancer progression and inflammatory responses.
