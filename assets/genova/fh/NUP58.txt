# NUP58

## Overview
NUP58 is a gene that encodes the nucleoporin 58 protein, a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in eukaryotic cells. Nucleoporin 58 is categorized as a nucleoporin, which plays a vital role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport by facilitating the movement of ions, proteins, and RNAs between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The protein is part of the Nup62 complex, which also includes Nup54 and Nup62, and is essential for maintaining the permeability barrier of the NPC. Structurally, nucleoporin 58 features an antiparallel hairpin with alpha helices that enable tetrameric assembly, contributing to the dynamic flexibility of the NPC (Melčák2007Structure). NUP58 is also involved in cell division, localizing to centrosomes and midbodies during mitosis, and its dysfunction is linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis (Hartono2019Nucleoporin; Roy2019Oncogenic).

## Structure
NUP58 is a nucleoporin that forms part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), specifically within the Nup62 complex. The protein structure of NUP58 includes a core domain composed of residues 327 to 415, which forms an antiparallel hairpin structure with two alpha helices connected by a loop. This structure is crucial for the formation of tetrameric assemblies through dimerization of identical dimers in a 'head-to-head' orientation, with the N helices forming the tetramerization interface (Melčák2007Structure).

NUP58 can form amyloid aggregates, both in vitro and in vivo, with amyloidogenic regions identified between amino acids 146 and 213. These regions do not overlap with the coiled-coil domains necessary for protein interactions within the NPC subcomplexes (Danilov2021The). The protein's ability to form amyloids is linked to its oligomeric and polymeric states, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds (Danilov2021The).

NUP58 also exists in alternatively spliced forms, such as Nup45, which differ in their unstructured regions (Melčák2007Structure). These structural features contribute to the flexibility of the NPC's diameter, allowing for dynamic adjustments in the nuclear pore's size (Melčák2007Structure).

## Function
NUP58 is a nucleoporin that is an integral component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is essential for the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport in human cells. It plays a critical role in the transport of ions, proteins, and RNAs between the nucleus and cytoplasm by interacting with transport receptors known as karyopherins (Kaps) (1 page 5 of 15; 1 page 11 of 15). NUP58 forms a complex with NUP54 and NUP62, anchored to the pore by NUP93, and is involved in maintaining the permeability barrier of the NPC (1 page 5 of 15). The protein contains FG domains at both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, which are crucial for its interactions with transport receptors and for facilitating molecular trafficking through the nuclear pore channel (1 page 5 of 15).

In addition to its role in transport, NUP58 is involved in cell division processes, localizing to centrosomes and midbodies during mitosis. Its depletion is associated with defective cytokinesis and delayed mitosis, highlighting its importance in cell cycle progression (1 page 5 of 15). NUP58 is also implicated in maintaining the proper assembly and functionality of the NPC, and its disruption can lead to changes in the expression of other NPC components and nuclear transport proteins (1 page 11 of 15).

## Clinical Significance
NUP58 has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. In colorectal cancer cell lines, NUP58 is highly expressed, and RNA interference targeting NUP58 has been shown to decrease cell viability, suggesting its role in cancer cell survival and proliferation (1 page 5 of 15). In lung adenocarcinoma, NUP58 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis through the GSK-3β-Snail signaling axis, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer (Roy2019Oncogenic).

Mutations in NUP58 can lead to decreased cellular fitness and impaired nuclear import, as observed in studies using CRISPR-Cas9 to create hypomorphic alleles. These mutations result in truncated protein isoforms and reduced mRNA levels, affecting cell growth and function (1 page 10 of 15, 1 page 13 of 15). Despite these impairments, cells can adapt through mechanisms such as exon skipping and gene amplification, which partially restore function and cellular fitness (1 page 14 of 15, 1 page 12 of 15).

The adaptive evolution of cells to NUP58 mutations highlights the gene's essential role in cellular processes and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer (1 page 11 of 15, 1 page 9 of 15).

## Interactions
NUP58 is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and interacts with other nucleoporins, forming a critical subcomplex for NPC function. It is part of the Nup62 complex, which includes Nup62, Nup54, and Nup58 itself. This complex is essential for the assembly and function of the NPC, with a stoichiometry of 1:1:1, and is located at the center of the NPC, connecting to the NPC scaffold through coiled-coil interactions with Nup93 (Ulrich2014The). Nup54 acts as a bridge between Nup62 and Nup58, facilitating their interaction, as Nup58 and Nup62 do not form a stable complex on their own (Ulrich2014The).

During mitosis, Nup58 localizes to centrosomes and midbodies, suggesting interactions with centrosomal proteins such as γ-tubulin and SAS-6, although it does not interact with ninein (Hartono2019Nucleoporin). Nup58 is also implicated in forming a potential subcomplex with Nup62 and Nup54, which may be crucial for cytokinesis (Hartono2019Nucleoporin). The protein's interactions are dynamic, contributing to the structural variability of the NPC, potentially through a sliding mechanism that adjusts the transport channel's diameter (Melčák2007Structure).
