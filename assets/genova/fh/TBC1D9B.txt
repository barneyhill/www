# TBC1D9B

## Overview
TBC1D9B is a gene that encodes the TBC1 domain family member 9B protein, which is a member of the TBC family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). This protein plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular trafficking and autophagic flux, processes essential for cellular homeostasis and the degradation and recycling of cellular components. TBC1D9B contains several functional domains, including GRAM, TBC, and EF-HAND domains, which facilitate its interaction with small GTPases such as RAB11A and autophagy-related proteins like LC3B. Through these interactions, TBC1D9B modulates the maturation and trafficking of autophagosomes to lysosomes, thereby influencing autophagic processes. The gene's involvement in these critical cellular functions has implications for various neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nozawa2020TBC1D9; Liao2018Interaction; Frolov2024Two).

## Structure
The TBC1D9B protein is a member of the TBC family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) and is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking. It contains several distinct domains, including two GRAM domains, one TBC domain, and one EF-HAND domain, which are crucial for its function (Nozawa2020TBC1D9; Liao2018Interaction). The TBC domain is approximately 200 amino acids long and is associated with GAP activity for small GTPase RAB proteins, such as RAB11A (Liao2018Interaction).

A specific region within TBC1D9B, termed the ATG8 interaction domain (AID), is located in the C-terminal fragment between amino acids 1112-1250. This region is essential for interaction with ATG8 homologues like LC3B, GABARAP, and GATE-16 (Liao2018Interaction). The AID can be further trimmed to a 97 amino acid fragment that retains binding capability, featuring two clusters of amino acids (SSYS and QCED) necessary for interaction (Liao2018Interaction).

TBC1D9B has two splicing variants: the alpha form and the beta form. The beta form is 17 amino acids shorter, missing the sequence from amino acids 954 to 971, yet both forms retain the functional domains necessary for interaction with LC3B (Liao2018Interaction).

## Function
TBC1D9B is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that plays a significant role in regulating autophagic flux, a crucial cellular process for maintaining homeostasis by degrading and recycling cellular components. It interacts with mammalian ATG8 homologues, such as LC3B, which are essential for autophagosome formation and expansion. This interaction is vital for the proper trafficking of autophagosomes to lysosomes, ensuring efficient degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles (Liao2018Interaction).

TBC1D9B is recruited to autophagosomes through its interaction with LC3B, promoting autophagic flux by inactivating RAB11A, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking. This inactivation prevents mis-trafficking of autophagosomes, facilitating their maturation and fusion with lysosomes (Liao2018Interaction). The protein is diffusely expressed in the cytosol, with a concentration in the peri-nuclear region, and colocalizes with LC3B puncta under starvation conditions, indicating its active role in autophagy (Liao2018Interaction).

TBC1D9B's function in autophagy is supported by its effect on LC3-II turnover and the degradation of long-lived proteins, with knockdown of TBC1D9B inhibiting these processes and overexpression enhancing them (Liao2018Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
The TBC1D9B gene has been implicated in various neurological disorders due to its role in mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy. Mutations in TBC1D9B may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases by affecting mitochondrial function and autophagy processes (Frolov2024Two). Alterations in the expression levels of TBC1D9B have also been observed in melanoma, where its mRNA expression varies significantly between melanoma cases and normal tissues. These differences in expression levels are associated with clinical stages of melanoma, suggesting that TBC1D9B could serve as a prognostic marker for this type of cancer (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16).

While the specific clinical implications of TBC1D9B mutations are not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in critical cellular processes like autophagy and mitochondrial regulation indicates that disruptions could have significant impacts on disease development and progression. The potential link between TBC1D9B and these diseases highlights the importance of further research to understand its role in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TBC1D9B interacts with several mammalian ATG8 homologues, including LC3B, GATE-16, GABARAP, and ATG8L, which are crucial for regulating autophagic flux. The interaction with LC3B is mediated by a specific region in TBC1D9B known as the ATG8 interaction domain (AID). This domain can be further reduced to a 97 amino acid fragment (R7) that retains binding capability, relying on two clusters of amino acids for interaction rather than the typical LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif (Liao2018Interaction). TBC1D9B's interaction with LC3B and other homologues was confirmed through various assays, including yeast two-hybrid, GST pulldown, and co-immunoprecipitation, both in vitro and in vivo (Liao2018Interaction).

TBC1D9B also acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAB11A, a small GTPase involved in autophagosome formation and maturation. This interaction helps prevent mis-trafficking by inactivating RAB11A, promoting autophagic flux and degradation (Liao2018Interaction). The recruitment of TBC1D9B to autophagosomes is facilitated by its interaction with LC3, allowing it to inactivate RAB11A and facilitate the proper trafficking of autophagosomes to the lysosomal compartment for degradation (Liao2018Interaction).
