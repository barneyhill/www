# ILF2

## Overview
Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (ILF2) is a gene that encodes the ILF2 protein, also known as NF45, which is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. The ILF2 protein is characterized by its role in RNA processing and gene regulation, functioning primarily as a part of a heterodimeric complex with ILF3 (NF90/NF110). This complex is essential for modulating RNA stability and gene expression, particularly in response to cellular stimuli. ILF2 is involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, and the immune response, notably enhancing the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene in T-cells (Zhao2005NF45ILF2). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is expressed in various tissues, including the testes, brain, and kidney (Zhao2005NF45ILF2). ILF2's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its implication in pathological conditions, such as cancer, where it acts as a proto-oncogene (NoblejasLópez2021Genomic; Li2019ILF2).

## Structure
The ILF2 protein, also known as NF45, is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function in RNA processing and gene regulation. The primary structure of ILF2 consists of 390 amino acids (Lian2020Cereblon). It contains an amino-terminal RGG-rich single-stranded RNA-binding domain and a zinc-finger nucleic acid binding domain (DZF), which are conserved across species (Cui2011Cloning; Zhao2005NF45ILF2). These domains are crucial for its role in binding RNA and DNA.

ILF2 forms a heterodimeric complex with ILF3, also known as NF90, which is essential for its quaternary structure and function. This complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to double-stranded DNA and viral RNA (Lian2020Cereblon; Zhao2005NF45ILF2). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Cui2011Cloning).

ILF2 is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it undergoes ubiquitination, particularly at key residues such as K45, which is critical for its degradation (Lian2020Cereblon). This modification is mediated by Cereblon, a substrate receptor of the cullin-RING E3 ligase complex (Lian2020Cereblon).

## Function
ILF2, also known as NF45, is a multifunctional protein involved in various aspects of RNA processing and gene regulation in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in transcription, splicing, export, and translation of RNA. ILF2 forms a heterodimer with NF90/ILF3, which is crucial for its function in the nucleus, where it associates with chromatin at active promoters and enhancers (Wu2019Inducible; Zhao2005NF45ILF2). This complex is involved in the regulation of immediate early genes, which are rapidly expressed in response to stimuli and are important for processes such as inflammation and cell proliferation (Wu2019Inducible).

ILF2 is also implicated in the regulation of the IL-2 gene, enhancing its transcriptional activation in T-cells, which is vital for immune response regulation (Zhao2005NF45ILF2). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, with significant expression in tissues such as the testes, brain, and kidney, indicating its role in nuclear functions (Zhao2005NF45ILF2). ILF2 is essential for cell viability and apoptosis regulation, as it modulates the expression of apoptosis-related genes, thereby influencing cell survival and proliferation (Wei2020Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
ILF2 (interleukin enhancer binding factor 2) is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a proto-oncogene. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ILF2 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes anchorage independence by directly regulating the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which is involved in apoptosis and cell adhesion. This regulation may contribute to tumor development and metastasis (Li2019ILF2). In luminal breast cancer, ILF2, along with LSM1 and CLNS1A, is amplified and linked to poor overall survival. Downregulation of ILF2 in luminal breast cancer cell lines results in reduced cell growth and proliferation, highlighting its prognostic significance (NoblejasLópez2021Genomic).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ILF2 is highly expressed and influences metabolic pathways, potentially playing a role in cancer progression through the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acid metabolism (Zang2021Metabolomic). In multiple myeloma, ILF2 overexpression is associated with increased genomic instability tolerance, enhancing cell survival and drug resistance, particularly in patients with 1q21 amplification (Burroughs2021Role). ILF2 also interacts with long non-coding RNAs like H19 in breast cancer, affecting DNA damage response and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Zhao2023LncRNA).

## Interactions
ILF2, also known as NF45, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. ILF2 forms a complex with ILF3 (NF90/NF110), which is crucial for modulating the stability of RNA duplexes, such as the ELF3-AS1/ELF3 RNA duplex, particularly affecting the ELF3-201 transcript. This interaction is specific to the first exon region of ELF3-AS1 and is necessary for binding with the ILF2/ILF3 complex (Li2022LncRNA).

In multiple myeloma cells, ILF2 interacts with the APOBEC3B (A3B) protein, enhancing its cytidine deaminase activity. This interaction is RNA-dependent and occurs within high-molecular-mass ribonucleoprotein complexes, indicating ILF2's role in regulating A3B's function (Kazuma2022ILF2).

ILF2 also binds with NUSAP1 in prostate cancer cells, modulating R-loop accumulation and DNA damage. This interaction is crucial for the DNA damage response, as depletion of ILF2 increases R-loop formation and DNA damage, which can be mitigated by NUSAP1 depletion (Chiu2023NUSAP1).

Additionally, ILF2 interacts with circ_406961 in human bronchial epithelial cells, affecting the STAT3 and JNK signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses (Jia2020Circular).
