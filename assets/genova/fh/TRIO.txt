# TRIO

## Overview
The TRIO gene encodes the trio Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the TRIO protein is involved in the activation of Rho family GTPases, including Rac1, RhoG, and RhoA, which are essential for processes such as cell morphology, migration, and adhesion (Debant1996The; Kempers2021The). The protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring multiple domains such as two GEF domains, a serine/threonine kinase domain, and spectrin-like repeats, which facilitate its diverse interactions and functions (Debant1996The; Kratzer2019Evolution). TRIO is expressed in various cell types, including neurons and endothelial cells, where it influences critical biological processes like axon guidance and vascular integrity (Kempers2021The; Bateman2001The). Mutations in the TRIO gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function and development (Barbosa2020Opposite; Katrancha2019Trio).

## Structure
The TRIO protein is a multidomain protein characterized by its complex structure, which includes several distinct regions with specific functions. It contains two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains, each associated with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The N-terminal GEF domain (GEF1) is specific for Rac1 and RhoG, while the C-terminal GEF domain (GEF2) specifically activates RhoA (Debant1996The; Kratzer2019Evolution). The PH domains play crucial roles in protein-protein interactions and enhance the efficiency of guanine nucleotide exchange (Chhatriwala2007The).

TRIO also includes a serine/threonine kinase (STK) domain, similar to calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases, and an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain (Debant1996The). The protein's structure is further organized with four spectrin-like domains at the N-terminal, which may be involved in intracellular targeting (Debant1996The). 

The TRIO protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation on serine residues, and is known to form complexes with other proteins like the LAR transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase (Debant1996The). TRIO also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Kratzer2019Evolution). These structural features enable TRIO to play a significant role in cellular signaling and actin cytoskeleton regulation.

## Function
The TRIO gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho family GTPases, including Rac1, RhoG, and RhoA. These GTPases are crucial for actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which affects cell morphology, migration, and adhesion (Maier2018The; Kempers2021The). In glomerular podocytes, TRIO is involved in maintaining cell size and structure by activating Rac1, which is essential for podocyte function and attachment to the glomerular basement membrane (Maier2018The). TRIO's role in activating Rac1 is also significant in the context of endothelial cells, where it stabilizes adherens junctions and maintains vascular barrier integrity (Kempers2021The).

TRIO contains two GEF domains that activate different GTPases: the N-terminal GEF1 domain primarily activates Rac1 and RhoG, while the C-terminal GEF2 domain activates RhoA. This dual activation allows TRIO to balance cell spreading and contraction, which is vital for cell migration and morphology (Kempers2021The; Bateman2001The). TRIO is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial cells and neurons, where it influences processes such as angiogenesis and axon guidance (Kempers2021The; Bateman2001The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIO gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These mutations often occur in two main domains: the seventh spectrin repeat and the RAC1-activating GEFD1 domain. Mutations in the spectrin repeat domain are linked to severe intellectual disability and macrocephaly, characterized by an abnormally large head size, due to hyperactivation of RAC1 signaling (Barbosa2020Opposite). In contrast, mutations in the GEFD1 domain are associated with milder intellectual disability and microcephaly, a condition marked by reduced head size, resulting from impaired RAC1 activation (Barbosa2020Opposite).

TRIO haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient, has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. This condition can lead to deficits in brain structure, synaptic function, and behaviors, including motor coordination and social interaction (Katrancha2019Trio). The TRIO gene's role in synaptic transmission and plasticity is crucial, and its mutations can disrupt normal neuronal connectivity and function, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Sadybekov2017An; Katrancha2019Trio).

## Interactions
The TRIO protein, a Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. TRIO interacts with the Gαq/11 subunits, which activate TRIO by relieving its autoinhibitory constraint, leading to the activation of RhoA (Bandekar2019Structure). In Drosophila, TRIO physically interacts with the netrin receptor Frazzled (Fra) and the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl), forming a multiprotein complex involved in axon guidance signaling pathways (Forsthoefel2005The). The SH3 domain of TRIO is crucial for its interaction with Abl, while its spectrin-like repeats are not necessary for interaction with Fra or Abl (Forsthoefel2005The).

TRIO also interacts with presynaptic active zone proteins Piccolo and Bassoon, which are important for its localization to synapses and its role in synaptic function (TerryLorenzo2016Trio). The N-terminal spectrin repeats of TRIO are essential for its stable association with these proteins (TerryLorenzo2016Trio). Additionally, TRIO interacts with the scaffolding protein Kidins220, which is crucial for Rac1 activation and neurite outgrowth (Neubrand2010Kidins220ARMS). These interactions highlight TRIO's role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling.
