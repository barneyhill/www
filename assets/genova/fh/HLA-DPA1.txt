# HLA-DPA1

## Overview
The HLA-DPA1 gene encodes the alpha chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, DP alpha 1 protein, which is a critical component of the immune system. This protein is primarily involved in antigen presentation, where it forms a heterodimer with the beta chain encoded by the HLA-DPB1 gene. The heterodimer is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and plays a pivotal role in presenting extracellular protein-derived peptides to CD4+ T cells, thereby initiating immune responses (O’Brien2011Risk; Lauterbach2014Allorecognition). The HLA-DPA1 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its structure, which includes an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition). The gene exhibits polymorphism, particularly in exon 2, which affects peptide binding and T cell recognition, influencing immune responses and disease susceptibility (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition).

## Structure
The HLA-DPA1 gene encodes the alpha chain of the HLA-DP heterodimer, a class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The protein structure includes an extracellular domain composed of α1 and α2 domains, which are involved in forming the peptide-binding groove. This groove is created by the folding of the α1 and β1 domains, which are distal from the cell surface (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition). The α2 domain, along with the β2 domain of the beta chain, is proximal to the cell membrane and resembles an immunoglobulin C domain. The alpha chain is anchored to the cell membrane and includes a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition).

The HLA-DPA1 protein is less polymorphic compared to its beta chain counterpart, with significant polymorphism located in exon 2, which encodes part of the peptide-binding region (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is common among MHC class II molecules. The quaternary structure of HLA-DPA1 involves its association with the beta chain encoded by the DPB1 gene to form the functional heterodimer, which is crucial for antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells (Hollenbach2012A).

## Function
HLA-DPA1 encodes the alpha chain of the HLA-DP molecule, a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. This protein plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting extracellular protein-derived peptides to CD4+ T cells. The interaction between HLA-DP molecules and CD4+ T cells is essential for initiating immune responses and maintaining immune surveillance (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition). HLA-DPA1 is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it forms heterodimers with the beta chain encoded by the HLA-DPB1 gene (O’Brien2011Risk).

The polymorphism in the HLA-DPA1 gene influences the peptide binding affinity and T cell recognition, which can affect immune responses. Specific polymorphic residues in the alpha chain, such as those at position 31, are likely to impact T cell receptor (TCR) interaction or peptide binding, thereby influencing T cell alloreactivity (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition). This polymorphism is significant in contexts such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, where it can affect patient outcomes by influencing the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other post-transplantation complications (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition).

## Clinical Significance
The HLA-DPA1 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune response and antigen presentation. Variations in this gene have been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9277336, is linked to disease severity. The minor allele of this SNP is associated with decreased hospitalizations and improved cardiac output in PAH patients, suggesting a protective role (Hafeez2023Single).

In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), genetic polymorphisms in the HLA-DPA1 region contribute to disease susceptibility, independent of the well-known HLA-B27 association. Specific alleles and haplotypes in the HLA-DPA1 region have shown significant associations with AS (Díaz‐Peña2011Fine).

HLA-DPA1 is also linked to chronic hepatitis B infection. The SNP rs3077 in the HLA-DPA1 gene is associated with a decreased risk of chronic HBV infection and is a predictor for HBV clearance in the Han Chinese population (An2011A).

In multiple myeloma, down-regulated expression of HLA-DPA1 is associated with shorter disease-specific survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Yang2020HLADPA1).

Alterations in HLA-DPA1 expression have also been linked to an increased risk of anembryonic pregnancy, with specific SNPs like rs1431403 associated with this condition (Wang2019Relationship).

## Interactions
HLA-DPA1 is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in the immune system. It forms a heterodimer with HLA-DPB1, which is essential for presenting antigens to CD4+ T cells. This interaction is a key component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, facilitating immune responses by presenting processed antigens to T-helper cells (Lauterbach2014Allorecognition).

In the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), HLA-DPA1 interacts with nuclear alpha actinin 4 (ACTN4). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9277336, located near the HLA-DPA1 gene, shows allele-specific binding to ACTN4. This interaction influences the expression of HLA-DPA1 and is implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell function and PAH pathogenesis. The binding of ACTN4 to the A allele of SNP rs9277336 is stronger compared to the G allele, leading to increased transcriptional activity and affecting endothelial pathophenotypes in PAH (Hafeez2023Single).

HLA-DPA1 is also identified as a hub gene in a protein-protein interaction network related to NRAS-mutant skin cutaneous melanoma. Its expression levels are associated with overall survival in patients, indicating its potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Dodin2023Illuminating).
