# AFTPH

## Overview
AFTPH is a gene that encodes the protein aftiphilin, which plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking processes. Aftiphilin is characterized as a clathrin-associated protein, involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, and is crucial for the trafficking and recycling of membrane proteins, such as neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1), within cells (Hirst2005The; Law2016Neurotensininduced). The protein is predominantly localized in the trans-Golgi network and early endosomes, where it interacts with various proteins, including adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) and clathrin, to facilitate endocytosis and exocytosis (Law2016Neurotensininduced; Zhu2020Expression). Aftiphilin's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways, with implications in cancer biology and inflammatory responses (Law2016Neurotensininduced; Zhu2020Expression).

## Structure
Aftiphilin is a protein encoded by the AFTPH gene, involved in intracellular trafficking processes. The primary structure of aftiphilin consists of 937 amino acids, as identified through cDNA sequencing (Hirst2005The). The protein contains multiple γ ear binding motifs and a clathrin box within a 28-amino acid insert, which are crucial for its interactions with AP-1 and clathrin (Hirst2005The). A second clathrin-binding site, marked by the YQW motif, is located upstream of the clathrin box (Hirst2005The).

Aftiphilin is predicted to have a largely disordered structure, which is typical for proteins with long regions of little secondary structure (Hirst2005The). This disordered nature contributes to its sensitivity to proteolysis (Hirst2005The). The protein forms a stable complex with p200 and γ-synergin, indicating a quaternary structure that is essential for its function in clathrin-coated vesicle formation (Hirst2005The). The presence of splice variants in mammals suggests functional diversity, with one variant including the clathrin box (Hirst2005The). The exact details of its tertiary structure remain speculative, as the complete molecular structure has not been fully elucidated (Hirst2005The).

## Function
AFTPH (aftiphilin) is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the context of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) recycling in human colonic epithelial cells. It is a downstream target of miR-133α, which is regulated by neurotensin signaling. AFTPH plays a crucial role in the trafficking of NTR1 from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, facilitating the receptor's rapid recycling back to the plasma membrane. This process is essential for cell desensitization and re-sensitization to ligand stimuli, impacting cellular signaling pathways (Law2016Neurotensininduced).

AFTPH is localized in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes, where it is involved in the intracellular transport processes. Overexpression of AFTPH has been shown to reduce the trafficking of NTR1 to the plasma membrane after neurotensin exposure, suggesting its role in retaining NTR1 in the cytosol (Law2016Neurotensininduced). AFTPH is also associated with clathrin-coated vesicles, indicating its involvement in endocytosis and vesicle formation (Law2016Neurotensininduced).

The protein's activity in the TGN and early endosomes suggests its involvement in the regulation of protein trafficking and recycling, potentially affecting cellular signaling pathways such as MAPK and NF-κB (Law2016Neurotensininduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AFTPH gene have been linked to various cancers. In breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), AFTPH is often overexpressed compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting that AFTPH may function as an oncogene in these cancers (Zhu2020Expression). However, in specific subgroups, such as male PAAD and black BRCA patients, high AFTPH expression appears to be protective (Zhu2020Expression).

The AFTPH gene is also involved in the regulation of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) recycling in human colonic epithelial cells. This process is mediated by the miR-133α/AFTPH axis, which affects intracellular trafficking pathways. Dysregulation of this axis can influence proinflammatory responses and may contribute to colonic inflammation and early cancer development (Law2016Neurotensininduced).

While genetic alterations such as gene copy number gains and amplification of AFTPH are common in these cancers, they are not significantly associated with prognostic outcomes (Zhu2020Expression). The role of AFTPH in cancer progression highlights its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
AFTPH (aftiphilin) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. AFTPH interacts with the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), where it colocalizes and potentially regulates MLCK activity. This interaction is significant for maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function by influencing actin dynamics and myosin light chain phosphorylation (Law2022Aftiphilin).

AFTPH is also associated with the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. It interacts with the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) and clathrin, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is important for endosomal trafficking and exocytosis, as AFTPH binds to the γ-adaptin ear domain of AP-1, contributing to the trans-Golgi network and endosomal clathrin coats (Selheim2024Monocytic; Zhu2020Expression).

Additionally, AFTPH is a downstream target of miR-133α, which regulates its expression. This interaction is part of a regulatory network involving neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) trafficking, where miR-133α modulates AFTPH levels, affecting NTR1 recycling and intracellular trafficking (Law2014Neurotensin—regulated; Law2016Neurotensininduced).
