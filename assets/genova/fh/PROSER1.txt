# PROSER1

## Overview
PROSER1 is a gene that encodes the protein proline and serine rich 1, which plays a significant role in the regulation of DNA demethylation processes. This protein is involved in chromatin-associated functions and interacts with TET proteins, particularly TET2, to influence DNA methylation patterns at enhancers and CpG islands. The protein is a key component of multiprotein complexes, such as the TOPD complexes, which are essential for maintaining proper gene expression and genomic stability. PROSER1's interactions with other proteins, including OGT, PSPC1, and NONO, facilitate the O-GlcNAcylation of TET2, enhancing its stability and function. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in human health (Wang2021PROSER1; Blakes2024Regional; Fleming2024PROSER1).

## Function
The PROSER1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA demethylation processes in healthy human cells. It interacts with TET proteins, particularly TET2, to facilitate the recruitment of these enzymes to chromatin, thereby influencing DNA methylation patterns at enhancers and CpG islands. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper gene expression and preventing widespread DNA hypomethylation, which can lead to developmental malformations (Wang2021PROSER1; Fleming2024PROSER1).

PROSER1 is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes, such as the TOPD complexes, which include TET proteins, OGT, PSPC1, and NONO. These complexes are crucial for chromatin-associated processes and the regulation of DNA demethylation (Fleming2024PROSER1). The protein also mediates the O-GlcNAcylation of TET2, a modification that stabilizes TET2 at genomic regions, enhancing its recruitment and function in DNA demethylation (Wang2021PROSER1).

In the absence of PROSER1, there is an increase in DNA methylation at specific sites, leading to gene repression and potential developmental defects. This highlights its role in maintaining genomic stability and proper gene regulation during early development (Wang2021PROSER1; Fleming2024PROSER1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PROSER1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of cancer, PROSER1 is implicated in the regulation of DNA methylation, and its loss can lead to DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, which is observed in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This suggests a potential tumor-protective role for PROSER1 by preventing DNA methylation and gene silencing at certain genomic elements (Wang2021PROSER1).

In neurodevelopment, mutations in PROSER1 are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hypotonia, developmental delays, genitourinary malformations, craniofacial abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss, and strabismus. Mouse models with PROSER1 knockout exhibit increased pre-weaning lethality and developmental disabilities, indicating that PROSER1 is crucial for proper neurodevelopment (Fleming2024PROSER1).

Additionally, PROSER1 has been identified as a gene with strong nonsense constraint in NMD-target regions, suggesting its functional importance in preventing severe genetic disorders. This constraint indicates that mutations in these regions could lead to significant clinical consequences (Blakes2024Regional). In medulloblastoma, higher expression levels of PROSER1 are associated with worse overall survival, highlighting its potential role in cancer prognosis (Lian2019Integrative).

## Interactions
PROSER1 is known to interact with multiple proteins, forming complexes that play a crucial role in DNA demethylation and chromatin regulation. It acts as a pan-TET interactor, engaging with TET1, TET2, and TET3 enzymes in mouse embryonic stem cells and embryoid bodies. These interactions are part of distinct complexes known as TOPD (TET-OGT-PROSER1-DBHS proteins) complexes, which also include proteins like OGT, PSPC1, and NONO. Notably, TET2's presence in these complexes is mutually exclusive with TET1 and TET3, indicating that PROSER1 forms separate complexes with each TET enzyme (Fleming2024PROSER1).

PROSER1 also mediates the interaction between TET2 and OGT, promoting TET2 O-GlcNAcylation, which is crucial for TET2's stability and function at enhancers and CpG islands. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of MLL3/4 complexes, which are involved in chromatin signaling (Wang2021PROSER1). Additionally, PROSER1 is associated with UTX, a component of the MLL3/4 complexes, and influences the chromatin association of TET1/2, impacting DNA demethylation at UTX/H3K4me1-dependent enhancers and CpG islands (Wang2021PROSER1). These interactions highlight PROSER1's role in regulating chromatin-associated proteins and maintaining DNA methylation patterns.
