# NEIL3

## Overview
The NEIL3 gene encodes the nei like DNA glycosylase 3 protein, a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining genomic stability. As a DNA glycosylase, NEIL3 is particularly adept at recognizing and excising damaged bases in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), such as those found at replication forks and in G-quadruplex structures. The protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a Ran binding protein-type zinc finger motif and duplicated GRF-zinc finger motifs, which contribute to its specificity and function in DNA repair (Liu2013Structural). NEIL3 is expressed predominantly in proliferating cells and plays a significant role in neural progenitor cells, where it is essential for adult neurogenesis and cognitive functions (Regnell2012Hippocampal). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated, with implications for cancer progression and autoimmune diseases when dysregulated (Chen2022Biological; Massaad2016Deficiency).

## Structure
The NEIL3 protein is a DNA glycosylase involved in the base excision repair pathway, with a marked preference for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) due to its unique structural features. It is larger than other members of the Fpg/Nei family and includes a Ran binding protein-type zinc finger motif and a duplicated GRF-zinc finger motif at its extended C terminus (Liu2013Structural). The NEIL3 protein contains several domains, including a catalytic NEI domain and zinc finger domains (NZF and GRF1/GRF2). The NEI domain is responsible for DNA glycosylase activity, crucial for the repair of abasic site interstrand cross-links (Ap-ICLs) (Huskova2022Model).

The NEI domain consists of two subdomains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD contains catalytic residues and is characterized by eight anti-parallel beta-sheets forming a sandwich structure, flanked by helices and a flexible loop. The CTD includes four helices and a zinc finger with two antiparallel beta-sheets (Huskova2022Model). The GRF domains, which form a dimer resembling a butterfly shape, bind ssDNA with greater affinity than individual domains (Huskova2022Model). NEIL3's structure and function are crucial for understanding its role in DNA repair, particularly in the context of genomic stability (Huskova2022Model).

## Function
The NEIL3 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase that plays a crucial role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for repairing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining genomic stability. NEIL3 is particularly active in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions, such as those found at replication forks and in G-quadruplex structures, where it repairs oxidative lesions like spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) and guanidinohydantoin (Gh) (Chen2022Biological). 

NEIL3 is expressed in proliferating cells, including stem-cell-rich regions of the brain, and its expression decreases with age (Chen2022Biological). It is recruited to telomeres during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it interacts with TRF1, a component of the Shelterin complex, to enhance its glycosylase activity and facilitate the repair of telomeric DNA damage (Chen2022Biological). 

In neural progenitor cells, NEIL3 is vital for maintaining adult neurogenesis by repairing oxidative DNA lesions, which is crucial for cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Regnell2012Hippocampal). NEIL3 also plays a role in the repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs), preventing chromosomal rearrangements and maintaining genomic integrity (Chen2022Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NEIL3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and autoimmune conditions. In cancer, NEIL3 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. It is notably overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme, breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and kidney cancers, where it is associated with poorer overall survival (Chen2022Biological). In liver cancer, NEIL3 overexpression correlates with higher tumor grades and poorer survival rates, and its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and invasion (Chen2022Biological; Wang2021NEIL3). NEIL3 also plays a role in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and growth (Wang2021NEIL3).

In autoimmune conditions, a homozygous missense mutation in NEIL3, specifically D132V, has been linked to increased predisposition to autoimmunity. This mutation impairs the glycosylase activity of NEIL3, leading to defective peripheral B cell tolerance and impaired regulatory T cell function, which are associated with elevated autoantibody levels and severe autoimmune symptoms (Massaad2016Deficiency). This mutation highlights the role of NEIL3 in maintaining immune system balance and preventing autoimmunity.

## Interactions
NEIL3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA repair processes. It localizes to telomeres through its interaction with the telomeric repeat factor TRF1, which is essential for its function in repairing oxidative damage in telomeric sequences during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle (Zhou2017NEIL3). NEIL3 also interacts with proteins involved in long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER), which is critical for its role in telomere repair (Zhou2017NEIL3).

NEIL3 is recruited to sites of psoralen-induced interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in a PARP-dependent manner, particularly involving PARP1. It interacts with the RUVBL1/2 complex, which stabilizes NEIL3 and functions in the same pathway for psoralen-ICL repair (Li2020Cooperation). NEIL3 also interacts with TRAIP, a master regulator of psoralen-ICL repair, although TRAIP functions upstream of NEIL3 (Li2020Cooperation).

The Zf-GRF motifs of NEIL3 interact with APE1 and PCNA, regulating APE1 endonuclease activity on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and maintaining ssDNA stability (Ha2020A). These motifs do not affect APE1 activity on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but inhibit its activity on ssDNA, suggesting a protective role against ssDNA damage (Ha2020A).
