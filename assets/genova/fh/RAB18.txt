# RAB18

## Overview
RAB18 is a gene that encodes a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are part of the Ras superfamily. The protein product, RAB18, is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle transport, lipid metabolism, and autophagy. As a small GTPase, RAB18 functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active and inactive states to regulate intracellular trafficking and organelle dynamics. It is particularly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, where it plays a crucial role in lipid droplet formation and lipolysis. RAB18's activity is modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), with Rab3GAP acting as a specific GEF. Mutations in the RAB18 gene are linked to Warburg Micro syndrome, a severe developmental disorder, underscoring its importance in human health and development (Dejgaard2019Rab18; Wu2016RAB18).

## Structure
Rab18 is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are part of the Ras superfamily. The primary structure of Rab18 includes a hypervariable C-terminal domain with a CAAX motif, indicating it undergoes monoprenylation, a post-translational modification essential for membrane association (VázquezMartínez2011Rab). This modification involves the addition of a geranylgeranyl group, which facilitates its attachment to cellular membranes (Bhuin2014Rab).

The tertiary structure of Rab18, like other Rab GTPases, consists of a central barrel composed of six β-sheets surrounded by five α-helices. This structure is crucial for its function as it includes conserved regions such as the GTP-binding platform and Mg2+ binding site (VázquezMartínez2011Rab). Rab18's structure allows it to cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, a process regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (Dejgaard2019Rab18:).

Rab18 is associated with various organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, and plays a role in lipid droplet dynamics by interacting with proteins like PLIN2 and ACSL3 (Deng2020Rab18). The protein's localization and function are influenced by its interactions and post-translational modifications.

## Function
RAB18 is a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle transport, lipid metabolism, and autophagy. In healthy human cells, RAB18 is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets, playing a crucial role in lipid droplet formation and lipolysis. It facilitates the recruitment of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) to lipid droplets, which is essential for lipid catabolism (Dejgaard2019Rab18). RAB18 is also implicated in the regulation of lysosomal and autophagic activities, particularly in neuronal cells, where it collaborates with Rab7 to modulate these processes (Nian2019Rab18).

RAB18's role extends to maintaining ER structure and facilitating ER-Golgi trafficking, which is vital for cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Nian2019Rab18). It is involved in the tethering of lipid droplets to the ER, aiding in lipid transfer and droplet growth (Dejgaard2019Rab18:). The protein's activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), with Rab3GAP acting as a GEF for RAB18 (Dejgaard2019Rab18:). Dysfunction of RAB18 is linked to Warburg Micro syndrome, highlighting its importance in human development and cellular function (Wu2016RAB18).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB18 gene are linked to Warburg Micro syndrome (WMS), a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental and neurological impairments. Clinical features of WMS include postnatal microcephaly, congenital bilateral cataracts, microphthalmia, microcornea, developmental delay, and progressive neurological deterioration (Nian2019Rab18; Banworth2017Consequences). Structural abnormalities in the central nervous system, such as bilateral polymicrogyria and hypogenesis of the corpus callosum, are also observed in patients (Nian2019Rab18).

The dysfunction of RAB18 affects lysosomal and autophagic activities in neurons, leading to impaired lysosomal transport and aberrant autophagy, which may contribute to axonal degeneration and the symptoms observed in WMS (Nian2019Rab18; Takáts2020The). RAB18 mutations can also result in defects in neuronal migration, affecting the development of the cerebral cortex and potentially leading to the neurological symptoms associated with WMS (Wu2016RAB18).

RAB18 interacts with Rab7, a lysosomal regulator, suggesting overlapping mechanisms in the pathogenesis of WMS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2B (Nian2019Rab18). These interactions highlight the critical role of RAB18 in maintaining proper neuronal function and development.

## Interactions
RAB18, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular processes. It interacts with the NRZ/Dsl and Syntaxin18 complexes, which are involved in membrane tethering and lipid transfer (Kiss2019Comparative). RAB18 also associates with SEC22A, a protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with RAB18 in a RAB3GAP-dependent manner. This interaction is significant for lipid droplet morphology, as silencing SEC22A leads to changes similar to those observed with RAB18 deficiency (Kiss2019Comparative).

RAB18 recruits the lipase TMCO4 to the ER membrane, also in a RAB3GAP-dependent manner, facilitating lipid mobilization and biosynthesis (Kiss2019Comparative). It interacts with proteins involved in cholesterol mobilization, such as ORP2/OSBPL2 and INPP5B, and is implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis through its interaction with EBP, a sterol isomerase (Kiss2019Comparative). RAB18's interaction with SPG20 is supported by reduced SPG20 levels in RAB18-null cells (Kiss2019Comparative).

In lipid droplet dynamics, RAB18 interacts with PLIN2 and ACSL3, facilitating triacylglycerol accumulation and lipid droplet growth (Deng2020Rab18). These interactions highlight RAB18's role in lipid metabolism and organelle communication.
