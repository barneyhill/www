# CALML3

## Overview
The CALML3 gene encodes the calmodulin-like protein 3, which is a calcium-binding protein primarily expressed in epithelial tissues such as the skin, breast, and prostate. This protein plays a pivotal role in the differentiation and function of epithelial cells, particularly keratinocytes, by regulating cell adhesion and motility through interactions with unconventional myosin-10 (Bennett2013Immunolocalization; Bennett2007Calmodulinlike). CALML3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity and the regulation of apoptosis and oxidative stress in response to UVB irradiation (Qin2017Calmodulinlike; Jia2018UVB). Its expression is inversely correlated with cell proliferation, making it a marker for terminal differentiation in the epidermis (Bennett2013Immunolocalization). Additionally, CALML3 has clinical significance in cancer biology and cataract formation, where it influences drug response and protects against UVB-induced damage, respectively (Qin2017Calmodulinlike; Jia2018UVB).

## Structure


## Function
The CALML3 gene encodes a calmodulin-like protein that functions as an epithelial-specific calcium-sensing protein. It is primarily expressed in tissues such as the skin, breast, prostate, and oral mucosa, where it plays a crucial role in the differentiation of keratinocytes and other epithelial cells (Bennett2013Immunolocalization; Brooks2013Human). CALML3 is involved in regulating cell adhesion and motility by interacting with unconventional myosin-10, which is important for cell migration and adhesion during terminal differentiation in stratified epithelia (Bennett2007Calmodulinlike).

In normal human skin, CALML3 is expressed throughout the epidermis, with increased intensity in the suprabasal and granular layers, indicating its role in the differentiation process of non-proliferating keratinocytes (Bennett2013Immunolocalization). The protein exhibits strong nuclear localization in the uppermost epidermal layers, which is associated with terminal cell differentiation and a postmitotic state (Bennett2013Immunolocalization). CALML3 expression is inversely correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67, suggesting that it serves as a marker for normal and benign hyperplastic epidermal development (Bennett2013Immunolocalization). The presence of CALML3 in the nucleus of fully differentiated keratinocytes is a characteristic sign of complete terminal differentiation in the epidermis (Bennett2013Immunolocalization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CALML3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in breast cancer and cataracts. In breast cancer, CALML3 acts as a coregulator of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), influencing gene expression and drug response. Its downregulation has been associated with altered responses to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and other cancer therapies. Specifically, reduced CALML3 expression makes breast cancer cells more resistant to SERMs but more sensitive to drugs like olaparib and cisplatin. This effect is mediated through the transcriptional regulation of BRCA1, a gene critical for DNA repair (Qin2017Calmodulinlike).

In the context of cataracts, CALML3 plays a role in protecting human lens epithelial cells from UVB-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of CALML3 leads to increased apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and intracellular calcium concentration, contributing to cataract formation. Overexpression of CALML3 can reverse these effects, suggesting its protective role against UVB-induced damage (Jia2018UVB).

Additionally, CALML3 has been identified as a potential immunohistochemical marker for distinguishing between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its clinical relevance in lung cancer diagnosis (zhan2015identification).

## Interactions
Calmodulin-like protein 3 (CALML3) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. CALML3 acts as a coregulator of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in a SNP-dependent manner, particularly interacting with the ZNF423 rs9940645 SNP. It binds to the DNA region containing this SNP and regulates the SNP-dependent binding of ERα to estrogen response elements (EREs), influencing the expression of ZNF423 and BRCA1 in breast cancer cells (Qin2017Calmodulinlike). The interaction between CALML3 and ERα is calcium-dependent, although its binding to the ZNF423 SNP sequence is independent of calcium (Qin2017Calmodulinlike).

CALML3 is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and oxidative stress in human lens epithelial cells under UVB irradiation. It modulates the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2, caspase-3, and Bax, and influences the JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (Jia2018UVB). In the context of gastric cancer, CALML3 is upregulated by metformin treatment in tumor-associated fibroblasts and exhibits a tumor-suppressive effect on gastric cancer cells, suggesting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Chen2018Metformin).
