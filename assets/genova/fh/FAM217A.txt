# FAM217A

## Overview
FAM217A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 217 member A. This protein is implicated in various biological processes, including reproductive and neuronal functions. It is notably expressed in the testis, where it interacts with sperm-associated antigen 6 (SPAG6) to influence sperm motility and structural integrity (Stigliani2024The). Additionally, FAM217A is responsive to environmental factors such as bisphenol A and bisphenol S, which can alter its expression in ovine granulosa cells (Téteau2023Bisphenol). The gene is also associated with sex-related CpG sites in primates, indicating a potential role in neuronal pathways (Horvath2023Panprimate). Furthermore, FAM217A has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in the context of inflammation-related biomarkers for gout, although its specific interactions in this context remain to be elucidated (Qiu2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
FAM217A is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of cryopreserved human spermatozoa, FAM217A is highly expressed in the testis and interacts with sperm-associated antigen 6 (SPAG6). This interaction is suggested to play a role in sperm flagellar motility and maintaining the structural integrity of mature sperm (Stigliani2024The). 

In studies involving bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) on ovine granulosa cells, FAM217A was identified as a differentially expressed gene, upregulated by both BPA and BPS. However, no specific signaling pathways involving FAM217A were identified in the context of BPS treatment (Téteau2023Bisphenol). 

Additionally, FAM217A is associated with sex-related CpG sites across various primate species, including humans. These sites are enriched in neuronal pathways, suggesting potential roles in neuronal development and function, although specific protein interactions were not detailed (Horvath2023Panprimate). 

In the context of inflammation-related biomarkers for gout, FAM217A was identified as a differentially expressed gene, but specific protein interactions were not highlighted (Qiu2022Identification).
