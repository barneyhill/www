# KRTAP19-1

## Overview
KRTAP19-1 is a gene located on chromosome 21q22.1 that encodes the keratin-associated protein 19-1, a member of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. This protein is characterized by its high glycine and tyrosine content, which contributes to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. The keratin-associated protein 19-1 is primarily expressed in the cortex/matrix cell region of the hair follicle, where it plays a crucial role in hair structure formation by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. The unique expression pattern of KRTAP19-1, which is expressed at high levels in contrast to other hair keratins, underscores its importance in maintaining the integrity and functionality of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human; Rogers2005Human).

## Structure
The KRTAP19-1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family, located on chromosome 21q22.1. These proteins are characterized by a high content of glycine (26.9-38.9 mol %) and tyrosine (15.4-23.6 mol %), along with moderate amounts of serine and phenylalanine residues (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP19-1 includes a significant number of dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures, which contribute to its molecular composition (Rogers2006Human).

The secondary structure of KRTAP19-1 is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the high glycine and tyrosine content suggests the presence of repetitive structures that are significant in its molecular composition (Rogers2006Human). The tertiary structure is likely stabilized by the repetitive nature of these sequences, although specific details are not provided.

KRTAP19-1 is expressed primarily in the cortex/matrix cell region of the hair follicle, playing a crucial role in hair structure formation (Rogers2006Human). The expression pattern of KRTAP19-1 is unique, as it is one of the few genes in its domain that shows high levels of expression, contrasting with the typical view that hair keratins are expressed before KAPs (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP19-1 encodes a keratin-associated protein that plays a significant role in the structure and function of human hair. This protein is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family, which is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP19-1 is primarily expressed in the cortex/matrix cell region of the hair follicle, an area crucial for hair structure formation (Rogers2006Human). The expression of KRTAP19-1, along with other KAP genes, is essential for the formation of keratin intermediate filaments, which are vital for the protective and structural properties of hair (Rogers2005Human).

The protein encoded by KRTAP19-1 is relatively small, ranging from 5.7 to 9.1 kDa, and contains numerous dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures (Rogers2006Human). These structural features allow KRTAP19-1 to interact with keratin filaments, influencing hair texture and quality. The expression patterns and structural characteristics of KRTAP19-1 highlight its importance in maintaining the integrity and functionality of hair fibers in healthy human cells (Rogers2006Human).
