# G6PD

## Overview
The G6PD gene encodes the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the first step of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and is essential for the production of NADPH, a critical cofactor in maintaining cellular redox balance and supporting biosynthetic processes (GarcíaDomínguez2022Glucose; Cappellini2008Glucose6phosphate). The G6PD gene is located on the X chromosome, and its expression is crucial in tissues exposed to high oxidative stress, such as red blood cells. Mutations in the G6PD gene can lead to G6PD deficiency, a common enzymatic disorder that increases susceptibility to oxidative damage, resulting in conditions such as hemolytic anemia (Luzzatto2016Glucose6Phosphate; Mason2007G6PD). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including interactions with proteins like p53, and is subject to post-translational modifications that influence its function and stability (Wu2023Acetylationdependent; Jiang2011p53).

## Structure
The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme is a crucial component of the pentose phosphate pathway, with a primary structure consisting of 515 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 59 kDa (Cappellini2008Glucose6phosphate; GómezManzo2017Functional). The secondary structure of G6PD includes α-helices and β-sheets, with a notable β-α-β dinucleotide binding site in the N-terminal domain (MoralesLuna2018Biochemical; GómezManzo2017Functional). 

The tertiary structure of G6PD is characterized by two domains: the N-terminal domain, which contains the β-α-β dinucleotide binding site, and a larger β+α domain with an antiparallel nine-stranded sheet (Cappellini2008Glucose6phosphate). The enzyme's quaternary structure typically exists in a dimer or tetramer form, with the dimer being the catalytically active form (GómezManzo2016Glucose6Phosphate; HernándezOchoa2023An). 

G6PD contains specific domains for NADP+ and glucose-6-phosphate binding, which are essential for its enzymatic function (HernándezOchoa2023An). The enzyme's stability and function are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as the removal of the N-terminal methionine and the assembly into its quaternary structure (Luzzatto1985Glucose6Phosphate). These structural features are critical for maintaining the enzyme's activity and stability, particularly in red blood cells.

## Function
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a critical enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. It catalyzes the first committed step of the oxidative branch of the PPP, converting glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to 6-phosphogluconate while generating NADPH (Stanton2012Glucose‐6‐phosphate; GarcíaDomínguez2022Glucose). NADPH is essential for maintaining redox homeostasis in cells, serving as an electron donor for antioxidant enzymes like glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductases, which are crucial for detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) (GarcíaDomínguez2022Glucose; Li2020Exploring).

G6PD is highly regulated by various factors, including transcriptional and post-translational modifications, and is influenced by the NADPH/NADP ratio (Stanton2012Glucose‐6‐phosphate). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is particularly important in tissues with high oxidative stress, such as red blood cells, where it helps prevent hemolysis (Li2020Exploring).

In addition to its role in antioxidant defense, NADPH produced by G6PD is involved in biosynthetic reactions, providing reducing power for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (GarcíaDomínguez2022Glucose). G6PD's activity is crucial for cell survival, growth, and protection against ROS-mediated cell death (Stanton2012Glucose‐6‐phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the G6PD gene lead to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, a genetic disorder with significant clinical implications. This X-linked condition primarily affects red blood cells, causing them to be more susceptible to oxidative damage. The most common clinical manifestations include neonatal jaundice, acute hemolytic anemia, and chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) (Luzzatto2016Glucose6Phosphate; Mason2007G6PD). Neonatal jaundice can result in severe complications like kernicterus if not treated promptly (Cappellini2008Glucose6phosphate). Acute hemolytic anemia is often triggered by infections, certain drugs, or the ingestion of fava beans, leading to symptoms such as malaise and hemoglobinuria (Mason2007G6PD).

G6PD deficiency is also associated with favism, a condition triggered by the consumption of fava beans, which contain oxidizing agents that can cause hemolysis (Roper2020Laboratory). Chronic hemolytic anemia, although rare, can occur in individuals with certain G6PD variants, leading to chronic hemolysis and requiring long-term management (Roper2020Laboratory; Mason2007G6PD). The deficiency is prevalent in regions historically affected by malaria, as it provides some resistance to the disease (Beutler1994G6PD).

## Interactions
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) interacts with several proteins, most notably the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 directly binds to G6PD, inhibiting its activity by preventing the formation of the active dimeric G6PD holoenzyme. This interaction is incompatible with the binding of NADP+, a necessary cofactor for G6PD activity, thus regulating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and affecting cellular metabolism (Jiang2011p53). The interaction between p53 and G6PD is transient and occurs at substoichiometric ratios, with p53 acting as a catalyst to induce conformational changes in G6PD (Jiang2011p53).

Acetylation of G6PD at specific lysine residues, such as K403, can modulate its interaction with p53, rendering G6PD inactive and monomeric. This acetylation also influences the phosphorylation of G6PD by Fyn kinase, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism involving acetylation and phosphorylation (Wu2023Acetylationdependent). These interactions highlight the role of G6PD in linking metabolic pathways with apoptotic signaling and cellular stress responses.
