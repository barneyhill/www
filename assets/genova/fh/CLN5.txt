# CLN5

## Overview
The CLN5 gene encodes the CLN5 intracellular trafficking protein, a lysosomal glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cellular processes such as endosomal sorting and lysosomal function. Initially synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein, CLN5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are essential for its stability and function. The mature form of the protein is soluble within the lysosomal lumen, where it is involved in the activation of Rab7, a small GTPase crucial for endosomal trafficking. This activation facilitates the recruitment of the retromer complex to endosomal membranes, thereby ensuring proper lysosomal sorting and trafficking. CLN5 is also implicated in the regulation of lysosomal pH, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Mutations in the CLN5 gene are associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, specifically variant late-infantile NCL, a form of Batten disease characterized by neurodegeneration and lysosomal dysfunction (Yasa2020CLN5; Basak2021A; Mamo2012The).

## Structure
The CLN5 protein is a lysosomal glycoprotein with a sequence of 358 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 48.36 kDa (Basak2021A). It is initially synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus and a large luminal C-terminal domain (Larkin2013Topology). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability, folding, and trafficking. There are eight potential N-glycosylation sites, with five being essential for proper protein folding and lysosomal function (Basak2021A).

The mature form of CLN5 is a soluble protein within the lysosomal lumen, following cleavage of the signal peptide and removal of the transmembrane domain (Jules2017CLN5). The protein is tightly associated with the membrane through an amphipathic helix (AH) located in the amino acid region 353-392, which is crucial for its membrane association (Larkin2013Topology). This AH is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in function and localization (Larkin2013Topology). The presence of glycosylated CLN5 polypeptides in the media of cultured cells supports the hypothesis of an N-terminal signal peptide cleavage, similar to other soluble lysosomal proteins (Basak2021A).

## Function
The CLN5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in endosomal sorting and lysosomal function in healthy human cells. CLN5 is involved in the activation of Rab7, a small GTPase essential for endosomal trafficking, by acting as part of the Rab7 activation machinery. This activation is necessary for the recruitment of the retromer complex to endosomal membranes, facilitating the retrograde trafficking of lysosomal sorting receptors such as CI-MPR and sortilin to the Golgi compartment, thereby preventing their degradation (Mamo2012The).

CLN5 is primarily localized in lysosomes but is also found in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in the trafficking of proteins to lysosomes via the mannose-6-phosphate dependent pathway. The protein undergoes glycosylation, which is crucial for its proper folding, trafficking, and function (Basak2021A).

In addition to its role in lysosomal trafficking, CLN5 is implicated in the regulation of lysosomal pH, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. It modulates the palmitoylation of Rab7A, which is crucial for the recruitment of retromer to endosomal membranes, ensuring efficient endosome-to-TGN retrieval of sortilin (Yasa2020CLN5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLN5 gene are associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), specifically a variant known as variant late-infantile NCL (vLINCL), which is a form of Batten disease. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as motor deficits, mental deterioration, cognitive impairment, visual impairment, and epileptic seizures, typically with an onset between 4 and 7 years of age. The life expectancy for individuals with vLINCL is generally between 10 and 30 years, although some may live longer (Basak2021A; Kousi2011Update).

The CLN5 gene encodes a lysosomal glycoprotein, and mutations can lead to lysosomal dysfunction due to the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material. This dysfunction is linked to neurodegeneration, with pathology including neuronal demise, cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, and loss of cortical neurons (Basak2021A; Kousi2011Update). 

Mutations in CLN5 have been identified worldwide, with a notable founder mutation, p.Tyr392X, in Finnish patients (Kousi2011Update). Additionally, rare variants of CLN5 have been suggested as candidate risk factors for other neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (Basak2021A).

## Interactions
The CLN5 protein is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly with other neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) proteins. It interacts with PPT1/CLN1, TPP1/CLN2, CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8, suggesting shared pathways among these proteins (Basak2021A). CLN5 and CLN1/PPT1 colocalize from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome, and CLN5 interacts with premature ER forms of CLN1. Overexpression of CLN1 can restore the localization of mutated CLN5 to lysosomes, but CLN5 cannot rescue a localization-defective mutant of CLN1 (Basak2021A). CLN5 and mature CLN2 interact after leaving the ER, possibly in late endosomes or lysosomes, and mutations in CLN5 affect its interaction with CLN2 (Basak2021A).

Beyond NCL proteins, CLN5 co-immunoprecipitates with the lysosomal sorting receptor sortilin, Rab7, and Rab5, but not Rab1a (Basak2021A). CLN5's interaction with dihydroceramide synthase (CerS) was confirmed, although more recent proteomics studies have not supported these findings (Basak2021A). High-throughput studies have identified at least 43 interactors of CLN5 using affinity capture-mass spectrometry methods (Basak2021A). CLN5 also plays a role in facilitating interactions between Rab7A and the retromer complex, as well as between retromer and sortilin (Yasa2020CLN5).
