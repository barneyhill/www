# CUL7

## Overview
CUL7 is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 7, a member of the cullin family of proteins, which are integral components of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes play a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a system responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as growth, senescence, and apoptosis (Sarikas2008The; Xu2008The). The cullin 7 protein is characterized by its large size and unique structural domains, including a conserved cullin domain, a DOC domain, and a CPH domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function in ubiquitination (Hopf2022Structure). Notably, cullin 7 is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling pathways and interacts with key proteins such as IRS-1 and TP53, influencing their stability and activity (Sarikas2008The; Xu2008The). Mutations in the CUL7 gene are linked to 3M syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Huber2008A; Hanson2012Mutations).

## Structure
The CUL7 protein is a large member of the cullin family, composed of 1698 amino acids in humans, and is involved in forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Its structure is characterized by several distinct domains, including a highly conserved cullin domain, a DOC domain, and a CPH domain. The CPH domain is known for binding TP53, with the interaction surface on TP53 mapped to the tetramerization domain (Sarikas2008The).

CUL7's structure includes a unique arrangement of domains, such as a small beta-domain (SBD) connected to three armadillo repeat units (ARM1, ARM2, ARM3), which wrap around a junction helix connecting the N- and C-terminal regions. The cullin region of CUL7 starts with CR2 and CR3 domains, followed by a four-helix bundle (4HB), a mixed α-helix/β-sheet region, an α/β-to-WHB linker, and a C-terminal WHB domain (Hopf2022Structure).

CUL7 forms a complex with RBX1 and SKP1-FBXW8, but unlike other cullins, it lacks the domain that typically binds the SKP1-F-box motif. Despite this, CUL7-RBX1 exclusively associates with SKP1 bound to FBXW8 (Hopf2022Structure). The CRL7 FBXW8 complex, which includes CUL7, forms a unique cullin-RING ligase assembly, distinct from canonical CRLs (Hopf2022Structure). CUL7 is not neddylated, as its structure prevents this modification (Hopf2022Structure).

## Function
The CUL7 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the cullin-RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway is responsible for the selective degradation of proteins, thereby regulating various biological processes. In healthy human cells, CUL7 is involved in maintaining proper protein levels and regulating cellular processes such as growth, senescence, and possibly apoptosis and p53 regulation (Xu2008The).

CUL7 targets insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, which is crucial for regulating insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways. This regulation is important for controlling downstream signaling pathways such as Akt and MEK/ERK, which are involved in cell growth and survival (Xu2008The). The degradation of IRS-1 by CUL7 is part of a negative-feedback loop involving mTOR/S6K, which regulates IRS-1 stability and activity, thereby restraining PI3-K activity (Xu2008The).

CUL7 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting mono- and di-ubiquitination of p53, but not polyubiquitination, and repressing p53-dependent transactivation activity. This interaction suggests a role in modulating p53 activity, which could be relevant to its function in cell growth regulation (Andrews2006Cytoplasmic; Sarikas2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CUL7 gene are primarily associated with 3M syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, and skeletal abnormalities. The syndrome is linked to mutations in the CUL7 gene, which account for the majority of cases, with other genes like OBSL1 and CCDC8 also implicated (Huber2008A; Xu2023Chinese). CUL7 mutations often result in frameshift or nonsense mutations, leading to truncated proteins and loss of function, which disrupts normal growth factor signaling pathways (Hanson2012Mutations; Shaikh2019Novel).

The clinical features of 3M syndrome include a triangular face, midface hypoplasia, and skeletal changes such as long slender tubular bones and tall vertebral bodies (Maksimova2007Clinical; Simsek‐Kiper2019Further). Despite these physical manifestations, intelligence remains normal in affected individuals (Huber2008A). The CUL7 protein is crucial for the formation of the 3M complex, which is involved in ubiquitination and cell cycle regulation. Disruptions in these processes due to CUL7 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of 3M syndrome (Hanson2012Mutations; Shaikh2019Novel).

## Interactions
CUL7 is involved in several protein interactions, forming distinct complexes that play roles in ubiquitination and cellular regulation. It interacts with RBX1 and CUL9, and together with RBX1, it binds OBSL1 and CCDC8 to form the '3M' complex, which is associated with 3M syndrome and is involved in the ubiquitination of the plasma membrane protein PHLDB2 (Hopf2022Structure). CUL7 also interacts with TP53, with the CPH domain of CUL7 binding to the tetramerization domain of TP53. This interaction influences TP53's transcriptional activity and subcellular localization, although it does not lead to TP53's proteolytic degradation (Sarikas2008The).

CUL7 forms a unique complex with FBXW8 and SKP1, distinct from the CUL1-RBX1 complex, which binds multiple SKP1-F-box protein modules. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of an active E3 ubiquitin ligase (Hopf2022Structure). CUL7 also interacts with IRS-1, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation in an mTOR-dependent manner (Sarikas2008The). Additionally, CUL7 binds to the SV40 T antigen, which is necessary for SV40-induced transformation (Sarikas2008The).
