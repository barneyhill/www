# PNPT1

## Overview
The PNPT1 gene encodes the enzyme polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1 (PNPase), a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in RNA processing and degradation. PNPase is categorized as a ribonuclease and is primarily located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it is involved in the degradation of RNA from the 3'-end to the 5'-end, contributing to mitochondrial RNA homeostasis (Falchi2022Activity). The enzyme forms part of the mitochondrial degradosome complex, which is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial genome stability by degrading double-stranded RNA (Falchi2022Activity). Additionally, PNPase facilitates the import of non-coding RNAs into mitochondria, a function critical for mitochondrial transcription and translation processes (Wang2012PNPASE). Mutations in the PNPT1 gene are linked to various mitochondrial and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Sgobbi2024PNPT1).

## Structure
The PNPT1 protein, also known as polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1, is a mitochondrial protein involved in RNA processing. It consists of multiple domains, including the ribonuclease PH (RNAse PH), ribonuclease PH C (RNAse PH C), polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), K homology (KH), and S1 RNA binding (S1) domains, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Hosseini2021Crystallographic). The RNAse PH domain is crucial for phosphate-dependent 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic degradation of RNAs, and it is highly conserved (Hosseini2021Crystallographic).

The protein's structure is described as a conserved trimeric doughnut-shaped architecture, with six RNase PH domains forming a central channel. This channel interacts with the catalytic site of one of the PHII domains through the 3′ end of a single-stranded RNA molecule (Hosseini2021Crystallographic). The active site of the protein includes an alpha-helix structure, which is critical for its function (Hosseini2021Crystallographic). The PNPT1 protein is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it plays a role in RNA processing and degradation (Hosseini2021Crystallographic). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications and splice variants, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context.

## Function
The PNPT1 gene encodes the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial RNA metabolism and homeostasis. PNPase is primarily located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) and is involved in the degradation of RNA from the 3'-end to the 5'-end, generating nucleoside diphosphates (Falchi2022Activity). It forms a complex with the SUV3 helicase, known as the mitochondrial degradosome (mtDEG), which is essential for the degradation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the maintenance of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) stability (Falchi2022Activity). This complex limits the amount of dsRNA in mitochondria by degrading antisense RNAs, contributing to mitochondrial genome stability (Falchi2022Activity).

PNPase is also involved in the import of non-coding RNAs into mitochondria, a function distinct from its RNA-processing activity (Wang2012PNPASE). It facilitates the translocation of RNAs such as RNase P, 5S rRNA, and MRP RNA from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, playing a role in mitochondrial transcription and translation processes (Falchi2022Activity; Sato2017Novel). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, and its deficiency can lead to mitochondrial disorders (Cameron2018Polynucleotide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PNPT1 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial and neurological disorders. Pathogenic variants can lead to conditions such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia 25 (SCA25), characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and sensory axonal polyneuropathy, in an autosomal dominant context (Sgobbi2024PNPT1). Autosomal recessive conditions include Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency Type 13 and Autosomal Recessive Deafness Type 70, which can present with severe multisystemic symptoms, including Leigh syndrome (Sgobbi2024PNPT1; Vedrenne2012Mutation).

PNPT1 mutations can impair mitochondrial RNA import, leading to deficiencies in the respiratory chain and mitochondrial dysfunction (Alodaib2016Wholeexome; Vedrenne2012Mutation). This dysfunction is linked to oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies and neurodegeneration (Sgobbi2024PNPT1). Additionally, PNPT1-related diseases may involve an increased type I interferon response due to the accumulation of double-stranded mitochondrial RNAs, linking them to interferonopathies such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (Bamborschke2021PNPT1; Pennisi2020Heterogeneity).

Clinical presentations of PNPT1 mutations are highly variable, ranging from non-syndromic hearing loss to severe multisystemic disorders, with neuroimaging findings often showing basal ganglia lesions or white matter abnormalities (Rius2019Clinical; Pennisi2020Heterogeneity).

## Interactions
PNPT1, also known as polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial RNA processing and degradation. During apoptosis, PNPT1 is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol, where it binds to decaying poly(A) RNAs, such as ACTB, GAPDH, and SNHG11, but not to non-decaying non-poly(A) RNAs like RPPH1 and 5S, suggesting a selective binding mechanism that promotes RNA decay (Liu2018PNPT1).

PNPT1 forms a homotrimeric complex, which is essential for its function in RNA degradation. This trimerization is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to degrade RNAs with unstructured 3' ends while RNAs with structured 3' ends, such as those with stem-loops, resist degradation (Liu2018PNPT1). The structural basis of PNPT1's RNA degradation activity involves a narrow RNA channel that permits the selective degradation of certain RNAs (Liu2018PNPT1).

Mutations in PNPT1, such as E475G, can alter its RNA binding and degradation activity, affecting the protein's structure and function. These mutations can impair the trimerization of PNPT1, leading to functional deficits in RNA processing and mitochondrial RNA import (von2012A; Pizzoccheri2024Pathological).
