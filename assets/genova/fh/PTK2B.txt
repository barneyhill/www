# PTK2B

## Overview
PTK2B, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta, is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family. The protein product of PTK2B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival, particularly within the central nervous system and immune cells. It plays a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways by interacting with focal adhesion complexes and modulating key components of the innate immune response, such as TBK1 and STING. PTK2B's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which is essential for its function in signaling pathways related to antiviral responses and vascular integrity. The gene has been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer, due to its involvement in neuroinflammation, calcium signaling, and cell migration (Lin2023PTK2B; Beck2014Adaptors; Bello2023An).

## Structure
PTK2B, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family. The protein is characterized by several distinct domains: an N-terminal FERM domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal focal adhesion-targeting (FAT) domain. These domains facilitate its interaction with various proteins and its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Beck2014Adaptors).

The FERM domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the localization of PTK2B to focal adhesions. The central kinase domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity, which includes the phosphorylation of substrates such as leupaxin (LPXN) and TBK1, playing a role in cell migration and antiviral signaling (Lin2023PTK2B; Allert2022Protein). The FAT domain at the C-terminal end allows PTK2B to bind to paxillin, a component of focal adhesion complexes (Beck2014Adaptors).

PTK2B undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions. This phosphorylation is often triggered by integrin ligation and is essential for the recruitment of other signaling proteins (Beck2014Adaptors). PTK2B is known to have splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not extensively covered in the available literature.

## Function
PTK2B, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system. It plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways related to cell adhesion, migration, and survival. PTK2B is part of the focal adhesion kinase family and is highly expressed in the central nervous system, where it contributes to neurite growth and synapse formation by associating with adhesion complexes containing integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR (Beck2014Adaptors).

In immune cells, PTK2B is involved in regulating antiviral signaling pathways. It interacts with TBK1 and STING, key components of the innate immune response, enhancing their oligomerization and activation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of antiviral genes and the modulation of viral replication, indicating PTK2B's role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Lin2023PTK2B).

PTK2B also influences vascular functions by promoting the phosphorylation of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), which enhances vasodilatation and angiogenesis. It stabilizes AKT kinase activity and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, further supporting vascular integrity (Beck2014Adaptors).

## Clinical Significance
PTK2B, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta, is implicated in several diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). Variants in the PTK2B gene have been associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs28834970 as significant (Beck2014Adaptors). This variant affects microglial function, leading to altered chemokine expression and reduced chemotaxis, which may impact the microglial response to amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology (Bello2023An).

PTK2B is also involved in neuroinflammation and calcium signaling, processes that are disrupted in AD. It modulates NMDA receptor function and MAPK signaling, which are crucial for neuronal health (Beck2014Adaptors). The gene's interaction with Tau protein suggests a role in Tau-related neurodegenerative processes, with PTK2B accumulation observed in early stages of AD pathology (Dourlen2016Functional).

Beyond Alzheimer's, PTK2B is linked to hypertension, a condition that can be managed pharmacologically, potentially reducing the risk of AD dementia (Beck2014Adaptors). Additionally, PTK2B's role in cell adhesion and migration implicates it in cancer progression and cardiovascular diseases (Beck2014Adaptors).

## Interactions
PTK2B, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. PTK2B interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), both of which are crucial components of the cGAS-STING pathway involved in innate immune responses. PTK2B enhances TBK1 activity through phosphorylation, specifically at residue Tyr591, which is critical for TBK1 oligomerization and activation. This interaction is kinase-dependent and is essential for antiviral signaling (Lin2023PTK2B).

PTK2B also interacts with STING, promoting its oligomerization in a kinase-independent manner. This interaction is important for the regulation of the STING-TBK1 signaling pathway, which is vital for efficient antiviral responses (Lin2023PTK2B).

In the context of cancer and Alzheimer's disease, PTK2B interacts with proteins such as NEDD9 and CASS4, which are part of the Crk-associated substrate (CAS) family. These interactions are crucial for cellular attachment to the extracellular matrix and involve phosphorylation events that lead to changes in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (Beck2014Adaptors).
