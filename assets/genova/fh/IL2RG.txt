# IL2RG

## Overview
The IL2RG gene encodes the interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (γc), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by forming part of the receptor complexes for several interleukins, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. This protein is essential for the proper functioning and development of various immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, through its involvement in cytokine signaling pathways (Cifaldi2020Partial; Tuovinen2020Novel). The γc subunit is a critical component of the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways, which are activated upon cytokine binding and are crucial for immune cell proliferation and differentiation (Rochman2009New; Ross2018Signaling). Mutations in IL2RG can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), underscoring its clinical significance (Weisser2018Interleukin2; Puck1993The).

## Structure
The IL2RG gene encodes the interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain, a crucial component of the cytokine receptor complex. The protein is composed of 369 amino acids and includes extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains (RutkowskaZapała2022Novel). The extracellular domain contains conserved cysteines and repeated tryptophan and serine motifs, which are characteristic of cytokine receptors (RutkowskaZapała2022Novel). 

The secondary structure of the IL2RG protein includes α-helices and β-sheets, although predictions for these structures have low confidence (RutkowskaZapała2022Novel). The γc subunit, part of the IL-2 receptor complex, features a disulfide bridge and a tryptophan-arginine ladder, including the conserved WSXWS motif, which is common in cytokine receptors (Stauber2006Crystal). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the γc subunit forms part of a heterotrimeric assembly with IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ, crucial for high-affinity binding and signal transduction (Stauber2006Crystal). The γc subunit's interaction with IL-2 involves a relatively small interface, indicating its role in multiple cytokine receptor complexes (Stauber2006Crystal). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the solubility and proper assembly of the IL-2 receptor complex (Stauber2006Crystal).

## Function
The IL2RG gene encodes the common gamma chain (γc), a critical component of several interleukin receptor complexes, including those for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. This protein is essential for the development and function of immune cells, particularly T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (Cifaldi2020Partial; Tuovinen2020Novel). In healthy human cells, IL2RG is expressed on the surface of lymphocytes and is involved in signal transduction necessary for immune cell proliferation and differentiation (Tuovinen2020Novel).

The IL2RG protein facilitates the activation of Janus kinases (JAK1 and JAK3) upon ligand binding, leading to the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). This process is crucial for the expression of target genes that are essential for immune cell development and function (Tuovinen2020Novel). Specifically, IL2RG-mediated signaling is vital for the development of T and NK cells, as well as for the maintenance of regulatory T cells and B cell differentiation (Melsen2022T; Tuovinen2020Novel). Defective signaling through IL2RG can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) (Cifaldi2020Partial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL2RG gene, which encodes the interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain, are primarily associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), a life-threatening condition characterized by a severely compromised immune system. X-SCID is marked by a deficiency of T and NK lymphocytes and non-functional B lymphocytes, leading to severe and recurrent infections, often resulting in early mortality if untreated (Weisser2018Interleukin2; Puck1993The). Over 300 mutations in IL2RG have been identified, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, which disrupt the normal function of the gamma chain, impairing cytokine signaling crucial for immune cell development and function (Kalman2004Mutations; Hou2021Somatic).

In addition to classical X-SCID, hypomorphic mutations in IL2RG can lead to atypical or "leaky" X-SCID, where patients may have residual immune function and present with milder symptoms, such as chronic lung disease and recurrent infections (Hou2021Somatic; Belaid2021Case). Some cases of atypical X-SCID are associated with somatic mosaicism, where spontaneous genetic reversion occurs, leading to a mixture of normal and mutant cells (Hou2021Somatic). These genetic variations highlight the clinical variability and complexity associated with IL2RG mutations.

## Interactions
The IL2RG gene encodes the common gamma chain (γc), which is a critical component of several cytokine receptor complexes, including those for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. IL2RG interacts with other receptor subunits to form functional receptor complexes that are essential for cytokine signaling. In the IL-2 receptor complex, IL2RG forms a trimeric structure with IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ, facilitating the binding of IL-2 and subsequent signal transduction (Malek2008The; Ross2018Signaling).

IL2RG is involved in activating the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Specifically, IL2RG interacts with JAK3, and upon cytokine binding, this interaction leads to the activation of JAK1 and JAK3, which phosphorylate STAT proteins such as STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT3. These phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (Rochman2009New; Ross2018Signaling).

Mutations in IL2RG, such as the p.(Pro58Ser) mutation, can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired cytokine signaling and conditions like X-linked combined immunodeficiency (X-CID) (Tuovinen2020Novel). The mutation affects the expression and localization of the IL-2 receptor complex, impacting its ability to mediate signal transduction (Tuovinen2020Novel).
