# TKFC

## Overview
The TKFC gene encodes the bifunctional enzyme triokinase and FMN cyclase, which plays a pivotal role in both carbohydrate and flavin metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase due to its ATP-dependent phosphorylation activity, specifically targeting glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, key intermediates in fructose metabolism. Additionally, it functions as a cyclase, catalyzing the conversion of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to riboflavin cyclic 4',5'-phosphate, a crucial step in maintaining cellular redox balance. Structurally, the enzyme operates as a homodimer, with distinct domains responsible for its dual functions. Mutations in the TKFC gene have been implicated in various metabolic and immunological disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Ashaat2024Biallelic; TremblayLaganière2024Homozygous; Wortmann2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The TKFC gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in fructose metabolism and FMN cyclase activity. The protein functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing two main domains: the DHA kinase (K) domain, spanning residues 1-339, and the FMN lyase (L) domain, covering residues 359-575. These domains are connected by a linker region from residues 340-358 (Ashaat2024Biallelic; Wortmann2020Biallelic). The protein structure is described as having intertwined subunits forming an elongated L2-K1-K2-L1 configuration, with active sites located between the L2-K1 and K2-L1 domains (Ashaat2024Biallelic; Rodrigues2019Closure).

The K domain is responsible for ATP-dependent phosphorylation, while the L domain is involved in the Mn2+-dependent splitting of FAD (Ashaat2024Biallelic). The protein's active sites are formed at the interfaces between the K and L domains of different subunits, where triose binds to the K domain and ATP binds to the L domain (Rodrigues2019Closure). The protein's structure is similar to that of Citrobacter sp. DHA kinase, which has a unique fold defining Group 9 in kinase classification (Rodrigues2019Closure).

Mutations in the TKFC gene, such as p.Gly192Arg and p.Arg228Trp, are located near the active site and may affect triokinase activity by altering substrate binding and active site conformation (Onoufriadis2020Autosomal).

## Function
The TKFC gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme known as triokinase and FMN cyclase, which plays a crucial role in carbohydrate and flavin metabolism. In healthy human cells, this enzyme is involved in the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde (GA) and dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which are important steps in fructose metabolism. This process prevents the accumulation of reactive aldehyde groups, which can be harmful to cells (Ashaat2024Biallelic; Rodrigues2019Closure). The enzyme also catalyzes the conversion of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to riboflavin cyclic 4',5'-phosphate (cyclic FMN), a process that is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and energy production (TremblayLaganière2024Homozygous; Wortmann2020Biallelic).

Structurally, the TKFC enzyme is a homodimer composed of two domains, K and L, which form two active sites necessary for its catalytic activities (Rodrigues2019Closure). The enzyme's activity is crucial for metabolic pathways that require the phosphorylation of GA and DHA, contributing to cellular homeostasis and preventing mitochondrial stress (Wortmann2020Biallelic). The TKFC protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates these metabolic processes (Rodrigues2019Closure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TKFC gene, which encodes the enzyme triokinase and FMN cyclase, are associated with several multisystem disorders. Bi-allelic variants in TKFC have been linked to a condition known as Triokinase and FMN Cyclase Deficiency Syndrome (TKFCD), characterized by cataracts, developmental delay, cardiomyopathy, liver dysfunction, microcytic anemia, lactic acidosis, and cerebellar hypoplasia (TremblayLaganière2024Homozygous; Wortmann2020Biallelic). These mutations result in impaired fructose metabolism, leading to the accumulation of by-products such as glyceraldehyde, which can cause protein dysfunction and contribute to cataract formation (Wortmann2020Biallelic).

In addition to metabolic disorders, TKFC mutations have been implicated in isolated immunodeficiency. A homozygous variant in the TKFC gene has been associated with severe primary immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent viral infections and a compromised immune response (TremblayLaganière2024Homozygous). The gene's role in regulating antiviral immunity suggests that its deficiency may impair the immune response to viral illnesses, potentially leading to severe outcomes (Wortmann2020Biallelic).

Furthermore, TKFC mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive hypotrichosis with loose anagen hairs, a condition characterized by sparse and slow-growing hair (Onoufriadis2020Autosomal). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of TKFC gene mutations.

## Interactions
The human TKFC (triokinase and FMN cyclase) protein is involved in several interactions that influence its function and role in metabolic pathways. TKFC is known to interact with MDA5, an RNA helicase that acts as a viral RNA sensor during replication, to regulate the antiviral immune response. This interaction is significant as MDA5 is involved in inducing interferon expression, which is crucial for the immune response against viral infections (TremblayLaganière2024Homozygous).

In the context of its enzymatic activity, TKFC functions as a homodimeric protein with two domains, K and L, which are essential for its kinase and cyclase activities. The enzyme's activity involves the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyceraldehyde (GA), as well as the splitting of FAD to form cyclic FMN. The structural dynamics of TKFC, including the mobility of its domains, are crucial for its function, as these movements facilitate the closure of the active site necessary for phosphoryl transfer (Rodrigues2019Closure).

Additionally, TKFC's role in fructose metabolism and riboflavin biosynthesis suggests it may interact with other proteins involved in these pathways, potentially forming complexes or engaging in regulatory interactions that influence cellular energy balance and metabolic processes (Iizuka2023Recent).
