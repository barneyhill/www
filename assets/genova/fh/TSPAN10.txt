# TSPAN10

## Overview
TSPAN10 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 10, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of the tetraspanin family. Tetraspanin 10 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM10, influencing its maturation, trafficking, and function within the cell. This regulation is crucial for processes such as Notch signaling, which is important for cell communication and development (Matthews2018Regulation; Haining2012The). TSPAN10's involvement in the tetraspanin web, a network of protein interactions at the cell membrane, underscores its significance in various physiological and pathological contexts, including ocular health and diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease (SaintPol2017Regulation). Genetic variations in TSPAN10 have been linked to several eye conditions, highlighting its clinical relevance (Martinez2023Genetics; Plotnikov2019A).

## Function
TSPAN10, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, plays a crucial role in regulating the maturation and trafficking of ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease involved in various cellular processes. TSPAN10 facilitates the exit of ADAM10 from the endoplasmic reticulum and its subsequent maturation, which is essential for ADAM10's function as an ectodomain sheddase (Matthews2018Regulation; Haining2012The). TSPAN10, along with other TspanC8 tetraspanins, can target ADAM10 to specific subcellular localizations, influencing its interaction with different substrates and affecting processes such as Notch signaling (Matthews2018Regulation; Dornier2012TspanC8).

In healthy human cells, TSPAN10 is involved in the regulation of Notch signaling pathways by promoting ADAM10-mediated shedding of Notch receptors, a process crucial for cell-cell communication during development and in adult life (Matthews2018Regulation; Dornier2012TspanC8). TSPAN10's interaction with ADAM10 is characterized by its ability to compartmentalize ADAM10 into membrane microdomains, facilitating its interaction with various transmembrane target proteins (Haining2012The). This regulatory function of TSPAN10 is vital for maintaining proper cellular communication and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TSPAN10 gene have been associated with several ocular conditions. A genome-wide association study identified a genetic variant within the NPLOC4-TSPAN10-PDE6G gene cluster that is significantly associated with the risk of strabismus, a condition characterized by abnormal eye alignment. The lead variant, rs75078292, was found to have a population-attributable risk of approximately 8.4% for strabismus, suggesting a notable genetic contribution to the disorder (Plotnikov2019A). The study highlighted two candidate causal variants in the TSPAN10 gene: rs6420484, which results in a tyrosine to cysteine substitution (C177Y), and rs397693108, a 4-bp deletion predicted to cause a frameshift, both of which are predicted to have functional effects (Plotnikov2019A).

TSPAN10 polymorphisms have also been linked to other eye conditions, such as macular thickness, astigmatism, and myopia, indicating its broader role in ocular health (Martinez2023Genetics). The gene's expression in cone photoreceptors suggests its involvement in visual processing, further supporting its clinical significance in eye disorders (Plotnikov2019A).

## Interactions
TSPAN10, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, interacts with the metalloprotease ADAM10, a type-I transmembrane protein involved in the proteolytic cleavage of various substrates, including cytokines, adhesion molecules, and Notch receptors. TSPAN10, along with other TspanC8 tetraspanins such as Tspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan17, and Tspan33, regulates the trafficking and function of ADAM10. These interactions are crucial for ADAM10's exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and its subsequent maturation and cell surface expression (SaintPol2017Regulation; Haining2012The).

TSPAN10 specifically targets ADAM10 to late endosomes, differing from other TspanC8 tetraspanins that increase ADAM10 expression at the plasma membrane. This differential regulation affects ADAM10 substrate selectivity and Notch signaling (SaintPol2017Regulation). Although TSPAN10 interacts relatively poorly with ADAM10 compared to other TspanC8 members, it still promotes significant ADAM10 maturation (Haining2012The).

The interaction between TSPAN10 and ADAM10 is part of a larger network of interactions known as the tetraspanin web, which organizes molecular interactions at the cell membrane (SaintPol2017Regulation). These interactions are significant in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease (SaintPol2017Regulation).
