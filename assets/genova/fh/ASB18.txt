# ASB18

## Overview
ASB18 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 18, which is part of the ankyrin repeat SOCS box (ASB) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains and a SOCS box, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and the ubiquitination process. The ankyrin repeat domains facilitate binding to other proteins, potentially marking them for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, cell cycle, and apoptosis (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB18 is predominantly expressed in heart muscle tissue, indicating a possible role in cardiac function, although its specific functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The protein is typically localized in the cytoplasm, where it may influence cellular signaling pathways and responses to external stimuli, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Function
ASB18 is a member of the ankyrin repeat SOCS box (ASB) gene family, which plays a role in various cellular processes through its involvement in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination. The ASB18 protein contains ankyrin repeat domains that facilitate binding to other proteins, potentially targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, cell cycle, and apoptosis (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB18 is expressed in heart muscles, suggesting a role in cardiac function, although specific details about its function in healthy human cells are not provided in the available literature (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The protein is typically localized in the cytoplasm, where it may influence various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, contributing to maintaining cellular homeostasis. The SOCS box domain of ASB18 is associated with the regulation of signaling pathways, often modulating cellular responses to external stimuli (Anasa2018Multifaceted). While the specific molecular activities of ASB18 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its structural features suggest a role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways and cellular signaling.

## Clinical Significance
The ASB18 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ASB18 is part of a group of ASB genes that act as protective factors, associated with a good prognosis, contrasting with their role as risk genes in most other tumors (Xie2023A). In the context of HbE/β-thalassemia, genetic polymorphisms in ASB18, specifically the SNP rs756155, have been linked to the clinical diversity and severity of the disease, suggesting that variations in this gene may influence red cell membrane integrity and disease manifestations (Azman2020Genetic).

ASB18 has also been associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or cleft palate (NSCL/P) through parent-of-origin effects, particularly showing a paternal over-transmission effect, which may contribute to the etiology of NSCL/P (Gowans2021GenomeWide). In lung adenocarcinoma among young never-smokers, germline mutations in ASB18 have been identified, indicating a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Fu2022Identification). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of ASB18 across different conditions and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.
