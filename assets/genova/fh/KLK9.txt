# KLK9

## Overview
KLK9 is a gene that encodes the protein kallikrein-related peptidase 9, a member of the serine protease family known for its chymotrypsin-like enzymatic activity. This protein is involved in various physiological processes, including proteolytic pathways, and is characterized by its glycosylation, which affects its molecular mass and function (Filippou2017Biochemical). KLK9 is expressed in several tissues and is subject to regulation by ions and serine protease inhibitors, which modulate its activity and interactions (Filippou2017Biochemical). The gene exhibits multiple splice variants, contributing to its structural and functional diversity (Adamopoulos2017Molecular). Clinically, KLK9 has been associated with various cancers, where its expression levels can serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, particularly in ovarian and breast cancers (Geng2017Clinical).

## Structure
The KLK9 protein is a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is characterized as a glycosylated chymotrypsin-like enzyme. It is synthesized as a pre-pro-peptide with a molecular mass of 27.5 kDa, containing an N-terminal signal peptide and a core domain. The mature form of KLK9 is activated extracellularly (Filippou2017Biochemical). Glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification of KLK9, with three predicted glycosylation sites: 131 NLS, 166 NIS, and 211 NGT. This glycosylation contributes to the higher observed molecular mass of the protein (~42 kDa) compared to its deglycosylated form (~25 kDa) (Filippou2017Biochemical).

KLK9 has several splice variants, which contribute to its structural diversity. Notably, some variants contain a premature termination codon and are candidates for nonsense-mediated decay. For instance, KLK9 v.2 contains only exons 1 and 5, while KLK9 v.3 lacks exons 3 and 4, resulting in a preprotein missing a large internal peptide segment (Adamopoulos2017Molecular). These splice variants may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, although their exact roles remain to be fully explored (Adamopoulos2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
KLK9, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In ovarian cancer, KLK9 expression is typically higher in early-stage and low-grade tumors, correlating with longer progression-free and overall survival. However, in advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer, KLK9 expression is low and does not show a significant association with patient outcomes (Geng2017Clinical). In breast cancer, higher KLK9 expression is associated with smaller tumor size and increased survival, suggesting a favorable prognostic role (Geng2017Clinical).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), KLK9 expression is decreased compared to normal kidney tissue, indicating its potential role in the carcinogenesis of RCC subtypes (White2010Dysregulation). The downregulation of KLK9 in RCC suggests it may serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between RCC subtypes (Dorn2013Clinical).

KLK9 is also involved in alternative splicing events, which can generate multiple transcripts with potential clinical value as cancer biomarkers (Adamopoulos2017Molecular). These findings highlight the complexity of KLK9's role in cancer and its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.

## Interactions
KLK9, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, participates in several protein interactions that influence its activity and potential physiological roles. KLK9 specifically cleaves kallikrein 10 (KLK10), as demonstrated by in vitro digestion and ELISA assays, indicating a substrate-specific interaction (Filippou2017Biochemical). KLK9's enzymatic activity is modulated by various ions; it is enhanced by Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, although these concentrations are higher than physiological levels, and inhibited by Zn2+, which may be relevant in tissues like saliva and skin where KLK9 is expressed (Filippou2017Biochemical).

KLK9 is also subject to inhibition by serine protease inhibitors such as α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and serpinC1, suggesting regulation by endogenous inhibitors (Filippou2017Biochemical). In ovarian cancer ascites, KLK9 is found bound to ACT, while in other samples like tonsil extracts, it is predominantly in its free form (Filippou2017A). The interaction with serine protease inhibitors affects the detection and quantification of KLK9 in biological samples, as these inhibitors can form heterocomplexes with KLK9, impacting its recovery in assays (Filippou2017A). These interactions highlight KLK9's potential roles in cancer and immune responses.
