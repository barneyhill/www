# ALKBH7

## Overview
ALKBH7 is a gene that encodes the protein alkB homolog 7, a member of the AlkB family of proteins. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial member of the Fe(II)/α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily, characterized by a conserved double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold. Unlike other AlkB family members, alkB homolog 7 lacks a nucleotide recognition lid, suggesting its function may involve protein substrates rather than nucleic acids (Wang2014The). The protein plays a significant role in programmed necrosis, particularly in response to DNA-damaging agents, by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death (Fu2013Human). ALKBH7's involvement in programmed necrosis and its interactions with various proteins highlight its potential therapeutic implications, especially in targeting apoptosis-resistant cancer cells (Fu2013Human). Additionally, mutations in the ALKBH7 gene have been associated with diseases such as prostate cancer, indicating its clinical significance (Walker2017ALKBH7).

## Structure
The human ALKBH7 protein is a mitochondrial member of the AlkB family, characterized by a conserved double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold typical of the Fe(II)/α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. This fold consists of 10 β-strands and four α-helices, forming a central structure with a major β-sheet and a minor β-sheet (Wang2014The). The protein crystallizes as a homotrimer, with Mn(II) ions facilitating interactions between molecules (Wang2014The). Unlike other AlkB family members, ALKBH7 lacks the 'nucleotide recognition lid', resulting in a solvent-exposed active site that suggests it may act on protein substrates rather than nucleic acids (Wang2014The).

The active center of ALKBH7 includes a unique HX(D/E)...Xn...H facial triad motif coordinating the metal ion, with Mn(II) coordinated in an octahedral manner by α-KG, a water molecule, and specific histidine and aspartate residues (Wang2014The). A post-translational modification of Leu-110, identified by mass spectrometry, indicates partial hydroxylation, which is part of the ALKBH7-α-KG complex (Wang2014The). The protein's structure also features a negatively charged surface, suggesting potential interactions with positively charged molecules (Wang2014The).

## Function
The human gene ALKBH7 encodes a protein that plays a critical role in programmed necrosis, particularly in response to DNA-damaging agents such as alkylating and oxidizing agents. ALKBH7 is involved in the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and the large-scale loss of mitochondrial function, leading to energy depletion and cell death. This process is crucial for the execution of programmed necrotic cell death under genotoxic stress conditions (Fu2013Human). Unlike other ALKBH proteins that typically protect cells by repairing DNA damage, ALKBH7 facilitates necrosis by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, initiated by PARP hyperactivation. This leads to the depletion of NAD+ and ATP, mitochondrial depolarization, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately resulting in cell death (Fu2013Human).

ALKBH7 is a nuclear-encoded protein that is imported into mitochondria, where it is processed into a truncated form. Despite its mitochondrial localization, ALKBH7 does not exhibit dioxygenase-mediated repair activity for DNA lesions, unlike other AlkB homologs. Instead, it plays a unique role in promoting cell death in response to alkylation and oxidation-induced stress (Fu2013Human). The gene's role in programmed necrosis also presents potential therapeutic implications, particularly in targeting apoptosis-resistant cancer cells (Fu2013Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ALKBH7 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, particularly prostate cancer. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7540, results in a missense mutation (R191Q) in the ALKBH7 gene. This mutation is associated with prostate cancer, showing different effects based on racial background. In European Americans, the SNP is linked to a protective effect against prostate cancer, while in African Americans, it is associated with an increased risk (Walker2017ALKBH7). The R191Q variant affects the enzyme's substrate binding, potentially impairing its enzymatic activity and contributing to cancer development (Walker2017ALKBH7).

ALKBH7 is also implicated in necrotic cell death, particularly in response to DNA alkylating agents. Its deficiency in mice leads to protection against alkylation-induced cell death, suggesting a role in programmed necrosis (Jordan2017ALKBH7). Additionally, ALKBH7 expression is linked to various cancers, with its expression levels correlating with immune response and tumor progression. High ALKBH7 expression is often associated with poor immunotherapy outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Chen2022A).

## Interactions
ALKBH7 is a mitochondrial protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, primarily within the context of programmed necrosis and fat metabolism. It is known to interact with heat shock proteins such as HSPA1A, HSPD1, DNAJA3, HSPA5, HSPA8, and HSPA9, as well as 28S ribosomal proteins including MRPS7, MRPS15, MRPS23, MRPS26, MRPS27, MRPS31, and DAP3. These interactions suggest a role in protein homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Meng2019The).

The protein-protein interaction analysis indicates that ALKBH7 may form complexes or engage in regulatory interactions that influence cellular processes such as the citric acid cycle, lipid metabolism, and immune function. ALKBH7 also regulates the expression of proteins like PTMA, PTMS, UQCRH, HMGN1, and HMGN2, which are involved in cell proliferation, lipid metabolism, and programmed necrosis (Meng2019The).

Despite these interactions, ALKBH7 does not appear to interact with nucleic acids in the same manner as other AlkB family members, due to its lack of a nucleotide recognition lid and a negatively charged surface that repels nucleic acids (Wang2014The). The specific substrates and detailed mechanisms of ALKBH7's interactions remain subjects for further research.
