# ZNF324

## Overview
ZNF324 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 324, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 324 is characterized by its involvement in regulating gene expression through DNA methylation and transcriptional repression, particularly in testis-specific gene expression and HIV-1 transcriptional repression (Kitamura2007Analysis; Randolph2022KAP1TRIM28:). The protein's ability to bind specific DNA motifs within mitochondrial differentially methylated regions further implicates it in mitochondrial gene regulation (Lees2023The). Additionally, ZNF324's zinc finger domains can be engineered to alter its regulatory functions, demonstrating its potential utility in transcription factor reprogramming (Ichikawa2023A). Despite its diverse roles, the precise functions of ZNF324 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
ZNF324 is a zinc finger protein that plays a role in regulating gene expression through its involvement in DNA methylation patterns. It is associated with tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (TDMs) that are hypomethylated in the testis and hypermethylated in other tissues, correlating with testis-specific expression (Kitamura2007Analysis). This suggests that ZNF324 may be involved in testis-specific gene expression, although its precise function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Kitamura2007Analysis).

ZNF324 is also implicated in the transcriptional repression of HIV-1, where it acts as a potential transcriptional repressor of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. This repression is significant, as ZNF324, along with other zinc finger proteins, can suppress HIV-1 LTR activity by more than 50% when over-expressed in certain cell lines (Randolph2022KAP1TRIM28:; Nishitsuji2015ZNF10). The protein's role in this context highlights its potential function in viral transcriptional repression, although its specific activities in healthy cells remain less clear. Overall, ZNF324's involvement in DNA methylation and transcriptional repression suggests it plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF324 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions with nucleic acids and potentially other proteins. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression by binding to specific DNA motifs within mitochondrial differentially methylated regions (mtDMRs). These motifs are associated with the binding of transcription factors and are conserved across diverse species, indicating their functional importance in mitochondrial gene regulation (Lees2023The).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial DNA binding, ZNF324 has been studied in the context of transcription factor reprogramming. The zinc finger domains of ZNF324 can be replaced with designed zinc finger arrays to modulate its regulatory functions. This reprogramming allows ZNF324 to act as a repressor when its natural zinc finger domains are substituted with tetO-binding zinc finger arrays. The specificity and regulatory activity of these reprogrammed transcription factors are influenced by the zinc finger arrays, which dictate off-target activity and binding affinity (Ichikawa2023A).

These interactions highlight the dual role of ZNF324 in both mitochondrial gene regulation and as a modifiable component in transcription factor engineering, underscoring its versatility in gene expression modulation.
