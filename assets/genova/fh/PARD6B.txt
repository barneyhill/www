# PARD6B

## Overview
PARD6B is a gene that encodes the par-6 family cell polarity regulator beta, a protein integral to the regulation of cell polarity. This protein is a member of the PAR-6 family and plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of cell polarity, particularly in epithelial cells. It is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain and a CRIB domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as Cdc42, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and PARD3, forming complexes essential for cellular organization and function (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Vinot2005Asymmetric). PARD6B is involved in critical cellular processes, including the regulation of the Akt signaling pathway and the maintenance of tight junctions, which are crucial for epithelial barrier function (Marques2015Par6G; Wang2021A). Its expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, where alterations in PARD6B are associated with various cancers, including breast and thyroid cancers (Tuccilli2017Expression; Marques2015Par6G). Additionally, PARD6B is essential for proper embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the trophectoderm in preimplantation embryos (Alarcon2010Cell).

## Structure
PARD6B is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell polarity regulation. It contains several important domains that facilitate its function. The protein includes a PDZ domain, a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, and a semi-CRIB domain. These domains are essential for protein-protein interactions, allowing PARD6B to interact with other proteins such as Cdc42, aPKCs, and PARD3 (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Vinot2005Asymmetric). The PDZ domain is involved in binding to other proteins, contributing to the formation of protein complexes that are critical for establishing cell polarity (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical).

PARD6B is approximately 40 kDa in molecular weight and is encoded by the Pard6b gene, which is the most prevalent in mammalian neurons (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Vinot2005Asymmetric). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in establishing cell polarity, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate its activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical). The protein's interactions and localization are vital for its function in processes like neuronal polarization and blastocyst morphogenesis (Vinot2005Asymmetric; Alarcon2010Cell).

## Function
PARD6B is a key regulator of cell polarity and is involved in several critical cellular processes. It is part of the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, which is essential for maintaining epithelial cell polarity and structure. This complex plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, which are crucial for epithelial barrier function and tissue organization (Marques2015Par6G; Alarcon2010Cell). PARD6B interacts with proteins such as aPKC and Cdc42, contributing to the establishment of apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells (Wang2021A; Martin2021New).

In healthy human cells, PARD6B is involved in regulating the Akt signaling pathway, which is important for controlling cell proliferation. It negatively regulates this pathway by controlling the phosphorylation of Akt, thereby suppressing cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors (Marques2015Par6G). PARD6B is also implicated in the regulation of the Myc oncogene, where its knockdown, in combination with Myc activation, leads to increased proliferative activity (Marques2015Par6G).

PARD6B is active at the cell membrane and is crucial for proper tissue morphogenesis, including lumen formation in epithelial cells (Wang2021A). Its role in maintaining cell polarity and regulating signaling pathways underscores its importance in cellular organization and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PARD6B gene have been implicated in various cancers. In epithelial cancers, PARD6B is often involved in gene amplifications and upregulation, particularly in breast cancer, where it is enriched in gain-of-function categories (Marques2015Par6G). This upregulation can disrupt normal cell cycle control and contribute to oncogenic processes, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Marques2015Par6G). 

In thyroid cancer, specifically papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the expression of PARD6B is deregulated compared to normal tissues. The BRAF V600E mutation in PTC is associated with increased PARD6B gene transcription, suggesting a link between this mutation and altered PARD6B expression (Tuccilli2017Expression). 

In the context of embryonic development, PARD6B is essential for proper trophectoderm formation in preimplantation mouse embryos. Knockdown of PARD6B leads to cavitation failure due to abnormal epithelial junctions and defective paracellular permeability, which may have implications for understanding developmental disorders or fertility issues (Alarcon2010Cell). These findings underscore the importance of PARD6B in maintaining epithelial structure and regulating cell proliferation, with potential implications for cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
PARD6B, a member of the PAR-6 family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cell polarity. It interacts with the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, linking them to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms such as PKCι/λ and PKCζ. This interaction is facilitated by the PDZ domain and a CRIB-like motif in PARD6B, forming a ternary complex crucial for cell polarization processes (Noda2001Human).

PARD6B also forms a quaternary complex with Cdc42, Par3, and aPKC, which is significant for establishing cell polarity and maintaining tight junctions in epithelial cells. The PDZ domain of PARD6B is essential for its interaction with Par3, and mutations in this domain can affect these interactions (Joberty2000The).

In the context of early mouse embryo development, PARD6B localizes at the apical pole of cells and is involved in the formation of tight junctions, interacting with proteins like ZO-1 and potentially forming a complex with aPKC and PARD3 (Vinot2005Asymmetric). These interactions highlight PARD6B's role as a central adaptor in cell polarity signaling pathways.
