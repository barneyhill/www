# GML

## Overview
The GML gene encodes a protein known as the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored molecule like, which is categorized as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including modulation of chemosensitivity and apoptosis, particularly in cancer cells. GML has been studied for its role in enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, making it a potential biomarker for predicting treatment response and prognosis in several types of cancer, such as lung, colorectal, and esophageal cancers (Kimura1997GML; Hashimoto2001The; Wang2023A). The expression of GML is associated with favorable clinical outcomes, and its modulation could provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The GML gene has been identified as having significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its role in modulating chemosensitivity and prognosis. In lung cancer, GML expression has been associated with favorable prognosis, serving as a prognostic marker for overall survival. A study involving lung adenocarcinoma samples found that GML was the only gene significantly associated with overall survival, leading to the development of a clinical risk score incorporating GML expression to stratify patients into risk groups (Wang2023A).

In colorectal cancer, GML expression has been linked to increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC). Research has shown that introducing GML into colorectal cancer cell lines lacking its expression enhanced their sensitivity to MMC, suggesting GML's potential as a predictor of chemosensitivity (Hashimoto2001The). The gene's expression is also associated with sensitivity to other anticancer drugs, including bleomycin and cisplatin, indicating its role in DNA damage and repair pathways (Hashimoto2001The).

In esophageal cancer, GML expression has been shown to increase sensitivity to Taxol by inducing apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for predicting treatment response and improving chemotherapy effectiveness (Kimura1997GML).
