# CFAP65

## Overview
CFAP65 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 65, a transmembrane protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. This protein is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a critical role in the development and motility of sperm by facilitating the formation and assembly of the sperm flagellum (Zhang2019A). Structurally, CFAP65 contains several domains, including a transmembrane helix, an ASPM-SPD-2-Hydin (ASH) domain, a major sperm protein (MSP) domain, and a coiled-coil region, which are essential for its function in sperm development (Wang2019Biallelic). Beyond its reproductive role, CFAP65 is also expressed in ciliated tissues such as the brain, lung, and kidney, suggesting a broader involvement in ciliary functions (Wang2019Biallelic). Mutations in the CFAP65 gene are linked to male infertility and conditions resembling primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2019Biallelic). Additionally, CFAP65 expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in colon cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Li2024The).

## Structure
The CFAP65 protein, encoded by the CFAP65 gene, is speculated to be a transmembrane protein with several distinct structural domains. Near the N-terminus, it features a transmembrane helix region, which is crucial for its integration into cellular membranes (Wang2019Biallelic). The protein also contains an ASPM-SPD-2-Hydin (ASH) domain, a major sperm protein (MSP) domain, and a coiled-coil region near the C-terminus. These domains are essential for the protein's function in sperm development and motility (Wang2019Biallelic).

Mutations in CFAP65 can lead to premature translation termination, resulting in truncated proteins that disrupt these structural domains. For instance, certain mutations eliminate the MSP domain and coiled-coil region, severely impairing the protein's function (Wang2019Biallelic). The protein is localized in the acrosome area and flagellar midpiece of spermatozoa, indicating its role in acrosome formation and flagellum assembly (Wang2019Biallelic).

CFAP65 is highly expressed in the testes, particularly during spermiogenesis, underscoring its importance in sperm development (Wang2019Biallelic). The protein's structure and localization suggest it plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and function of sperm flagella.

## Function
CFAP65, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 65, plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the testis and is essential for the formation and assembly of the sperm flagellum, which is vital for sperm motility (Zhang2019A). CFAP65 is localized in the acrosome and flagellar midpiece of spermatozoa, indicating its involvement in acrosome formation and flagellum assembly (Wang2019Biallelic). The protein contains a transmembrane helix region, an ASPM-SPD-2-Hydin (ASH) domain, a major sperm protein (MSP) domain, and a coiled-coil region, which are important for its function in these processes (Wang2019Biallelic).

In addition to its role in reproductive cells, CFAP65 is expressed in certain ciliated organs such as the brain, lung, and kidney, suggesting its involvement in ciliary functions beyond reproduction (Wang2019Biallelic). The protein is implicated in calcium-mediated retrograde signaling, which affects cell differentiation and proliferation, and may mediate the anchoring of mitochondria and acrosomes to the outer dense fibers or nuclear membrane, forming part of the cytoskeleton (Wang2019Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP65 gene are associated with severe asthenoteratospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility and morphological abnormalities, including malformed sperm heads and flagella. This condition is linked to male infertility due to the presence of 100% immotile spermatozoa and is often accompanied by symptoms similar to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), such as chronic respiratory issues (Wang2019Biallelic). Biallelic mutations in CFAP65 lead to significant morphological abnormalities in sperm, including misshapen heads and defective flagella, resulting in impaired sperm motility and male infertility (Wang2019Biallelic; Zhang2019A).

In addition to its role in male infertility, CFAP65 expression has been studied in the context of colon cancer. Higher expression levels of CFAP65 in tumor tissues have been associated with better disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for tumor progression in colon cancer (Li2024The). However, CFAP65 expression does not significantly correlate with other clinical parameters such as age, gender, or tumor stage (Li2024The). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of CFAP65 in both reproductive health and cancer prognosis.
