# DHX38

## Overview
The DHX38 gene encodes the DEAH-box helicase 38, a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, which are integral to RNA metabolism. This protein plays a pivotal role in the pre-mRNA splicing process, a critical step in the maturation of mRNA molecules necessary for protein synthesis. As a component of the spliceosome, DEAH-box helicase 38 facilitates the structural rearrangement and stabilization of splicing intermediates, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of intron removal from pre-mRNA. The activity of this helicase is regulated by various trans-acting proteins and post-translational modifications, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression. Mutations in the DHX38 gene have been associated with diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Abdelhaleem2003The; Obuća2022Retinitis; Li2023DHX38).

## Function
DHX38, also known as DEAH-box helicase 38, is a crucial component in the process of pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. This protein is part of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, which are involved in various steps of RNA metabolism, particularly in the formation and function of the spliceosome. The spliceosome is responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, leading to the formation of mature mRNA molecules that are essential for protein synthesis (Abdelhaleem2003The; 1).

In healthy human cells, DHX38 facilitates the structural rearrangement and stabilization of reaction intermediates during splicing, ensuring the fidelity and directionality of this process. It plays a role in protein displacement and the resolution of RNA structures, which are critical for the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome (1 page 7 of 30). The activity of DHX38 is regulated by trans-acting proteins and post-translational modifications, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient gene expression (1 page 7 of 30).

DHX38 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the maturation of mRNA, impacting cellular protein synthesis and overall organismal development (Abdelhaleem2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHX38 gene have been linked to early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with macular coloboma. A specific missense mutation, c.995G>A; p.(Gly332Asp), has been identified in affected individuals, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and complete blindness due to retinal degeneration. This mutation is thought to impair protein function by altering the flexibility of the glycine residue, introducing a charge, and causing sterical hindrance, which affects the splicing activity crucial for retinal cell function (Ajmal2014A).

Research has shown that the G332D mutation in DHX38 modulates its splicing activity, particularly affecting retina-specific genes like Rhodopsin (RHO) and Fascin actin-bundling protein 2 (FSCN2). This mutation inhibits RHO splicing and promotes the use of cryptic splice sites, contributing to the pathogenesis of RP (Obuća2022Retinitis).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DHX38 is involved in regulating the alternative splicing of the RELL2 gene. Altered expression of DHX38 affects intron retention in RELL2, influencing PDAC progression and chemoresistance. Overexpression of DHX38 promotes normal splicing of RELL2, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC (Li2023DHX38).

## Interactions
DHX38, a DEAH-box RNA helicase, is primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with components of the spliceosome, such as U2 and U5 snRNPs, facilitating the unwinding of RNA structures during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. The study of DHX38 in the context of retinitis pigmentosa involved immunoprecipitation experiments to explore its interactions. Plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant DHX38 proteins were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the DHX38 protein was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. This suggests that the study investigated the physical interactions of DHX38 with other proteins or nucleic acids, although specific interactions were not detailed (Obuća2022Retinitis).

The DEAH/RHA helicases, including DHX38, are involved in RNA metabolism and genome stability. These helicases translocate along single-stranded RNA in a 3' to 5' direction, driven by cycling between NTP-bound and NDP-bound conformations. DHX38 is specifically involved in pre-mRNA splicing and chromosome segregation, but the excerpt does not provide detailed information about its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (1a page 2 of 34).
