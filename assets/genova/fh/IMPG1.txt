# IMPG1

## Overview
The IMPG1 gene encodes the interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1, a crucial component of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) in the retina. This glycosylated proteoglycan, also known as IPM 150, plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the IPM, which is essential for retinal adhesion and photoreceptor survival. The protein is characterized by its mucin-like domain, EGF-like domain, and SEA domains, which are involved in proteolytic processing necessary for its maturation and function. IMPG1 interacts with another proteoglycan, IMPG2, and this interaction is vital for their proper localization within the IPM. Mutations in the IMPG1 gene have been linked to various retinal diseases, including vitelliform macular dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its importance in visual health (Olivier2022SPACR; Kuehn1999Expression; Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor).

## Structure
The IMPG1 protein, encoded by the IMPG1 gene, is a heavily glycosylated proteoglycan associated with the interphotoreceptor matrix in the retina. It contains chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 89 kDa. However, due to glycosylation, it migrates at around 150 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels (Kuehn1999Expression; Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). The protein undergoes intramolecular proteolysis at the SEA-2 domain, resulting in fragments of 71 and 18 kDa (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor).

The molecular structure of IMPG1 includes a central mucin-like domain, a carboxy-terminal EGF-like domain, and two SEA domains. The SEA domains are involved in proteolysis, with the SEA-2 domain being proteolytic (Olivier2022SPACR; Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). The amino terminal domain contains three consensus sites for potential N-linked glycosylation and one site for hyaluronan binding (Kuehn1999Expression).

IMPG1 does not possess hydrophobic regions that might constitute transmembrane domains, suggesting it is released into the interphotoreceptor space (Kuehn1999Expression). The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested by the absence of 234 nucleotides in certain clones, although these differences are not distinguishable on Northern blot analyses (Kuehn1999Expression).

## Function
The IMPG1 gene encodes a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan known as IPM 150, which is a major component of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) in the human retina. This matrix occupies the extracellular space between the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and the neural retina, playing a crucial role in retinal adhesion and photoreceptor survival (Kuehn1999Expression). IPM 150 is expressed by rod and cone photoreceptor cells and is involved in mediating functional interactions between the neural retina and the RPE, including the exchange of metabolites and regulation of the ionic environment (Kuehn1999Expression).

The protein is heavily glycosylated and contains domains for potential N-linked glycosylation and hyaluronan binding, suggesting its involvement in photoreceptor survival and retinal adhesion (Kuehn1999Expression). IMPG1 undergoes intramolecular proteolysis, particularly at the SEA-2 domain, which is crucial for its maturation and function in the retina (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). The localization of IMPG1 in the retina is dependent on the presence of IMPG2, indicating a mutual dependency between these two proteoglycans for proper localization and function in photoreceptor cells (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). This proteolytic processing and localization are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the IPM, contributing to the overall health and viability of photoreceptor cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IMPG1 gene are associated with several retinal diseases, including vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). VMD is characterized by central visual loss and the accumulation of autofluorescent material in the macular subretinal space, while RP is marked by bone-spicule pigment deposits in the peripheral retina, attenuated retinal blood vessels, night blindness, and progressive visual field loss (Olivier2022SPACR). The IMPG1 gene has also been linked to autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (ADSTGD), North Carolina macular dystrophy (MCDR1), and progressive bifocal chorioretinal atrophy (PBCRA) (Gehrig1998Assessment).

Research using Impg1 knockout mouse models has shown that the absence of the SPACR protein, encoded by IMPG1, leads to retinal degeneration. This degeneration is characterized by the accumulation of cellular debris and lipid droplets at the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) interface, as well as the formation of abnormal autofluorescent deposits and photoreceptor layer degeneration (Olivier2022SPACR). These findings suggest that IMPG1 is crucial for maintaining retinal structure and function, and its disruption can lead to significant visual impairment (Olivier2022SPACR).

## Interactions
IMPG1, also known as interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1, is involved in crucial interactions within the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) of the retina. It interacts with another proteoglycan, IMPG2, and this interaction is essential for their proper localization within the IPM. The proteolysis of IMPG1 and IMPG2 in their SEA domains is a key process for their maturation and function. This proteolytic process generates 'sticky' ends that may facilitate non-covalent interactions, potentially forming a heterodimeric complex between IMPG1 and IMPG2. This interaction is hypothesized to be necessary for the trafficking and distribution of these proteins to the outer segment region of photoreceptor cells (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor).

The localization of the extracellular portion of IMPG2 is dependent on the presence of IMPG1. In the absence of IMPG1, IMPG2 mislocalizes, indicating a mutual dependency between these proteins for proper localization within photoreceptor cells (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). This co-dependent relationship suggests that mutations affecting one of these proteoglycans can impact the localization and function of the other, contributing to the pathology of vision diseases (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor).
