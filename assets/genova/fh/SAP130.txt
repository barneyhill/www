# SAP130

## Overview
SAP130 is a gene that encodes the Sin3A associated protein 130, a critical component of the mSin3A-histone deacetylase corepressor complex. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional repression, chromatin remodeling, and gene silencing, which are essential processes for regulating cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (Chen2024Sumoylation; Adams2018Co-repressor). As a nuclear protein, Sin3A associated protein 130 functions as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other proteins, such as Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1), in a SUMO-dependent manner (Chen2024Sumoylation). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications like sumoylation, which influence its stability and interaction with other cellular components (Chen2024Sumoylation). SAP130's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis (DeMoya2023Sin3a; Lv2021SAP130).

## Function
SAP130, also known as Sin3A associated protein 130, is a component of the mSin3A-histone deacetylase corepressor complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression in human cells. This protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing by interacting with histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby influencing cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (Chen2024Sumoylation; Adams2018Co-repressor).

SAP130 is modified by sumoylation, a post-translational modification that affects its protein stability and transcriptional repressor function. Sumoylation occurs at specific lysine residues and is essential for SAP130's interaction with other proteins, such as FAF1 (Fas-associated factor 1), which regulates its stability and degradation through the proteasome pathway (Chen2024Sumoylation). This modification also enhances SAP130's ability to repress transcription and promote cell proliferation (Chen2024Sumoylation).

SAP130 is active in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor by being part of the Sin3A corepressor complex. This complex is involved in regulating gene transcription, particularly in pathways involving nuclear hormone receptors and NF-κB signaling (Chen2024Sumoylation). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and regulating cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
SAP130, also known as Sin3A associated protein 130, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Alterations in SAP130 expression or its interactions have been linked to several conditions. In the context of congenital heart diseases, SAP130 mutations have been associated with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) in mouse models, and similar phenotypes have been observed in zebrafish with sap130a mutations, indicating its critical role in heart development (DeMoya2023Sin3a). In acute kidney injury (AKI), SAP130 is released from damaged tubular epithelial cells and acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), triggering necroinflammation through the miR-219c/Mincle signaling pathway. This process is implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI, highlighting SAP130's role in renal inflammation (Lv2021SAP130).

In cancer, SAP130's interaction with Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) is regulated by sumoylation, affecting its protein stability and transcriptional repressor function. Alterations in this interaction have been observed in several cancer types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and prostate adenocarcinoma, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Chen2024Sumoylation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SAP130 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SAP130, also known as Sin3A associated protein 130, is a component of the mSin3A corepressor complex and interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression. It is known to interact with Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) in a SUMO-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for SAP130's function as a transcriptional repressor, and mutations that prevent sumoylation reduce its interaction with FAF1 (Chen2024Sumoylation). SAP130 also interacts with cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, acting as a cullin binding protein. It binds to multiple cullins, primarily through the cullin C-terminal domain, and is involved in polyubiquitination activity regulated by the COP9 signalosome (CSN) (Menon2008Association). 

SAP130 is part of the chromatin modifying SIN3A/HDAC complex, which plays a role in transcriptional repression. It interacts with other components of this complex, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), to modify chromatin structure and regulate gene expression (DeMoya2023Sin3a). Despite its interactions with FAF1 and CRL complexes, SAP130's association with mSin3A is not SUMO-dependent, indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms for its interactions (Chen2024Sumoylation).
