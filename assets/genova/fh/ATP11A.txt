# ATP11A

## Overview
ATP11A is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 11A protein, a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein is integral to maintaining the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and various physiological functions, including cell signaling and apoptosis (Sakuragi2023Regulation; Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP11A, in conjunction with CDC50 proteins, facilitates the translocation of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby preventing their exposure on the cell surface (HawkeyNoble2020Expression). The protein's activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels and is modulated during apoptosis to signal phagocytosis (Sakuragi2023Regulation). Mutations in ATP11A have been implicated in neurological disorders and hearing loss, underscoring its critical role in normal cellular and developmental processes (Pater2022Autosomal; Segawa2021A).

## Structure
ATP11A is a member of the P4-ATPase family, characterized by a large polypeptide structure with a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. The protein is composed of four main domains: the nucleotide (N-domain), phosphorylation (P-domain), actuator (A-domain), and membrane (M-domain) (Andersen2016P4ATPases). The M-domain contains 10 transmembrane segments, with segments M1-M6 forming the principal unit for phospholipid transport and M7-M10 playing a supporting role (Andersen2016P4ATPases).

ATP11A functions as a phospholipid flippase, maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane by translocating phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the outer to the inner leaflet (HawkeyNoble2020Expression). It forms a heteromeric complex with CDC50 family proteins, which are essential for its function, including ATP hydrolysis and phospholipid exchange (HawkeyNoble2020Expression).

The protein's structure is further influenced by specific mutations, such as the Q84E mutation, which alters substrate specificity and allows the translocation of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), a function not observed in the wild-type ATP11A (Segawa2021A). This mutation results in a stronger binding affinity for PtdCho due to the formation of a salt bridge between the choline moiety and the E84 residue (Segawa2021A).

## Function
ATP11A encodes a P4-ATPase that functions as a phospholipid flippase, primarily involved in maintaining the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the plasma membrane of human cells (Pater2022Autosomal; Sakuragi2023Regulation). This asymmetry is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, membrane stability, and apoptosis (Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP11A translocates PtdSer from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, preventing its exposure on the cell surface, which is important for processes like synapse pruning and avoiding unwanted immune responses (Sakuragi2023Regulation).

In healthy cells, ATP11A forms a complex with CDC50A, which acts as a chaperone to localize ATP11A to the plasma membrane (Sakuragi2023Regulation). The flippase activity of ATP11A is regulated by intracellular calcium levels and is inactivated during apoptosis by caspase 3 cleavage, allowing PtdSer exposure as an 'eat me' signal for phagocytes (Sakuragi2023Regulation). ATP11A is also involved in the formation of syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta, and its absence can lead to embryonic lethality (Sakuragi2023Regulation). The gene's function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing pathological conditions (Pater2022Autosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP11A gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily involving neurological deterioration and hearing loss. A specific sublethal mutation, Q84E, in ATP11A is associated with severe neurological deterioration. This mutation causes aberrant phosphatidylcholine flipping in plasma membranes, leading to altered lipid distribution and synthesis, particularly affecting sphingomyelin levels. These changes result in developmental delays, neurological decline, and perinatal death in mice models, highlighting the mutation's severe impact on development and brain function (Segawa2021A).

In addition to neurological issues, ATP11A mutations are also associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. Variants such as a novel splice site mutation and a frameshift duplication in exon 28 have been identified in families with progressive hearing loss. These mutations disrupt normal RNA splicing and protein structure, potentially through dominant-negative or haploinsufficiency mechanisms, leading to auditory dysfunction (Pater2021Autosomal).

The ATP11A gene's role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry is crucial for normal cellular function, and disruptions can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including neurological and auditory conditions (Segawa2021A).

## Interactions
ATP11A interacts with CDC50 proteins, which are essential for its function as a phospholipid flippase. Specifically, ATP11A forms a complex with CDC50A, a β-subunit that acts as a chaperone to facilitate ATP11A's proper folding, ER exit, and functional activity. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a functional P4-ATPase complex, enabling ATP11A to perform its role in phospholipid translocation across cellular membranes (Sakuragi2023Regulation; Andersen2016P4ATPases).

The presence of TMEM30A is also significant for ATP11A's correct localization. Without TMEM30A, ATP11A is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. However, coexpression with TMEM30A allows ATP11A to exit the ER and localize to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, indicating TMEM30A's role in ATP11A's proper cellular localization (Sun2020Disease).

Mutations in ATP11A, such as Y300F and D913K, can disrupt its interaction with TMEM30A, leading to improper localization and reduced phosphatidylserine internalization. These mutations highlight the importance of specific residues in ATP11A for its interaction with TMEM30A and its functional activity (Sun2020Disease).
