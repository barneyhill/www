# DNAJB13

## Overview
DNAJB13 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B13, which is a member of the Hsp40 family of molecular chaperones. This protein plays a critical role in the development and function of the sperm flagellum, particularly through its interaction with SEPT4, a component of the sperm annulus (Guan2009Spatiotemporal). DNAJB13 is involved in the assembly and positioning of the sperm annulus, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm flagellum (Guan2009Spatiotemporal). Mutations in the DNAJB13 gene have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia and male infertility, highlighting its importance in ciliary and sperm function (Bai2023DNAJB7; Li2022Differential). Additionally, DNAJB13 has been implicated in cancer, with altered expression patterns observed in colon adenocarcinoma and breast cancer, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Gene; Lu2020&lt; p&gt; FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DNAJB13 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Notably, mutations in DNAJB13 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by defects in the action of cilia, leading to respiratory issues and male infertility due to impaired sperm motility (Bai2023DNAJB7; Li2022Differential). The gene's role in male infertility is further underscored by its involvement in sperm cilia formation, where mutations can result in teratozoospermia, a condition affecting sperm shape and function (Bai2023DNAJB7).

In the context of cancer, DNAJB13 has been identified as part of a 9-gene signature associated with colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). Its expression is increased in colon cancer tissues, and it is considered a risk factor, with high expression levels correlating with a higher risk of poor prognosis in COAD patients (Gene; Lu2020&lt; p&gt). Additionally, DNAJB13 exhibits copy number variations (CNVs) in breast cancer, specifically amplified CNVs, which are associated with changes in mRNA expression levels, potentially impacting cancer progression (FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
DNAJB13, a type II HSP40, is known to interact with SEPT4, a component of the sperm annulus, during the development of the sperm flagellum. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where FLAG-tagged SEPT4 was co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-tagged DNAJB13 using an anti-GFP antibody. This suggests a direct interaction between DNAJB13 and SEPT4, which is consistent across different cell lines, including HeLa S3, U2OS, and CHO cells (Guan2009Spatiotemporal). DNAJB13 is proposed to interact with SEPT4 via its homodimers, as it can form homodimers in HeLa S3 cells (Guan2009Spatiotemporal).

The interaction between DNAJB13 and SEPT4 is crucial for the assembly and positioning of the sperm annulus, a septin-based structure essential for the structural integrity of the sperm flagellum. DNAJB13's presence in the annulus is first detected in step 9 spermatids and increases as spermiogenesis progresses, although it disappears in late stages (Guan2009Spatiotemporal). In Sept4-null mice, DNAJB13 still appears in an annulus-like pattern, albeit weaker, indicating its role in annulus assembly and positioning (Guan2009Spatiotemporal).
