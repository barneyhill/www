# EMB

## Overview
The EMB gene encodes embigin, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Embigin is characterized by its single-pass membrane structure and extensive N-glycosylation, which is essential for its functional interactions and molecular weight. This protein plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including the growth of motor neurons, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism in the brain. It acts as an accessory protein for monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), facilitating the transport of lactic acid between glial cells and neurons, which is crucial for cognitive functions. Additionally, embigin is involved in cell adhesion and migration, interacting with integrins and other proteins such as S100A4 and galectin-3. Its expression in both embryonic and adult tissues underscores its importance in development and adult physiology (Fairweather2020Heteromeric; Ruma2018Embigin; Zhou2020Rare).

## Structure
Embigin is a type I single-pass membrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features a short intracellular C-terminal, a single transmembrane α-helix, and a larger extracellular glycosylated N-terminal domain containing two immunoglobulin folds (Fairweather2020Heteromeric). The protein has two expressed isoforms: isoform 1, consisting of 327 residues, and isoform 2, consisting of 277 residues (Fairweather2020Heteromeric). Unlike basigin, another member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, embigin's longer isoform does not contain an additional immunoglobulin domain (Fairweather2020Heteromeric).

Embigin is extensively N-glycosylated, which significantly affects its molecular weight and is crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins (Fairweather2020Heteromeric). This glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that plays a role in the formation and function of heteromeric complexes (Fairweather2020Heteromeric). The embigin gene is located on chromosome 5 in humans and contains 9 exons (Fairweather2020Heteromeric). The protein's structure and interactions are important for its role in cancer progression, particularly in prostate cancer, where it interacts with proteins like S100A4 and is involved in various signaling pathways (Ruma2018Embigin).

## Function
The EMB gene encodes embigin, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Embigin is highly glycosylated and plays a significant role in the growth of motor neurons and the formation of neuromuscular junctions. It facilitates nerve terminal sprouting and the formation of additional acetylcholine receptor clusters at synaptic sites following muscle denervation, and it delays the retraction of terminal sprouts after re-innervation. This suggests its involvement in synaptic plasticity and repair mechanisms (Zhou2020Rare).

Embigin also acts as an accessory protein for monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), which is involved in the transport of lactic acid between glial cells and neurons. This function is crucial for brain energy metabolism and long-term memory formation, highlighting embigin's role in cognitive processes (Zhou2020Rare). Additionally, embigin enhances integrin-mediated cell matrix adhesion, indicating its involvement in cell migration and tissue development (Zhou2020Rare). Embigin is expressed in early embryos and adult tissues such as the heart, lung, and brain, suggesting its importance in both developmental and adult physiological processes (Zhou2020Rare).

## Interactions
Embigin (EMB) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is a primary ancillary protein for monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) and may assist other MCTs (1, 3, and 4) in transporting molecules like L-lactate and pyruvate to the plasma membrane. Embigin interacts directly with carbonic anhydrase IV (CA IV), a metalloenzyme that facilitates MCT transport activities (Talvi2021Embigin).

Embigin also plays a role in regulating cell adhesion by modifying integrin function and has been reported to interact with galectin-3 and S100A4 protein (Talvi2021Embigin). It is identified as a bone marrow stem cell niche factor, specifically regulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell quiescence (Talvi2021Embigin).

In the context of cardiac actin gene expression, the Emb protein, a class VI POU domain protein, forms complexes with MEF2D and the histone transacetylase p300. These interactions are significant for transcriptional regulation, as p300 enhances transcriptional activation by MEF2D. Emb binds to an AT-rich sequence in the cardiac actin enhancer, and its interaction with MEF2D and p300 is crucial for the activity of the enhancer (Molinari2004A).
