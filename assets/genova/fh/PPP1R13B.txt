# PPP1R13B

## Overview
PPP1R13B is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 13B, commonly referred to as ASPP1. ASPP1 is a regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in apoptosis regulation and tumor suppression. It is primarily known for its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing p53's ability to activate pro-apoptotic genes, thereby promoting programmed cell death. This function is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells, where ASPP1 is preferentially expressed. Beyond its interaction with p53, ASPP1 also engages with other proteins such as p63, p73, and Yes-associated protein (YAP), indicating its involvement in both p53-dependent and independent apoptotic pathways. The protein's regulatory functions underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation; Yamashita2015Aspp1).

## Function
PPP1R13B, also known as ASPP1, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 that plays a significant role in apoptosis regulation. It interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its transcriptional activity on pro-apoptotic target genes, thereby promoting apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where ASPP1 is preferentially expressed. In these cells, ASPP1 helps preserve the HSC pool by coordinating with p53 to regulate apoptosis and DNA damage response, ensuring the removal of damaged cells and maintaining normal cellular processes (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation; Yamashita2015Aspp1).

ASPP1 is active in the nucleus and is involved in cell cycle control and tumor suppression. It has been shown to have p53-independent functions as well, interacting with other proteins such as p63, p73, and Yes-associated protein (YEP), which positions ASPP1 as a central regulator of apoptosis (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation). The protein's role in apoptosis and its interactions with key cellular homeostasis regulators underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP1R13B gene, also known as ASPP1, have been implicated in various hematological malignancies and other diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), reduced expression of PPP1R13B is associated with higher risk profiles and therapy resistance, particularly in patients who do not achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy. Lower PPP1R13B expression levels are linked to poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for therapy resistance and overall survival in AML (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation). 

In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), PPP1R13B, in conjunction with p53, plays a crucial role in preventing malignant transformation. Deficiency in PPP1R13B, especially when combined with p53 deficiency, can lead to the development of hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia and B cell lymphoblastic leukemia (Yamashita2015Aspp1). 

In the context of silicosis, a fibrotic lung disease, PPP1R13B expression is upregulated in response to silica exposure, suggesting a role in the fibrotic response through mechanisms involving endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy (Cheng2019CircRNA012091PPP1R13B–mediated). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various pathological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PPP1R13B, also known as ASPP1, is a member of the ASPP family of proteins that interact with key regulators of cellular homeostasis. One of its primary interactions is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. ASPP1 enhances the apoptotic function of p53 by stimulating its transactivation of proapoptotic target genes, thereby promoting apoptosis in response to cellular stress (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, particularly in hematopoietic stem cells, where ASPP1 is predominantly expressed (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation).

ASPP1 also interacts with other proteins involved in apoptosis, such as members of the BCL-2 family, which are key regulators of cell survival pathways (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation). These interactions suggest that ASPP1 plays a significant role in modulating apoptosis and cell proliferation, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its expression is often reduced, leading to therapy resistance and poorer survival outcomes (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation).

In addition to its p53-dependent roles, ASPP1 has been shown to interact with other proteins like p63, p73, and Yes-associated protein (YAP), indicating its involvement in p53-independent apoptotic pathways (Schittenhelm2024Evaluation). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ASPP1 in regulating apoptosis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
