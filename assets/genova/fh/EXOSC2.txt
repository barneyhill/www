# EXOSC2

## Overview
EXOSC2 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 2, a crucial structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex. This complex is a highly conserved, multisubunit riboexonuclease involved in RNA processing and degradation across eukaryotic organisms. The EXOSC2 protein, characterized by its S1 RNA-binding domain and K Homology (KH) domain, plays a vital role in the maturation and decay of various RNA species, including ribosomal RNA, small noncoding RNAs, and aberrant mRNAs. It is integral to maintaining RNA homeostasis and genome integrity by participating in RNA surveillance and degradation processes. Mutations in the EXOSC2 gene, such as Gly30Val and Gly198Asp, have been linked to SHRF syndrome, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in human health (Yang2019Genetic; Sterrett2021A; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

## Structure
The EXOSC2 protein is a component of the RNA exosome complex, which is crucial for RNA processing and degradation. It features a core domain structure that includes an S1 RNA-binding domain and a K Homology (KH) domain, both of which are essential for its function in the exosome complex (Yang2019Genetic; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). The KH domain is particularly important for RNA binding and is involved in the structural integrity of the protein (Yang2019Genetic).

The tertiary structure of EXOSC2 contributes to the formation of the exosome's ring-like quaternary structure, which is a barrel-like hexameric formation that serves as a scaffold for RNA substrates (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). This structure is highly conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its critical role in RNA metabolism (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

Mutations in EXOSC2, such as Gly30Val and Gly198Asp, can disrupt its structure and function. These mutations occur in conserved domains and are associated with the SHRF syndrome, affecting the protein's interactions within the exosome complex (Yang2019Genetic; Sterrett2021A). The Gly198Asp mutation, located in the KH domain, is known to alter the β-hairpin structure, impacting RNA binding (Yang2019Genetic).

## Function
The EXOSC2 gene encodes a structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex, a highly conserved, multisubunit riboexonuclease essential for RNA processing and decay. In healthy human cells, EXOSC2 is part of the cap subunit of the RNA exosome, which is involved in the maturation of stable RNA species and the degradation of unstable RNA in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Yang2019Genetic; Sterrett2021A). The RNA exosome plays a critical role in generating mature ribosomal RNA and processing various small noncoding RNAs, including snRNAs, snoRNAs, and tRNAs. It is also involved in RNA decay and surveillance, such as the nuclear degradation of cryptic unstable transcripts and cytoplasmic turnover of aberrant mRNAs (Sterrett2021A).

EXOSC2's function is influenced by interactions with RNA exosome cofactors, which help target distinct transcripts in different cellular compartments. These interactions are crucial for maintaining RNA homeostasis, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Sterrett2021A). The RNA exosome, including EXOSC2, is also involved in maintaining genome integrity by degrading RNA molecules that form R-loop hybrid structures, which can otherwise lead to genomic instability (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOSC2 gene are associated with a novel syndrome known as SHRF (Short stature, Hearing loss, Retinitis pigmentosa, and distinctive Facies). This syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as childhood myopia, early onset retinitis pigmentosa, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, brachydactyly, a recognizable facial gestalt, premature skin aging, mild intellectual disability, and mild cerebellar atrophy (Yang2019Genetic; Sterrett2021A). Specific missense mutations, such as EXOSC2 p.Gly30Val (G30V) and p.Gly198Asp (G198D), have been identified as causing distinct disease phenotypes. These mutations disrupt the RNA exosome's function, leading to impaired RNA processing and degradation (Sterrett2021A).

The G198D mutation, in particular, affects the stability of the EXOSC2 protein and its interactions with other RNA exosome components, resulting in lower protein levels and compromised exosome function. This mutation is more deleterious compared to G30V, which appears to be a weaker disease allele (Yang2019Genetic). Research using model organisms, such as yeast and Drosophila, has demonstrated that these mutations lead to significant transcriptomic changes and developmental defects, further implicating EXOSC2 mutations in disease pathogenesis (Yang2019Genetic; Sterrett2021A).

## Interactions
EXOSC2, a core component of the RNA exosome complex, participates in several critical interactions essential for RNA processing and degradation. It interacts with other exosome components such as EXOSC3 and EXOSC4, forming a stable complex that is crucial for its function (Yang2019Genetic). Structural modeling has shown that specific amino acid substitutions in EXOSC2, such as G30V and G198D, can disrupt its interaction with EXOSC4, potentially destabilizing the complex (Sterrett2021A). These interactions are vital for maintaining the integrity and function of the RNA exosome complex.

EXOSC2 also interacts with the essential nuclear RNA helicase Mtr4, which is involved in recruiting the helicase to the RNA exosome. This interaction is mediated by a conserved region of EXOSC2, and mutations like G198D can impair this interaction, leading to functional defects in RNA processing (Sterrett2021A). Additionally, EXOSC2 has been shown to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 viral polymerase, specifically with the Nsp8 protein, suggesting a role in viral RNA processing. This interaction is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and is not observed with SARS-CoV-1 (Moll2022Low). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EXOSC2 in both cellular and viral RNA metabolism.
