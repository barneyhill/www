# IBSP

## Overview
The IBSP gene encodes the integrin binding sialoprotein (IBSP), a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein predominantly found in bone and dentin. As a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family, IBSP plays a critical role in bone mineralization and remodeling by mediating cell adhesion and signaling through its interaction with integrins (Bellahcène2008Small; Nagasaki2022The). The protein is characterized by its strong affinity for hydroxyapatite, a mineral component of bone, and contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif essential for integrin binding, which facilitates cell attachment and migration (Stubbs1997Characterization). Beyond its role in bone physiology, IBSP is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in processes such as cell migration and invasion, highlighting its significance in both normal and pathological conditions (Chen2021IBSP; Wu2021Exosomal).

## Structure
The integrin binding sialoprotein (IBSP) is a non-collagenous protein found in the bone matrix, characterized by a primary structure rich in glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues. These acidic residues contribute to its strong affinity for hydroxyapatite, a mineral component of bone, with a dissociation constant of 2.6 x 10^-9 M (Stubbs1997Characterization). The protein contains an integrin-binding RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif, which is crucial for cell adhesion (Mintz1993Purification; Stubbs1997Characterization). 

IBSP's secondary structure includes regions of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure. The protein's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other matrix proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation enhance its mineral-binding and cell adhesion properties (Stubbs1997Characterization). 

The protein also features a tyrosine-rich domain that supports cell adhesion independently of the RGD sequence, indicating multiple functional domains within its structure (Stubbs1997Characterization). The presence of splice variant isoforms may affect its function and localization, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context.

## Function
The IBSP gene encodes bone sialoprotein (BSP), a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein primarily involved in the mineralization and maintenance of bone and dentin. BSP is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family and plays a crucial role in bone formation and remodeling by facilitating cell adhesion and signaling through its interaction with integrins (Bellahcène2008Small; Nagasaki2022The). 

BSP contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) domain, which is essential for binding to integrins, thereby mediating cell attachment and migration. This interaction is vital for the modulation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity, influencing bone growth and mineralization (Nagasaki2022The; Stubbs1997Characterization). BSP also has a strong affinity for hydroxyapatite, a mineral component of bone, which suggests its role in nucleating hydroxyapatite in the bone matrix and inhibiting crystal growth (Stubbs1997Characterization).

In addition to its RGD-dependent functions, BSP contains non-RGD cell adhesion sites, indicating multiple mechanisms for cell interaction and adhesion (Stubbs1997Characterization). These properties underscore BSP's importance in bone and tooth development, as well as in maintaining skeletal integrity (Stubbs1997Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IBSP gene have been implicated in various cancers and bone-related conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), IBSP is significantly upregulated in metastatic recurrence, with higher expression levels observed in primary CRC, metastatic CRC, and CRC patients with metastatic recurrence compared to normal colonic mucosa and non-recurrent CRC patients. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC recurrence (Chen2021IBSP). Downregulation of IBSP in CRC cell lines leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression through the Fyn/β-catenin signaling pathway (Chen2021IBSP).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) types, IBSP is associated with osteolytic bone metastasis. It acts as a chemoattractant for osteoclast precursors, promoting a bone microenvironment conducive to metastasis. The absence of IBSP significantly reduces bone-metastatic ability, highlighting its role in bone metastasis (Wu2021Exosomal).

IBSP is also overexpressed in various other cancers, including osteosarcoma, where it is linked to poor prognosis and advanced pathological stages. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Pan2023Pancancer). In bone-related diseases, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IBSP gene are associated with bone mineral density variations, potentially affecting osteoporosis pathophysiology (Alam2014SIBLING).

## Interactions
Integrin binding sialoprotein (IBSP) is involved in various physical interactions with proteins that play significant roles in cancer progression and bone mineralization. IBSP binds to integrins, particularly αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are up-regulated on activated endothelial cells, promoting cell migration, attachment, and angiogenesis (Kruger2014Bone). It also interacts with type 1 collagen and activates matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), enhancing the invasive properties of cancer cells (Kruger2014Bone; Bellahcène2008Small). IBSP binds complement factor H (CFH), protecting cells from complement-mediated lysis (Kruger2014Bone; Bellahcène2008Small).

In glioblastoma, IBSP is a key mediator of tumor cell migration, interacting with integrins such as ITGαV and ITGβ8, which are highly expressed in glioma tumor cells (Ghochani2021Generation). In colorectal cancer, IBSP promotes progression via the Fyn/β-catenin signaling pathway, with its downregulation leading to decreased cell proliferation and migration (Chen2021IBSP). These interactions highlight IBSP's role in facilitating cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, contributing to its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis.
