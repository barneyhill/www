# ZNF267

## Overview
ZNF267 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 267, a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger family, characterized by its role as a transcriptional repressor. The protein contains a KRAB (Kruppel associated box) domain, which is essential for its function in gene regulation, allowing it to bind to specific DNA sequences and modulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 267 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation, particularly in liver tissue. It is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation through hormonal and cytokine signaling pathways. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as LARP6, further influence its stability and function, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular physiology and pathological conditions, including liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer (Schnabl2005Zinc; Zipper2023Steroid).

## Structure
ZNF267 is a zinc finger protein that belongs to the Kruppel-like zinc finger family. It contains a conserved KRAB (Kruppel associated box) domain in the N-terminal part, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor. The KRAB domain is divided into KRAB A and KRAB B domains, with the KRAB A domain being the primary contributor to transcriptional repression (Schnabl2005Zinc). The KRAB domain is separated by a linker region of 193 amino acids from a clustered zinc finger domain. The protein structure includes a series of zinc fingers, starting with one zinc finger followed by three degenerated fingers, and continuing with 13 zinc fingers at the carboxy terminus (Schnabl2005Zinc).

ZNF267 is localized in the nucleus, and its transcriptional repressor activity has been demonstrated through fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Schnabl2005Zinc). The protein has an approximate molecular weight of 90 kDa, although structural predictions suggest a molecular weight of 87 kDa (Schnabl2005Zinc). The protein's structure and function are typical of zinc finger proteins, which often bind DNA and regulate gene expression. However, specific details about its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZNF267, or zinc finger protein 267, functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in human cells. It contains a KRAB domain, which is known for its potent transcriptional repression activity. This domain allows ZNF267 to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression by inhibiting transcription (Schnabl2005Zinc). ZNF267 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by modulating the expression of target genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation (Schnabl2005Zinc).

In healthy human cells, ZNF267 is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in liver tissue. It is widely expressed across human intestinal cell types and is induced through estrogen signaling, suggesting a role in hormonal regulation of cell proliferation (Zipper2023Steroid). The protein's activity is modulated by specific cytokines, such as IL-1b and nitric oxide donors, which can enhance its transactivation, although its repressor function is independent of histone deacetylase activity (Schnabl2005Zinc).

ZNF267's role in transcriptional repression and its regulation by cytokines highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological signals in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF267, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in several liver-related diseases and cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, ZNF267 is up-regulated during the activation of human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which is a key event in these conditions. This up-regulation leads to the repression of the MMP-10 gene, involved in extracellular matrix degradation, potentially promoting liver fibrogenesis by increasing extracellular matrix accumulation (Schnabl2005Zinc).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF267 expression is also up-regulated and is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and migration. The transcription factor Ets-1, activated under hypoxic conditions and by reactive oxygen species, regulates ZNF267 expression in HCC cells. Suppression of ZNF267 using siRNA has been shown to significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of HCC cells, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Schnabl2011Zinc).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF267 interacts with LARP6, which stabilizes ZNF267 mRNA, enhancing its expression. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting CRC cell migration and invasion, indicating a potential role in suppressing metastasis (Zhou2022LARP6; Long2023LARP6).

## Interactions
ZNF267, a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger family, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of the MMP-10 gene by directly binding to its promoter region, thereby inhibiting its transcription. This interaction is facilitated by the KRAB domain of ZNF267, which recruits co-repressors like KAP-1, leading to gene silencing (Schnabl2005Zinc).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF267 interacts with LARP6, which binds to and stabilizes ZNF267 mRNA, enhancing its stability and translation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, as ZNF267 binds to the SGMS2 promoter, inhibiting its expression and affecting sphingomyelin synthesis (Long2023LARP6).

The ZNF267 promoter is regulated by transcription factors such as NF-Y, which specifically binds to it, enhancing its expression. This interaction is critical for the basal promoter activity of ZNF267, as demonstrated by mutational analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Hu2005Characterization).
