# TGIF1

## Overview
TGIF1, or TGFB induced factor homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor protein involved in various cellular processes, including development and disease. The TGIF1 protein is categorized as a homeobox protein, characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates specific DNA binding. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating the TGF-β signaling pathway, impacting cell cycle progression, cellular quiescence, and self-renewal. TGIF1 interacts with several proteins, such as Smad2 and Smad3, and recruits transcriptional corepressors to modulate gene expression. Dysregulation of TGIF1 has been linked to developmental disorders like holoprosencephaly and various cancers, where it can act as a tumor suppressor. Its involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target (Parajuli2019TGIF; Zerlanko2012Premature; Dubourg2004Molecular; Li2018Characterization).

## Structure
The TGIF1 protein, encoded by the TGFB induced factor homeobox 1 gene, is a transcriptional repressor involved in human development and disease. It consists of 401 amino acids and includes several functional domains: a homeodomain (HD) and two repressive domains (RD1 and RD2) (Li2018Characterization). The homeodomain is part of the three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) superclass, which facilitates specific DNA binding to the consensus motif 5′-TGTCA-3′ (Li2018Characterization). The HD structure has been studied using NMR, revealing that the middle of helix α3 is the specific DNA binding site, with residues R220 and R221 playing key roles (Li2018Characterization).

The C-terminal region of TGIF1, known as the SIN3A-interacting domain (SID), is crucial for binding with the SIN3A PAH2 domain. This region, particularly residues F376-E394, forms an amphipathic α-helix upon binding, with key residues F379, L382, and V383 involved in hydrophobic interactions (He2021Structural). The SID undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding, similar to other PAH2 binders (He2021Structural). The TGIF1 protein can also homodimerize, although this occurs in cells and not in solution, suggesting a role for cellular factors in this process (He2021Structural).

## Function
TGIF1 (TGFB induced factor homeobox 1) is a transcriptional corepressor that plays a significant role in regulating the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular quiescence and self-renewal. In healthy human cells, TGIF1 interacts with Smad2 and Smad3 proteins, limiting TGF-β responsive gene expression by displacing coactivators and recruiting transcriptional corepressors. This action helps prevent excessive TGF-β signaling, which can lead to premature senescence and increased DNA damage, particularly under stress conditions (Zerlanko2012Premature).

TGIF1 is also involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where it influences quiescence and self-renewal. The gene's expression affects the balance between HSC proliferation and quiescence, essential for maintaining the stem cell pool and ensuring proper hematopoiesis (Yan2013Tgif1). TGIF1's role extends to the repression of specific target genes, such as EVI5L, through direct binding, independent of TGF-β signaling pathways (Anderson2017Tgif1). This regulatory function is vital for normal cellular functions, including modulating responses to oxidative stress and maintaining proper cell cycle regulation (Zerlanko2012Premature).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the TGIF1 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and cancers. TGIF1 mutations are associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a genetic condition characterized by craniofacial malformations and brain development issues. Specific mutations, such as a nonsense mutation (p.Tyr59X) and a missense mutation (p.Gln107Leu), have been identified in individuals with HPE, leading to a range of phenotypes from mild facial anomalies to severe brain malformations (Dubourg2004Molecular).

In the context of cancer, TGIF1 acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Its inactivation, particularly in the presence of oncogenic Kras mutations, accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis. This is partly due to the de-repression of Twist1, a gene associated with metastasis, and alterations in TGF-β signaling pathways (Parajuli2019TGIF; Weng2019Loss). Loss of TGIF1 also leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment, promoting immune suppression and enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to increased cancer cell invasiveness and stemness (Weng2019Loss). These findings highlight TGIF1's critical role in maintaining normal cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
TGIF1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression and cellular signaling. It binds to the SIN3A PAH2 domain through a C-terminal amphipathic helix, forming a complex that involves hydrophobic and polar interactions. Key residues such as F379, L382, and V383 are crucial for this binding, which is essential for TGIF1's function as a transcriptional repressor (He2021Structural). TGIF1 also interacts with SMAD proteins, specifically Smad2 and Smad3, in response to TGFβ signaling. This interaction represses Smad target gene expression by displacing coactivators and recruiting transcriptional corepressors (Zerlanko2012Premature).

TGIF1's interaction with DNA involves its homeodomain, which undergoes conformational changes upon binding to consensus DNA sequences. This binding induces broader conformational changes beyond the specific DNA binding site, affecting the protein's structure and function (Li2018Characterization). Additionally, TGIF1 interacts with the mSin3A corepressor and recruits class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress gene expression. It contains a PLDLS motif that interacts with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP, highlighting its role in gene regulation (Melhuish2010Tgif1).
