# S100A4

## Overview
S100A4 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A4, a member of the S100 family of proteins characterized by their ability to bind calcium ions through EF-hand motifs. The protein, also known as metastasin, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell motility, adhesion, and migration, by interacting with cytoskeletal components such as F-actin and non-muscle myosin heavy chains. S100A4 is expressed in a variety of cell types and is involved in physiological processes like tissue fibrosis, inflammation, and immune responses. It is particularly noted for its role in cancer metastasis, where it influences tumor progression and cell migration through interactions with proteins such as ezrin and p53. The dysregulation of S100A4 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Allgöwer2020Friend; Heizmann2019S100; Orre2013S100A4).

## Structure
The S100A4 protein, also known as metastasin, is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. It features two EF-hand calcium-binding domains: a pseudo EF-hand (EF-hand I) and a canonical EF-hand (EF-hand II). The pseudo EF-hand is formed by helices H1, L2, and H2, coordinating calcium ions primarily through backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms, while the canonical EF-hand, formed by helices H3, L3, and H4, coordinates calcium ions with higher affinity through side chain oxygen atoms (Pathuri2008Crystal).

In its calcium-bound form, S100A4 undergoes significant conformational changes, particularly in helices H2 and H3, and loop regions L1, L2, and L3. Helix H3 reorients by 70°, opening the target binding region formed by helix H4 and loop L2 (Pathuri2008Crystal). The protein typically forms symmetric homodimers, facilitated by an X-type four-helix bundle between helices H1 and H4 of one monomer and H1' and H4' of the other (Pathuri2008Crystal).

S100A4's structure in the calcium-bound state reveals hydrophobic binding pockets that interact with target proteins such as annexin A2 and myosin IIA, playing a crucial role in cancer metastasis (Pathuri2008Crystal; Ramagopal2013Structure).

## Function
The S100A4 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell motility, adhesion, proliferation, and migration, primarily through its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins such as F-actin and non-muscle myosin heavy chains. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular stability and facilitating normal cellular processes (D’Ambrosi2021S100A4; Gonzalez2020Role).

S100A4 is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes, and vascular cells, and is involved in processes like tissue fibrosis, inflammation, and immune responses. It enhances the motility of immune cells, promoting their recruitment and chemotaxis to regulate inflammation (Fei2017Role). In the nervous system, S100A4 is considered a neuroprotective factor, aiding in neuron survival and promoting neurite outgrowth, particularly through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (Fei2017Role).

The protein also plays a role in angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell migration and invasion, working synergistically with other angiogenic factors (Fei2017Role). S100A4's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cell migration, survival, and vascular development in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S100A4 gene are significantly associated with cancer progression and metastasis. Overexpression of S100A4 is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers (Allgöwer2020Friend; Gross2013Joining; Heizmann2019S100). In breast cancer, S100A4 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis by interacting with matrix metalloproteinases (Allgöwer2020Friend). In colorectal cancer, S100A4 is involved in activating pathways like ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, which enhance tumor progression and cell migration (Allgöwer2020Friend).

S100A4 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its degradation and leading to reduced p53 activity, which facilitates cancer progression (Orre2013S100A4). This interaction is particularly significant in lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer, where high S100A4 expression correlates with decreased p53 levels (Orre2013S100A4).

In addition to its role in cancer, S100A4 is implicated in chronic inflammation and allergy. It induces the expression of acute-phase proteins and cytokines, linking inflammation with tumor progression (Heizmann2019S100). Targeting S100A4 with small molecule inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies is being explored as a potential cancer treatment strategy (Allgöwer2020Friend).

## Interactions
S100A4 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds to ezrin, a member of the ERM protein family, which is involved in cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. S100A4 interacts with both the N-terminal ERM domain (N-ERMAD) and the C-terminal actin-binding domain (C-ERMAD) of ezrin with micromolar affinity. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer metastasis, as both proteins are implicated in promoting metastasis (BiriKovács2017Ezrin).

S100A4 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the nucleus, promoting its degradation. This interaction is enhanced when MDM2-dependent p53 degradation is inhibited, suggesting a role for S100A4 in modulating p53 stability and activity. The interaction between S100A4 and p53 is significant in cancer progression, as it affects p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Orre2013S100A4).

In neurons, S100A4 induces calcium signaling and neurite outgrowth. This effect is mediated by a plasma membrane receptor and involves the activation of G protein signaling pathways. The oligomeric form of S100A4 is particularly effective in triggering these responses, suggesting a role in neuronal differentiation and response to injury (Kiryushko2006Molecular).
