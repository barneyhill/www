# UPP2

## Overview
Uridine phosphorylase 2 (UPP2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme uridine phosphorylase 2, which is primarily expressed in the liver. This enzyme is a key component of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, where it catalyzes the reversible conversion of uridine into uracil and ribose-1-phosphate. As a cytosolic enzyme, uridine phosphorylase 2 plays a significant role in maintaining nucleotide pool balance and cellular energy homeostasis by facilitating the recycling of pyrimidine nucleosides. The activity of UPP2 is crucial for various metabolic processes, including glucose, lipid, and amino acid homeostasis, and it has implications for cellular proliferation and energy metabolism (Skinner2023Salvage; Zhang2020Uridine). The gene's expression and mutations have been studied in the context of cancer and other diseases, although the full clinical significance of these findings is still under investigation (Nordgard2008Pathway; Edwards2016Hypermutation).

## Function
Uridine phosphorylase 2 (UPP2) is a liver-specific enzyme that plays a crucial role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which is essential for maintaining nucleotide pool balance and cellular energy homeostasis. UPP2 catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine into uracil and ribose-1-phosphate, a process that is vital for recycling pyrimidine nucleosides and supporting nucleotide metabolism (Zhang2020Uridine). This enzymatic activity is primarily cytosolic and impacts cellular proliferation and energy metabolism by providing ribose-1-phosphate, which can enter glycolysis through the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (Skinner2023Salvage).

In healthy human cells, UPP2 is involved in regulating uridine homeostasis, particularly in the liver, where it helps maintain endogenous uridine levels. This regulation is important for protecting the liver from drug-induced lipid accumulation and other types of damage (Zhang2020Uridine). UPP2's activity is also linked to increased protein acetylation through the production of β-alanine and acetyl-CoA during uridine catabolism, highlighting its role in broader metabolic processes (Zhang2020Uridine). The enzyme's function in the liver underscores its significance in systemic metabolism, influencing glucose, lipid, and amino acid homeostasis (Zhang2020Uridine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UPP2 gene have been studied in various contexts, though their clinical significance remains somewhat unclear. In the context of cancer, UPP2 is involved in pyrimidine metabolism, and its expression can be influenced by genetic factors. For instance, a study found that the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism is associated with changes in UPP2 mRNA expression levels after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment, suggesting a potential TP53-dependent regulation of UPP2 expression in response to chemotherapy (Nordgard2008Pathway). 

In autism research, a specific deletion in the UPP2 gene was identified, which removed two coding exons and was predicted to cause a frameshift leading to a premature termination codon. However, this deletion was not significantly associated with autism susceptibility, as it was not consistently transmitted to affected children in family studies (Maestrini2009Highdensity).

In melanoma, UPP2 has been noted for its high somatic mutation rate, although the specific clinical implications of these mutations are not detailed. The gene is part of a broader analysis of pyrimidine metabolism deregulation in cancer (Edwards2016Hypermutation). Despite these findings, the precise role of UPP2 mutations and expression changes in disease remains to be fully elucidated.
