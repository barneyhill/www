# ADAM10

## Overview
ADAM10 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the metzincin superfamily. This protein functions as a membrane-anchored metalloprotease, playing a pivotal role in the proteolytic processing of various cell surface proteins. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. ADAM10 is particularly significant in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby preventing the formation of amyloid-beta peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease (Prinzen2005Genomic). Additionally, ADAM10 is essential for the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, influencing cell fate decisions during brain development and affecting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Saftig2015The). The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with tetraspanins and other proteins, which regulate its substrate specificity and cellular localization (Arduise2008Tetraspanins; Endres2017Regulation). Given its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, ADAM10 is a significant focus of research in neurodegenerative and neurological disorders.

## Structure
ADAM10 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the metzincin superfamily, characterized by a conserved domain structure. It includes an N-terminal signal sequence, a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF-like repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Deng2014Membraneenabled; Escrevente2008Functional). The metalloprotease domain features a kidney bean-like fold with a catalytic cleft, which is crucial for its proteolytic activity (Seegar2019Domain). The disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains form a continuous, elongated cup shape, with the disintegrin domain stabilized by disulfide bonds (Seegar2019Domain).

The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM10 is intrinsically disordered but can adopt an ordered α-helical conformation when adjacent to the transmembrane domain, facilitating dimerization (Deng2014Membraneenabled). ADAM10 undergoes N-glycosylation at four potential sites, which is essential for its processing, activity, and resistance to proteolysis (Escrevente2008Functional). The protein is also subject to phosphorylation, which influences its function and localization (Tosetti2021ADAM10). The structure of ADAM10 includes conserved disulfide bonds and calcium ions that contribute to its stability and function (Seegar2019Domain).

## Function
ADAM10 is a membrane-anchored metalloprotease involved in the proteolytic processing of various cell surface proteins, playing a critical role in cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. In healthy human cells, ADAM10 functions as an α-secretase, participating in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This activity prevents the formation of amyloid-beta peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, by releasing a soluble APP fragment with neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties (Prinzen2005Genomic).

ADAM10 is essential for the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which influences cell fate decisions, particularly between neuronal and glial cells. This regulation is crucial during brain development, affecting processes such as neurogenesis, synaptic formation, and axonal guidance (Saftig2015The). ADAM10 also plays a role in synaptic plasticity by modulating the postsynaptic surface and influencing synaptogenesis (Saftig2015The).

The protease is active in the plasma membrane and endosomes, where it cleaves substrates like Notch receptors and other cell adhesion molecules, impacting cell-cell communication and intracellular signaling (Saftig2015The). ADAM10's activity is necessary for maintaining its surface expression, with its inhibition leading to downregulation and affecting the shedding of substrates (Seifert2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAM10 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). ADAM10 is a key α-secretase involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which prevents the formation of neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Mutations in ADAM10, such as Q170H and R181G, are associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and lead to impaired α-secretase activity, resulting in increased Aβ accumulation (Kim2009Potential; Suh2013ADAM10). These mutations affect the prodomain chaperone function of ADAM10, crucial for its proper folding and activity, thereby contributing to AD pathogenesis (Suh2013ADAM10).

Alterations in ADAM10 expression levels are also linked to AD. Reduced ADAM10 activity is associated with increased Aβ production and AD pathology, while overexpression has been shown to reduce AD pathology, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Saftig2015The). In addition to AD, ADAM10 is implicated in other neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and traumatic brain injury, where its expression changes can influence synaptic function and recovery processes (Endres2017Regulation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ADAM10 in neurodegenerative and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ADAM10 interacts with a variety of proteins, forming complexes that regulate its activity and substrate specificity. It associates with tetraspanins, such as CD9, CD81, CD82, and CD151, which regulate ADAM10-mediated cleavage of substrates like TNF-α and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Arduise2008Tetraspanins). Tetraspanins organize ADAM10 into specific membrane microdomains, enhancing its proteolytic activity (Arduise2008Tetraspanins).

ADAM10 also interacts with synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), which is crucial for its insertion into the synaptic membrane (Endres2017Regulation). The interaction with SAP97 is mediated by a protein kinase C phosphorylation site within the SAP97 SRC homology domain. ADAM10's activity is influenced by its interaction with Src family kinases and other SH3 domain-containing proteins, affecting endocytosis and membrane trafficking (Saftig2015The; Tosetti2021ADAM10).

The TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, including Tspan14 and Tspan33, is essential for ADAM10's maturation and cell surface expression. Knockdown of Tspan14 results in decreased surface expression of ADAM10, highlighting the importance of these interactions for ADAM10's function (Haining2012The). ADAM10 also forms complexes with proteins like pleckstrin homology domain-containing family A member 7 (PLEKHA7) and afadin, which are involved in forming stable α-toxin pores (Tosetti2021ADAM10).
