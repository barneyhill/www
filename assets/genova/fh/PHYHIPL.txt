# PHYHIPL

## Overview
The PHYHIPL gene encodes the protein phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase interacting protein like, which is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the breakdown of phytanic acid, a type of fatty acid. This protein is characterized by the presence of a fibronectin type III domain, suggesting its potential role in mediating protein-protein interactions. Although the precise molecular function of PHYHIPL remains largely unknown, it is believed to contribute to cellular lipid processing and energy homeostasis, with high expression levels observed in the brain and testis, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons. The gene has been implicated in cerebellum-related diseases, with specific genetic variations potentially affecting motor coordination and being linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (Sugimoto2021The; Fu2019PhytanoylCoA).

## Structure
The PHYHIPL gene encodes a protein that shares 75% amino acid sequence identity with its paralog, PHYHIP (PHY1), and is referred to as PHY2 in some contexts (Sugimoto2021The). The PHY2 protein contains a fibronectin type III domain, identified using the Prosite domain database, which is part of the fibronectin type III superfamily. This domain is characterized by an Ig-like β-sandwich fold and is involved in homophilic binding, which is critical for fibronectin matrix assembly (Sugimoto2021The). The presence of this domain suggests that PHY2 may interact with other proteins, potentially having distinct functions from PHY1, although the exact function of PHY2 remains unclear (Sugimoto2021The).

The PHY2 protein is highly expressed in the brain and testis, with specific expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells, and neocortical cells located in the deep layers (Sugimoto2021The). Despite these insights, detailed information on the complete molecular structure, including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context. Therefore, the full structural characterization of the PHYHIPL protein remains to be elucidated.

## Function
The PHYHIPL gene encodes a protein that is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the breakdown of phytanic acid, a type of fatty acid. This protein is thought to interact with enzymes such as phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, which is crucial for the catabolism of phytanic acid, suggesting a role in cellular lipid processing and energy homeostasis (Fu2019PhytanoylCoA). The PHYHIPL protein is expressed in the brain and testis, with high mRNA levels observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells, and neocortical cells (Sugimoto2021The). 

In healthy human cells, PHYHIPL is believed to be active in cellular compartments involved in lipid metabolism, such as the peroxisomes, where it may contribute to the regulation of lipid metabolic pathways. The protein shares structural features with the Fibronectin type-III domain, which may mediate specific protein-protein interactions, indicating its potential involvement in complex cellular processes (Sugimoto2021The). The exact molecular function of PHYHIPL remains largely unknown, but its role in lipid metabolism and potential interactions with other proteins suggest it may be significant in maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic health (Sugimoto2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The PHYHIPL gene, also known as PHY2, has been implicated in cerebellum-related diseases due to the presence of the Ser19Stop single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). This SNP is associated with altered gene expression in conditions such as global ischemia and glioblastoma multiforme, although its exact function remains unknown (Sugimoto2021The). Studies using PHYHIPL Ser19Stop knock-in mice have shown that this mutation leads to significant changes in cerebellar Purkinje cells, including reduced cell density, smaller soma size, and altered morphology. These changes are linked to impaired motor coordination, as evidenced by poorer performance in motor tests, suggesting a potential connection to conditions like autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by similar cerebellar abnormalities (Sugimoto2021The).

The Ser19Stop SNP is notably more frequent in the Japanese population compared to the American population, primarily in heterozygous form, indicating potential population-specific genetic risks (Sugimoto2021The). Despite these findings, the association between PHY2 SNPs and human diseases is not fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research to understand its clinical significance (Sugimoto2021The).

## Interactions
The PHYHIPL protein, encoded by the PHYHIPL gene, is suggested to have potential interactions with other proteins through its structural features. It shares 75% amino acid sequence identity with PHY1, which is known to interact with several proteins, including the Refsum disease gene product phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase (PAHX), brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), and dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). However, specific interactions of PHYHIPL with these proteins have not been confirmed, as studies have found no binding activity between PHYHIPL and PAHX, BAI1, or DYRK1A (Sugimoto2021The).

The PHYHIPL protein contains a fibronectin type III domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that PHYHIPL may engage in such interactions, although the specific proteins involved remain unidentified (Sugimoto2021The). Despite the lack of direct evidence of PHYHIPL's interactions, its potential role in protein networks and cellular processes is indicated by its structural similarities to other interacting proteins. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interaction partners and functional implications of PHYHIPL in cellular contexts.
