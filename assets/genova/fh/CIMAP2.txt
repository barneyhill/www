# CIMAP2

## Overview
CIMAP2 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule associated protein 2, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMAP2 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cilia. These microtubules are critical for the proper functioning of cilia, influencing processes such as cell signaling and motility. Disruptions in the function of ciliary microtubule associated protein 2 can lead to a variety of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by dysfunctional cilia (Qiu2020aarFDC).
