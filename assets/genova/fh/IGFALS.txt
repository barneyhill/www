# IGFALS

## Overview
The IGFALS gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor binding protein acid labile subunit (ALS), a glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. ALS is primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, where it forms a ternary complex with IGF-I or IGF-II and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) -3 or -5. This complex significantly extends the half-life of IGFs, thereby regulating their bioavailability and activity in the circulation. The ALS protein is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is crucial for its structural stability and interaction with IGFBPs. Mutations in the IGFALS gene can lead to acid-labile subunit deficiency, a condition associated with growth deficiencies and altered IGF levels. The study of IGFALS and its encoded protein is essential for understanding growth regulation and related disorders (Boisclair2001The; Domené2009Human; David2012A).

## Structure
The IGFALS gene encodes the acid-labile subunit (ALS) protein, which plays a crucial role in the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2) by forming a ternary complex with IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) -3 or -5. The ALS protein is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, consisting of 21 beta-alpha structural units, which contributes to its structural stability and protein-protein interactions (David2012A). The protein's structure is modeled in a horseshoe shape with a negatively charged concave surface, differing from the previously proposed doughnut shape (David2012A).

The N-and C-terminal regions of ALS are enriched in proline residues and contain potential disulfide bonds, which likely cap the LRR hydrophobic core and maintain structural integrity (David2012A). The model predicts the presence of six disulfide bridges and several glycosylation sites, which are solvent accessible and contribute to the protein's molecular weight (David2012A). Glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification, with multiple N-glycosylation sites identified (David2012A). The electrostatic surface of ALS is largely negatively charged, facilitating interactions with IGFBP3 and -5 (David2012A).

## Function
The IGFALS gene encodes the acid-labile subunit (ALS), a glycoprotein primarily produced in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. ALS is a critical component of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, where it forms a ternary complex with IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and to a lesser extent IGFBP-5. This complex significantly extends the half-life of IGF-I from approximately 10 minutes in its free form to over 12 hours when bound, thereby maintaining a stable reservoir of bioactive IGFs in the serum (Boisclair2001The; Domené2011Acidlabile).

In healthy human cells, ALS plays a vital role in regulating the bioavailability and activity of IGFs by preventing their non-specific metabolic effects, such as severe hypoglycemia, by ensuring that IGFs in ternary complexes cannot traverse capillary endothelia to activate insulin receptors (Boisclair2001The). The presence of ALS is essential for maintaining normal circulating levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3, which are crucial for growth and development (Domené2007Phenotypic). ALS also helps regulate the metabolic and mitogenic effects of IGFs, particularly IGF-II, which is important for fetal growth but must be restrained postnatally (Ueki2000Inactivation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IGFALS gene, which encodes the acid-labile subunit (ALS) of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, are associated with a condition known as acid-labile subunit deficiency (ALS deficiency). This condition is characterized by moderate short stature, delayed puberty, and low serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 due to the failure to form ternary complexes, which are crucial for the stability and function of insulin-like growth factors (Domené2009Human; Işık2017Clinical). Patients with ALS deficiency often exhibit growth hormone insensitivity and may experience insulin resistance, as indicated by elevated insulin levels despite normal glucose levels (Domené2007Phenotypic; Domené2009Human).

The inheritance pattern of ALS deficiency is typically autosomal recessive, with mutations leading to complete absence or severe reduction of ALS in the serum. These mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and duplication mutations, often affecting the leucine-rich repeat region of the protein, resulting in defects in protein secretion or stability (Domené2009Human). Heterozygous carriers of IGFALS mutations may also exhibit a mild growth phenotype, with a height loss of approximately 1.0 standard deviation compared to non-carriers (Savage2011Genetic).

## Interactions
The IGFALS gene encodes the acid-labile subunit (ALS), which is a crucial component of a ternary complex involving insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins, primarily IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5. This complex is essential for stabilizing IGF-I in the circulation, thereby extending its half-life and modulating its bioavailability and activity (Martucci2016Assessment; Işık2017Clinical). ALS does not bind free IGF-I directly but interacts with the binary complexes of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 or IGF-I/IGFBP-5, forming a 150-kDa ternary complex that prevents rapid clearance of IGFs from the bloodstream (Işık2017Clinical).

Mutations in the IGFALS gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired formation of the ternary complex and increased clearance of IGF-I and IGFBP-3, which is associated with growth deficiencies such as short stature (Martucci2016Assessment; Işık2017Clinical). The leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in ALS are important for its interaction with IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, and mutations affecting these motifs can significantly impair the protein's function (Işık2017Clinical). The interaction of ALS with IGFBP-3 is enhanced by IGF binding, likely due to a conformational change in the IGFBP (Baxter2000Insulinlike).
