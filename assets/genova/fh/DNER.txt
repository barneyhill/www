# DNER

## Overview
The DNER gene encodes the delta/notch-like EGF-related receptor, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cell-cell interactions, particularly within the Notch signaling pathway. This protein is integral to the regulation of blood glucose homeostasis, primarily through its function in pancreatic beta-cells, where it coordinates insulin release in response to glucose levels. DNER is also involved in maintaining the structural integrity of islets and the expression of cell adhesion molecules, which are crucial for effective insulin secretion. Beyond its metabolic functions, DNER is implicated in neurological and oncological conditions, such as autoimmune cerebellar ataxia and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, through its interactions with signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and differentiation (D’Souza2008The; RuizOtero2023Role; Jarius2015‘Medusa).

## Function
The delta/notch-like EGF-related receptor (DNER) is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cell-cell interactions and is involved in the regulation of blood glucose homeostasis. In pancreatic beta-cells, DNER is crucial for the coordination of insulin release in response to glucose. It is expressed in these cells starting from early postnatal life and continues into adulthood, where it helps maintain the architecture of islets and the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as N-CAM and E-cadherin. These molecules are essential for proper cell-cell interactions and the regulated secretion of insulin granules (RuizOtero2023Role).

DNER also influences the expression of proteins critical for cell-cell interactions, such as connexin 36, which is a major component of gap junctions in beta-cells. This regulation is important for calcium signaling and the coordination of insulin release. The loss of DNER leads to glucose intolerance, decreased insulin secretion, and insulin resistance, highlighting its role in maintaining blood glucose levels (RuizOtero2023Role). Additionally, DNER may affect insulin sensitivity through its expression in Pdx1-positive cells outside the pancreas, including the hypothalamus, which is involved in systemic glucose metabolism (RuizOtero2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
The DNER gene is clinically significant in several neurological and oncological conditions. In autoimmune cerebellar ataxia, anti-Tr antibodies target the DNER protein, leading to Purkinje cell loss and cerebellar dysfunction. This condition is often associated with Hodgkin's disease, where anti-Tr antibodies are prevalent, suggesting a paraneoplastic origin. The presence of these antibodies can predict the recurrence of Hodgkin's disease and may disappear following successful treatment (Jarius2015‘Medusa).

In the context of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs), DNER is implicated in tumorigenesis through its involvement in the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways. DNER expression is significantly upregulated in PanNEN tumor tissues, correlating with increased expression of genes like RBPJ, SKP1, CTNNB1, and CDH2. This upregulation promotes tumor proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis, indicating a role for DNER in cancer progression (He2020Transcriptional).

While no direct association of DNER mutations with specific diseases has been reported, alterations in its expression or function are linked to cerebellar ataxia and PanNENs, highlighting its importance in both neurological and oncological pathologies (Jarius2015‘Medusa).

## Interactions
DNER (delta/notch-like EGF-related receptor) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the Notch signaling pathway. Although DNER lacks a DSL domain, it can bind to Notch when presented in trans and activate a CSL reporter in co-cultured cells. This interaction is crucial for its role as a trans-ligand, influencing glial morphological changes through Notch activation (D’Souza2008The). DNER's effects on Bergmann glia morphology are mediated in a γ-secretase-dependent but CSL-independent manner, suggesting a role for Notch proteolysis. Instead of CSL, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex is implicated as an alternative downstream effector. Deltex can bind directly to the Notch intracellular domain and form a trimeric complex with full-length Notch and β-arrestin, indicating that Notch could activate signaling through β-arrestin requiring Deltex but not CSL (D’Souza2008The).

In pancreatic beta-cells, DNER regulates the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as N-CAM and E-cadherin, which are essential for maintaining cell-cell interactions and actin remodeling. DNER depletion leads to decreased expression of these proteins, affecting glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion (RuizOtero2023Role). However, specific physical interactions of DNER with these proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts.
