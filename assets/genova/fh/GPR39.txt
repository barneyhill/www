# GPR39

## Overview
GPR39 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 39, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily activated by zinc ions and is involved in multiple signaling pathways that influence cellular functions such as synaptic plasticity, neuronal growth, and vascular health. GPR39 plays a critical role in maintaining neuroexcitatory balance in the central nervous system and is implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation in vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, it is essential for gastrointestinal health by supporting the proliferation and differentiation of colonocytes. The receptor's interactions with zinc and other GPCRs, such as the 5-HT1A receptor, underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like depression and metabolic disorders (Mlyniec2021GPCR; Zhu2018Zinc; Xu2021Role).

## Function
GPR39 is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily activated by zinc ions, which trigger several intracellular signaling pathways. In neuronal cells, GPR39 activation involves the Gαq and Gαs pathways, leading to intracellular calcium release, ERK phosphorylation, and increased cAMP levels. These pathways are associated with synaptic plasticity, neuronal growth, and protection against neuronal cell death (Xu2021Role).

In the central nervous system, GPR39 helps maintain neuroexcitatory balance by modulating synaptic zinc levels and neurotransmission. Zinc-dependent activation of GPR39 in hippocampal circuits increases intracellular calcium in postsynaptic cells, upregulating the KCC2 cotransporter and enhancing inhibitory tone to prevent excitotoxicity (Xu2021Role).

GPR39 also plays a crucial role in vascular endothelial cells, where it regulates cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis through pathways like Akt and MAPK. It influences cell adhesion, mobility, and cytoskeletal reorganization, contributing to vascular health and function (Zhu2018Zinc).

In the gastrointestinal tract, GPR39 is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of colonocytes, essential for forming the epithelial barrier. It regulates the expression of tight junction proteins, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity (Cohen2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR39 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPR39 have been linked to coronary artery disease, hypertension, acute myeloid leukemia, and altered lung capacity in smokers (Xu2021Role). GPR39 is also implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, where zinc deficiency correlates with increased disorder prevalence. GPR39 knockout mice exhibit increased anxiety behaviors, and its expression is decreased in the hippocampus and cortex of postmortem suicide victims (Xu2021Role).

In Alzheimer's disease, GPR39 is indirectly implicated through zinc perturbation affecting its function. It is highly expressed in the hippocampus and involved in zinc neurotransmission, making it a candidate in AD pathogenesis (Xu2021Role). GPR39 is also associated with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, where its expression in microglia is increased in diseased brains (Xu2021Role).

In metabolic disorders, GPR39 is involved in glucose metabolism and pancreatic islet function. GPR39-deficient mice show impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin response, indicating islet dysfunction (Holst2009G). Additionally, GPR39 is linked to obesity, with deficient mice showing increased weight and fat mass on a high-fat diet (Laitakari2021The).

## Interactions
GPR39, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is known to interact with zinc, which acts as a natural ligand. This interaction is crucial for its function, particularly in the context of depression, where zinc homeostasis plays a significant role. GPR39 forms oligomeric complexes with other GPCRs, such as the 5-HT1A receptor, resulting in the formation of dimers. These dimers can influence intracellular signaling pathways, with the 5-HT1A-GPR39 dimer showing an additive effect on signaling, while the 5-HT1A-GalR1 dimer exhibits reciprocal inhibition (Mlyniec2021GPCR). The presence of zinc can modulate these interactions by preventing the formation of 5-HT1A-GalR1 receptor dimers and promoting the formation of 5-HT1A-GPR39 dimers (Mlyniec2021GPCR).

GPR39 also interacts with the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems, as evidenced by the effects of the GPR39 agonist TC-G 1008, which influences neurotransmission through these pathways. The antidepressant-like effects of TC-G 1008 are dependent on GABAA receptor activity and are sensitive to NMDA receptor activation, although not directly associated with NMDA receptor function (Starowicz2023The). These interactions highlight the complex role of GPR39 in modulating neurotransmitter systems and its potential as a target for novel antidepressant therapies.
