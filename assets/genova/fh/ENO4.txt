# ENO4

## Overview
ENO4 is a gene that encodes the enolase 4 protein, which is a member of the enolase superfamily but is distinct from the traditional enolase enzymes involved in glycolysis. Unlike ENO1, ENO2, and ENO3, enolase 4 lacks the active site residues necessary for catalytic activity, suggesting a specialized function beyond glycolysis (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and is associated with the fibrous sheath of sperm flagella, indicating a potential role in reproductive biology and sperm development (Nakamura2013Disruption). Enolase 4 interacts with proteins such as AKAP4, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the sperm flagellum (Nakamura2013Disruption). The gene is located on chromosome 10 and is transcribed on the positive strand, with two transcript variants identified that exhibit different expression patterns during spermatogenesis (Nakamura2013Disruption; Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

## Structure
The ENO4 gene encodes a protein with a unique structure compared to other enolases. The predicted secondary structure of ENO4 includes three N-terminal α-helices, a poly-proline segment, and two β-sheets, along with an extended C-terminal sequence containing an α-helix (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The tertiary structure, modeled on E. coli enolase, features an extended chain region corresponding to the poly-proline segment and additional β-sheet segments (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). Unlike ENO1-3, ENO4 lacks active site residues, indicating it does not catalyze the glycolytic reaction (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

ENO4's structure is distinct due to its lack of the typical α/β barrel structure that forms the active site in other enolases (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The protein is expressed predominantly in the testis and is associated with the fibrous sheath of sperm flagella, interacting with proteins like AKAP4 (Nakamura2013Disruption). Two transcript variants, Eno4_v1 and Eno4_v2, have been identified, with different expression patterns during spermatogenesis (Nakamura2013Disruption). The ENO4 gene is located on chromosome 10 and is transcribed on the positive strand (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

## Function
The ENO4 gene encodes an enolase-like protein that is distinct from the traditional enolase enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as ENO1, ENO2, and ENO3. Unlike these enzymes, ENO4 lacks the active site residues necessary for typical enolase catalytic activity, suggesting it may have a different function in cellular processes (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The predicted structure of ENO4 includes unique features such as additional β-sheets and a poly-proline segment, which may indicate a specialized role beyond glycolysis (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

In humans, ENO4 is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a role in reproductive biology (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The presence of a transcription factor binding site (AHR1) in its promoter region implies a potential involvement in aryl hydrocarbon ligand binding or metabolism (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). Although the specific functions of ENO4 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its structural characteristics and expression patterns suggest it may play a role in processes related to sperm development and function, possibly contributing to the structural integrity and energy metabolism of sperm cells (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

## Interactions
ENO4, a protein associated with sperm structure and function, participates in several physical interactions crucial for the integrity of the sperm flagellum. It is localized to the principal piece region of the sperm flagellum and is involved in the fibrous sheath structure. ENO4 interacts with AKAP4, a protein also located in the fibrous sheath, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays using antiserum to AKAP4 and testis homogenates. These assays showed that AKAP4 can bind to the protein encoded by the Eno4_v1 and N-terminal regions of ENO4 (Nakamura2013Disruption).

The study also suggests that ENO4 may form heterodimers with proteins encoded by Eno1 or GM5506, as direct interaction was observed in coimmunoprecipitation assays using sperm extracts and a pan-enolase antibody. Additionally, the phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) enzyme, which is upstream of enolase in the glycolytic pathway, was shown to interact with the protein encoded by Gm5506 in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. These interactions indicate that ENO4 is part of a network of protein interactions essential for the structural integrity and function of sperm, particularly in the fibrous sheath (Nakamura2013Disruption).
