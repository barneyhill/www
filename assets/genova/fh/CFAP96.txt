# CFAP96

## Overview
The CFAP96 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 96, which is a crucial component involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. These hair-like structures are essential for cell motility and signaling, playing a significant role in various physiological processes, including embryonic development and sensory perception. The CFAP96 protein is categorized as a structural protein, contributing to the assembly and stability of axonemal microtubules within cilia and flagella. Mutations or dysregulation of CFAP96 can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by defects in cilia function, which can manifest in a range of clinical symptoms depending on the tissues affected (Qiu2020aarFDC).
