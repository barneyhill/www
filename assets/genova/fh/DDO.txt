# DDO

## Overview
The DDO gene encodes the enzyme D-aspartate oxidase, a flavoenzyme that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of D-aspartate, a D-amino acid involved in neurotransmission and hormone synthesis. D-aspartate oxidase is responsible for the oxidative deamination of D-aspartate, converting it into α-oxaloacetate, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia, thus regulating D-aspartate levels in the brain and endocrine system (Usiello2020New; Punzo2016AgeRelated). This enzyme is primarily localized in peroxisomes, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis by containing the hydrogen peroxide produced during the reaction (Usiello2020New). The DDO gene is subject to epigenetic regulation, ensuring proper enzyme activity and preventing neurotoxic effects associated with elevated D-aspartate concentrations (Punzo2016AgeRelated). Alterations in the DDO gene have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Errico2015A; Lombardo2022Daspartate).

## Structure
The human D-aspartate oxidase (DDO) is a flavoenzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of D-aspartate. The primary structure of human DDO consists of 341 amino acids, encoded by the DDO gene, with a high degree of sequence identity to its rat and mouse counterparts (Katane2015Characterization). The enzyme contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Molla2019Structure). 

The secondary structure of DDO includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a canonical dinucleotide binding fold typical of flavoenzymes (Molla2019Structure). The tertiary structure of human DDO is characterized by two main domains: the FAD-binding domain and the substrate-binding domain. The FAD-binding domain includes residues 1-46, 143-192, and 282-335, while the substrate-binding domain comprises residues 47-142 and 193-281 (Molla2019Structure).

Human DDO is monomeric in solution, although it can form tetramers under certain conditions (Takahashi2020dAspartate). The enzyme's active site is a deep cavity with positively charged arginine residues that interact with the substrate D-Asp, contributing to its specificity (Pollegioni2021Human). The DDO gene also produces splice variant isoforms, including DDO-1, the canonical form, and DDO-2, a truncated version (Pollegioni2021Human).

## Function
The DDO gene encodes the enzyme D-aspartate oxidase (DDO), which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of D-aspartate, a D-amino acid involved in neurotransmission and hormone synthesis. DDO is responsible for the oxidative deamination of D-aspartate, converting it into α-oxaloacetate, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. This reaction is essential for regulating D-aspartate levels in the brain and endocrine system, preventing neurotoxic effects associated with elevated D-aspartate concentrations (Usiello2020New; Punzo2016AgeRelated).

In healthy human cells, DDO is primarily localized in peroxisomes, where it safely contains the hydrogen peroxide produced during the oxidative deamination process. This localization is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress (Usiello2020New). DDO activity is particularly important in the central nervous system, where it helps regulate neurotransmitter levels, influencing synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology (Errico2014Free).

The enzyme's expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as promoter demethylation, which increases DDO transcription and activity postnatally. This regulation ensures that D-aspartate levels are kept in check, preventing premature neuronal death and maintaining proper brain function during aging (Punzo2016AgeRelated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the D-aspartate oxidase (DDO) gene have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, increased DDO expression in the prefrontal cortex is associated with reduced levels of D-aspartate, suggesting a molecular imbalance contributing to the disorder (Errico2015A). DDO gene alterations, such as increased expression or activity, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, potentially affecting glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (Errico2018The; Cheng2021dAmino).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities, DDO gene duplication has been associated with social recognition memory deficits in mice and cognitive impairments in humans. This genetic alteration can lead to reduced neurogenesis and gray matter volume, impacting neurodevelopmental processes (Lombardo2022Daspartate). A case study involving a patient with DDO gene duplication revealed symptoms such as psychomotor developmental delay, motor coordination difficulties, and language impairment, further supporting the link between DDO alterations and neurodevelopmental disorders (Lombardo2022Daspartate).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of DDO in various conditions, suggesting that dysregulation of D-aspartate metabolism may contribute to the development of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
