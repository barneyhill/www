# RPRD1A

## Overview
RPRD1A, or regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 1A, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) activity. The RPRD1A protein is characterized by its CTD interaction domain (CID), which allows it to interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II, playing a pivotal role in transcription regulation, RNA processing, and chromatin modification. As a regulatory protein, RPRD1A is involved in the dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the CTD, particularly influencing the phosphorylation states of serine residues, which are crucial for transcriptional control. Additionally, RPRD1A interacts with various proteins, such as RPAP2 and TRIM21, and is implicated in pathways like Wnt/β-catenin signaling, affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. Its expression levels have clinical significance, being associated with cancer progression and other diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Ni2011Control; Feng2021RPRD1A; Ni2014RPRD1A).

## Structure
The RPRD1A protein features a CTD interaction domain (CID) composed of 8 α-helices arranged in a right-handed superhelical manner. This structure accommodates a CTD decapeptide in a linear conformation, with specific residues such as N18, N64, D65, Q20, R114, and N69 forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the CTD. Electrostatic forces also play a role, with phosphate groups of the CTD aligning towards positively charged areas on the CID surface (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1A contains coiled-coil domains that facilitate dimerization, allowing it to form homo- or heterodimers with RPRD1B. These dimers present a two-CID scaffold for interaction with RNA polymerase II CTD repeats, enhancing CTD binding through synergistic interactions (Ni2014RPRD1A). The coiled-coil domain of RPRD1A is predicted to fold similarly to that of RPRD1B, which forms a homodimer with a head-to-tail association of two intertwined alpha helices (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1A is involved in the dephosphorylation of the CTD, particularly at serine position 5 (S5P), and interacts with RPAP2 to facilitate this process. The protein's interaction with phosphorylated CTD isoforms is crucial for its function in transcription regulation (Ni2014RPRD1A).

## Function
RPRD1A, also known as regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 1A, plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) activity, particularly through its interaction with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II. This protein is involved in the dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the CTD, which is essential for transcription regulation, RNA processing, and chromatin modification (Ni2011Control; Ni2014RPRD1A). RPRD1A, along with RPRD1B, forms dimers that preferentially bind to CTD repeats phosphorylated at serine 2 (S2P) and serine 7 (S7P), acting as scaffolds to facilitate the dephosphorylation of serine 5 (S5P) by RPAP2 (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1A is also involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with HDAC2 to repress gene transcription by decreasing the acetylation of histone H3, thereby preventing β-catenin from associating with TCF4. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the repression of Wnt target genes in the absence of Wnt signaling, impacting cell proliferation and differentiation (Liu2015p15RSRPRD1A). RPRD1A's role in these molecular processes highlights its importance in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPRD1A gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPRD1A is frequently up-regulated and associated with aggressive clinical features, including larger tumor size, vein invasion, and advanced stages of the disease. This overexpression stabilizes the NRF2 protein by competing with p62 for TRIM21 binding, leading to decreased NRF2 degradation and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis. The RPRD1A-TRIM21-p62 axis is also linked to chemotherapeutic resistance, as RPRD1A overexpression reduces sensitivity to oxidative stress and platinum-based drugs, contributing to poor prognosis in HCC patients (Feng2021RPRD1A).

In contrast, RPRD1A expression is significantly reduced in breast cancer, particularly in cases with distant metastasis. Lower levels of RPRD1A are correlated with shorter overall survival and poorer relapse-free survival, suggesting its downregulation plays a role in breast cancer metastasis. RPRD1A acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and its suppression by miR-454-3p leads to increased cancer progression (Ren2019MiR4543pMediated).

Additionally, the expression of hsa_circRPRD1A, a circular RNA derived from RPRD1A, is decreased in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, suggesting a potential protective role against CAD (He2023Interaction).

## Interactions
RPRD1A interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) by binding to its phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD), particularly recognizing the S2P and S7P phosphoisoforms. This interaction is facilitated by the CTD interaction domains (CIDs) present in RPRD1A, which form a concave channel accommodating the CTD peptide through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces (Ni2014RPRD1A). RPRD1A forms heterodimers with RPRD1B, which are crucial for mediating the association of RPAP2 with RNAP II. This interaction is essential for RPAP2's recruitment to RNAP II, as RPRD1A knockdown significantly reduces RPAP2's co-precipitation with RNAP II (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1A also interacts with TRIM21, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. It competes with p62 for TRIM21 binding, which stabilizes NRF2 by preventing its ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction enhances the antioxidant capacity of HCC cells and affects NRF2 protein stability (Feng2021RPRD1A). Additionally, RPRD1A enhances the interaction between HDAC2 and TCF4, inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by promoting the formation of the HDAC2-TCF4 complex (Liu2015p15RSRPRD1A).
