# PIK3R2

## Overview
The PIK3R2 gene encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 2, commonly referred to as p85β, which is a critical component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, forming a heterodimer with the p110 catalytic subunit to modulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is pivotal for various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival (Fruman2010Regulatory). The p85β subunit is characterized by its Src Homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains, which facilitate interactions with phosphorylated tyrosines on receptor tyrosine kinases and other adaptor proteins, thereby influencing signal transduction pathways (Cortés2012p85β). While p85β is expressed at lower levels than its counterpart p85α, it plays a unique role in specific cellular contexts, including acting as a negative regulator in endothelial cells (Kok2009Regulation). Mutations in PIK3R2 have been linked to developmental brain disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Mirzaa2015Characterisation; Shi2020PIK3R2Pik3r2).

## Structure
The PIK3R2 gene encodes the p85β regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The primary structure of p85β includes Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains and an SH3 domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Cortés2012p85β). The secondary structure of p85β features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing p85β to interact effectively with other proteins. In terms of quaternary structure, p85β forms a complex with the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, which is essential for its regulatory role (Ito2014Oncogenic).

Post-translational modifications of p85β include phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the PI3K pathway (Barber2006PTEN). The p85β subunit has a higher affinity for the physiological substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2 compared to p85α, which contributes to its role in tumor progression by augmenting plasma membrane PIP3 levels and activating the PI3K effector PKB (Cortés2012p85β). The structural features of p85β, including its domain composition and post-translational modifications, are integral to its function in cellular signaling and cancer progression.

## Function
The PIK3R2 gene encodes the p85β regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, p85β is involved in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Fruman2010Regulatory). The p85β subunit forms a heterodimer with the catalytic subunit p110, stabilizing it and controlling its activity. This interaction is vital for the recruitment of PI3K to specific cellular signaling proteins, facilitated by the SH2 domains of p85β, which bind to phosphorylated tyrosines (Fruman2010Regulatory).

p85β is expressed at lower levels than p85α in most tissues, and its expression is regulated by noncoding RNA, such as miRNA-126, which can downregulate its mRNA expression (Kok2009Regulation). In endothelial cells, p85β acts as a negative regulator of PI3K, influencing blood vessel integrity (Kok2009Regulation). Although p85β is not essential for normal development, as mice lacking this subunit develop normally, it has been shown to have a compensatory role in certain cellular contexts, such as B cell function (Oak2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIK3R2 gene are associated with several developmental brain disorders, including megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome and bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP). These conditions are characterized by brain overgrowth and cortical malformations, often leading to neurological symptoms such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, and oromotor dysfunction (Mirzaa2015Characterisation; Terrone2016De; Shi2020PIK3R2Pik3r2). 

The most common mutation in PIK3R2, p.Gly373Arg, is a gain-of-function mutation that leads to hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, resulting in increased cell size and brain overgrowth (Mirzaa2015Characterisation; Shi2020PIK3R2Pik3r2). This mutation has been identified in both constitutional and mosaic forms, with varying clinical presentations depending on the level of mosaicism (Dobyns2019Megalencephaly).

In addition to MPPH and BPP, PIK3R2 mutations have been implicated in familial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), where a specific mutation, p.Arg89Cys, was identified as a potential pathogenic variant. This mutation disrupts the protein structure, potentially altering its function and contributing to epilepsy (Wang2021A).

## Interactions
PIK3R2 encodes the p85β regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in various cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the p110 catalytic subunit to form the PI3K complex, a critical component in signal transduction related to cell growth, survival, and metabolism (VallejoDíaz2019The). PIK3R2 also interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins like IRS1, playing a role in insulin signaling and other pathways (VallejoDíaz2019The).

PIK3R2 is targeted by microRNA-126 (miR-126), which binds to its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), leading to decreased expression of PIK3R2 and subsequent modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in various contexts, including endothelial progenitor cell function and cancer (Meng2015Upregulation; SONG2015MicroRNA126). In prostate cancer, miR-126 inhibits proliferation and metastasis by targeting PIK3R2, affecting the PI3K/p-AKT pathway (SONG2015MicroRNA126).

PIK3R2 is also involved in the formation of a macro-complex that regulates PTEN activation, although it does not bind directly to PTEN, unlike its counterpart p85α (VallejoDíaz2019The). These interactions highlight the role of PIK3R2 in cellular signaling and its potential implications in cancer and other diseases.
