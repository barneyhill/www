# FANK1

## Overview
FANK1 (fibronectin type III and ankyrin repeat domains 1) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III and ankyrin repeat domains, which are essential for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis, particularly during spermatogenesis, thereby influencing male fertility (Barbirou2022Evaluation). The FANK1 protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure modulation, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to maintain protein stability and regulate gene expression. Its interactions with components like RYBP and COPS5 underscore its significance in apoptosis regulation and transcriptional control (Huang2019COP9; Bajusz2019Evolving). The gene's expression and function are implicated in several clinical conditions, including cancer and genetic syndromes, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Shrestha2024Pharmacogenomics; Barbirou2022Evaluation).

## Structure


## Function
FANK1 (fibronectin type III and ankyrin repeat domains 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The protein contains fibronectin type III and ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for its function in the cell. FANK1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, influencing male fertility (Barbirou2022Evaluation).

In terms of molecular processes, FANK1 has been identified as a novel binding partner in mammalian cells, where it prevents the proteasome degradation of polyubiquitinated FANK1. This suggests a protective role in maintaining protein stability, which may be critical in cancer development (Barbirou2022Evaluation). The gene's expression is co-regulated with neighboring genes, such as ADAM12, indicating a potential role in transcriptional regulation through chromatin-associated mechanisms (Mondal2010Characterization).

The gene's involvement in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation is further supported by its association with intergenic chromatin-associated RNAs (CARs), which help establish active chromatin structures, thereby positively regulating transcription of neighboring genes (Mondal2010Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FANK1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In breast cancer, FANK1 has been identified as a potential early detection biomarker. Variants in FANK1, along with other genes, were found in subjects with dense breast tissue, suggesting a somatic association with breast cancer risk (Barbirou2022Evaluation). In Kawasaki disease, FANK1 is noted for its potential role in the response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Mutations in FANK1 may dysregulate the activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathway, impairing cell apoptosis and increasing susceptibility to inflammatory processes (Shrestha2024Pharmacogenomics).

FANK1 is also associated with Angelman syndrome, where it is one of the hyper-methylated genes near promoter regions. Although hyper-methylation typically leads to downregulation, the specific role of FANK1 in Angelman syndrome remains unclear (Panov2022An). Additionally, FANK1 is involved in male fertility, particularly in germ cell survival and apoptosis regulation. Its interaction with COPS5 is crucial for normal spermatogenesis, and alterations in this interaction can lead to increased apoptosis and reduced sperm count (Huang2019COP9). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of FANK1 across different conditions.

## Interactions
FANK1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with RYBP (Ring1 and YY1 Binding Protein) through its FNIII domain, while RYBP uses its C-terminal serine/threonine-rich domain for this interaction. This binding stabilizes FANK1 by preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation, which is crucial for regulating apoptosis during meiosis (Bajusz2019Evolving).

FANK1 is also a binding partner of COPS5, a component of the COP9 signalosome complex. This interaction is important for controlling germ cell apoptosis by regulating apoptosis-related gene expression. The absence of COPS5 leads to reduced FANK1 expression and increased apoptosis in germ cells, suggesting that COPS5 may regulate FANK1 through ubiquitination processes (Huang2019COP9).

Additionally, FANK1 is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with chromatin-associated RNA, specifically Intergenic10. This non-coding RNA positively regulates FANK1 expression by establishing active chromatin structures, indicating a cis-regulatory effect on transcription (Mondal2010Characterization). These interactions highlight FANK1's role in apoptosis regulation and transcriptional control.
