# TUBB

## Overview
The TUBB gene encodes the tubulin beta class I protein, a critical component of the microtubule cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. As a member of the tubulin family, this protein plays a pivotal role in the polymerization and dynamic regulation of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape (Sferra2020TUBB). The tubulin beta class I protein forms heterodimers with alpha-tubulin, which subsequently assemble into microtubules, facilitating their structural and functional roles within the cell (RollMecak2020The). The TUBB gene is particularly significant in neurodevelopment, where it is highly expressed in neuronal progenitors and postmitotic neurons, contributing to neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Sferra2020TUBB). Mutations in TUBB have been implicated in various neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining proper microtubule dynamics and cellular integrity (Romaniello2015Mutations).

## Structure
The TUBB gene encodes the tubulin beta class I protein, a fundamental component of microtubules. The primary structure of TUBB consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of TUBB is a globular domain that facilitates interactions with alpha-tubulin, essential for microtubule assembly (Vemu2017Tubulin).

In terms of quaternary structure, TUBB forms a heterodimer with alpha-tubulin, which assembles into microtubules. This interaction is crucial for the dynamic properties of microtubules, influencing their growth and stability (RollMecak2020The). The C-terminal tail of TUBB is a site for various post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, glutamylation, and detyrosination. These modifications regulate microtubule dynamics, stability, and interactions with motor proteins and microtubule-associated proteins (RollMecak2020The).

The TUBB protein exhibits sequence variability, particularly in the C-terminal tails and polymerization interfaces, which affects microtubule structure and dynamics. This variability is a hotspot for sequence variation influenced by microtubule-targeting agents like taxol (RollMecak2020The).

## Function
The TUBB gene encodes the beta-tubulin protein, a critical component of microtubules in human cells. Microtubules are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Sferra2020TUBB). In healthy human cells, TUBB is involved in the polymerization and organization of microtubules, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and cell movement (Sferra2020TUBB). TUBB is highly expressed in neuronal progenitors and postmitotic neurons during fetal brain development, as well as in primary human fibroblasts, playing a significant role in neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation, and axon guidance (Sferra2020TUBB).

Microtubules, composed of tubulin proteins, are vital for neurogenesis and neuronal migration, influencing neuronal polarity, cell motility, and intracellular trafficking (Sferra2020TUBB). TUBB ensures proper microtubule dynamics, which is vital for maintaining cellular functions such as endocytosis, cell motility, and the spatial distribution of cellular components (Sferra2020TUBB). The gene's function is also linked to the efficient transport of molecules like N-cadherin to the cell membrane, crucial for cell migration during processes such as the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (Sferra2020TUBB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBB gene, which encodes a component of the microtubule structure, are associated with a range of neurological disorders. These mutations can lead to conditions such as complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations (CDCBM) and lissencephaly. Specific mutations in TUBB, such as those affecting the N-terminal domain, have been linked to circumferential skin creases Kunze type (CSC-KT), characterized by skin and facial abnormalities, microcephaly, and structural brain malformations like dysmorphic basal ganglia and corpus callosum dysgenesis (Dentici2018Intrafamiliar). 

The TUBB mutations can disrupt microtubule dynamics, affecting cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and cell motility. For instance, mutations like N52S and M73T impair microtubule polymerization and spatial organization, leading to altered vesicle transport and reduced cell migration rates (Sferra2020TUBB). These disruptions can contribute to the clinical phenotypes observed in affected individuals.

Alterations in TUBB expression or interactions may also impact cancer progression and drug resistance, although specific details on these effects are not provided in the context. Overall, TUBB mutations have significant implications for neurological development and function, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining cellular and structural integrity.

## Interactions
TUBB, or tubulin beta class I, is a protein that forms part of the microtubule structure in cells. It interacts with alpha-tubulin to form heterodimers, which polymerize into microtubules. TUBB is involved in interactions with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, which are essential for neuron migration, differentiation, and axon guidance (Romaniello2015Mutations). These interactions are crucial for the stability and dynamics of microtubules, which play specialized roles in neurons, particularly during cerebral development (Romaniello2015Mutations).

TUBB mutations can affect microtubule dynamics by altering residues that interact with GTP or are located at contact surfaces between heterodimers, leading to brain malformations (Romaniello2015Mutations). The N-terminal domain of TUBB includes a GTP binding pocket crucial for protein folding, stability, and microtubule dynamics (Romaniello2015Mutations). The intermediate domain facilitates longitudinal and lateral interactions necessary for heterodimer and microtubule stability, while the C-terminal domain is involved in interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (Romaniello2015Mutations).

TUBB also interacts with non-tubulin proteins, such as HTT and UNC5C, which are involved in neurodevelopment and microtubule stabilization (Ramesh2023Prediction). These interactions are regulated by posttranslational modifications like acetylation and phosphorylation, which influence microtubule dynamics and associated cellular processes (Ramesh2023Prediction).
