# ANKRD9

## Overview
ANKRD9 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 9 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for their role in facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The ankyrin repeat domain 9 protein is involved in the regulation of copper metabolism, particularly through its interaction with ATP7A, a protein essential for copper transport. This protein is implicated in maintaining the morphology of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and influencing lipid metabolism and membrane protein trafficking. The downregulation of ANKRD9 can lead to significant cellular changes, including increased cell size and altered TGN morphology, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and function (Malinouski2014Genomewide). Additionally, ANKRD9 has been associated with the modulation of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), a cytosolic enzyme with therapeutic relevance (Lee2022EWAS).

## Structure
ANKRD9 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common domains facilitating protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of ANKRD9 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. In terms of secondary structure, the protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of ANKRD9 involves the three-dimensional folding of these secondary elements, allowing the protein to achieve its functional form. While the quaternary structure would describe the assembly of multiple protein subunits, there is no specific information provided about this aspect for ANKRD9.

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms may influence the function and interactions of the ANKRD9 protein. These modifications can alter the protein's activity, localization, and interaction with other cellular components, although specific details on these modifications are not provided. The presence of ankyrin repeat motifs suggests a role in mediating interactions with other proteins, which is crucial for its biological functions. The structural characteristics of ANKRD9, including its ankyrin repeat domains, are essential for its role in cellular processes.

## Function
ANKRD9 is a gene that encodes a protein containing ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, ANKRD9 plays a significant role in the regulation of copper metabolism. It is involved in the regulation of ATP7A, a protein crucial for copper transport. Downregulation of ANKRD9 has been shown to lead to increased cell size and changes in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) morphology, as well as alterations in ATP7A post-translational modifications. Despite these changes, the molecular identity of the TGN remains intact, indicating that ANKRD9 is essential for maintaining TGN morphology (Malinouski2014Genomewide).

ANKRD9 is also implicated in lipid metabolism and may influence membrane protein trafficking and stabilization. Its downregulation results in a fragmented TGN and affects ATP7A's ability to pump excess copper out of the cell, suggesting that ANKRD9 might stabilize ATP7A's localization within the TGN (Malinouski2014Genomewide). These functions highlight ANKRD9's role in cellular copper homeostasis and its potential impact on cellular structure and function.

## Interactions
ANKRD9, a protein encoded by the ankyrin repeat domain 9 gene, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It has been implicated in the modulation of the intracellular properties of the cytosolic enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), facilitating its degradation. This interaction is particularly significant given that IMPDH2 is a therapeutic target for COVID-19, with the IMPDH inhibitor Ribavirin being used as an antiviral treatment (Lee2022EWAS).

ANKRD9 is also associated with copper homeostasis. It may influence the trafficking and stabilization of membrane proteins, such as ATP7A, a protein involved in copper metabolism. Downregulation of ANKRD9 in HeLa cells has been shown to lead to a fragmented trans-Golgi network and changes in ATP7A post-translational modification and protein levels. This suggests that ANKRD9 might bind to ATP7A, stabilizing its localization in the trans-Golgi network and affecting its ability to pump excess copper out of the cell (Malinouski2014Genomewide).

Despite these findings, specific physical interactions of ANKRD9 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available studies.
