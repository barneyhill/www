# PRKCZ

## Overview
PRKCZ is a gene that encodes the protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), a member of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) subfamily. PKCζ is a serine/threonine kinase involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell polarity, synaptic plasticity, and myelination. Unlike conventional PKC isoforms, PKCζ is not activated by diacylglycerol, which contributes to its unique regulatory mechanisms. The protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining cell polarity through its interaction with the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, influencing processes such as axon specification and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Additionally, PKCζ is crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, as well as oligodendrocyte differentiation in the central nervous system. Its involvement in various signaling pathways and cellular interactions underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Mercau2024Timeresolved; Zhang2022The; Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical).

## Structure
PRKCZ (protein kinase C zeta) is a member of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) subfamily, characterized by its unique structural domains. The protein contains a PB1 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in various signaling pathways. Unlike other protein kinase C family members, PRKCZ's C1 domain is atypical as it lacks sensitivity to diacylglycerol, a common activator in other PKC isoforms. This distinct feature contributes to its unique regulatory mechanisms.

The kinase domain of PRKCZ is responsible for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to phosphorylate target substrates, a key post-translational modification that modulates its function and activity. Phosphorylation is a common modification for PRKCZ, influencing its role in cellular processes.

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PRKCZ are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex three-dimensional conformation necessary for its function. The protein's structure is integral to its involvement in diverse cellular pathways, although specific structural motifs or folds are not detailed in the available information. The existence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned, indicating a potential area for further research.

## Function
PRKCZ encodes protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), an atypical protein kinase C involved in various cellular processes. PKCζ plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity by interacting with the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, which is essential for axon specification and neuronal polarization. This interaction is regulated by signaling pathways such as Wnt and TGFβ, which influence axon differentiation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Hapak2018PAR3–PAR6–atypical; Zhang2022The).

PKCζ is also involved in synaptic plasticity and memory. It is synthesized locally at synapses and contributes to the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) by being captured by synaptic 'tags.' Overexpression of PKCζ enhances long-term memory, while its inhibition can reverse LTP and erase memory. PKCζ works redundantly with atypical protein kinase C lambda (aPKCl) to ensure robust LTP and memory formation (Zhang2022The).

In the central nervous system, PKCζ is critical for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. It is necessary for the later stages of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin membrane specialization, which are essential for proper neuronal function. The absence of PKCζ leads to defects in myelination, highlighting its importance in CNS development (Mercau2024Timeresolved).

## Clinical Significance
The PRKCZ gene, encoding protein kinase C zeta, is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypermethylation of the PRKCZ gene promoter is observed, with 7 out of 9 CpG sites methylated in patients, compared to only one site in healthy controls. This hypermethylation correlates with decreased PRKCZ protein expression, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM by affecting insulin signaling and glucose transport (Zou2013Hypermethylation).

In cancer, PRKCZ expression is linked to aggressive phenotypes. In prostate cancer, a novel splice variant, PKC-z-PrC, is selectively expressed in malignant tissues and may promote cancer progression by bypassing normal regulatory mechanisms (Yao2012Splice). In breast cancer, high PKCζ expression is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Yin2014Association). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma, PKCζ expression correlates with disease progression and reduced survival, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis (Kim2019Clinical).

These findings underscore the importance of PRKCZ in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for disease progression.

## Interactions
PRKCZ (protein kinase C zeta) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It forms complexes with proteins such as PAR6, Akt2, and Cdc42, which are essential for cell migration and motility. These interactions facilitate the regulation of actin and myosin II, contributing to cell motility and the mechanical forces required for movement (Yao2010PRKC). PRKCZ also associates with Smurf1 to form a complex with Cdc42-PAR6, which is involved in membrane protrusions and the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of RHOA, impacting cell motility (Della2010RHOA).

In the context of cancer, PRKCZ interacts with the PAR complex, which includes PAR6, playing a role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (ReinaCampos2019The). It also phosphorylates proteins such as Hsp-27, which is necessary for cell motility (Yao2010PRKC). Additionally, PRKCZ is involved in metabolic reprogramming by phosphorylating PHGDH, inhibiting its activity and affecting metabolic pathways under nutrient stress conditions (Ma2013Control). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRKCZ in cellular dynamics and cancer progression.
