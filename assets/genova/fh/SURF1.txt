# SURF1

## Overview
The SURF1 gene encodes the SURF1 cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its two transmembrane domains, which anchor it to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The SURF1 protein is essential for the proper assembly and function of COX, facilitating the final step of the electron transport chain where electrons are transferred from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process crucial for ATP production and energy metabolism in cells (Zhu1998SURF1; Lee2021Clinical). Mutations in the SURF1 gene are associated with various mitochondrial disorders, most notably Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized by COX deficiency and impaired energy metabolism (Zhu1998SURF1; Tiranti1998Mutations). The study of SURF1 and its interactions is critical for understanding mitochondrial function and the pathogenesis of related diseases.

## Structure
The SURF1 protein is a mitochondrial protein involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The protein is 300 amino acids long and contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence at its amino terminus, indicating its localization to the mitochondrial inner membrane (Zhu1998SURF1). The SURF1 protein has two predicted transmembrane domains located near the N and C termini, which are highly conserved across species such as humans, mice, and Fugu rubripes (Zhu1998SURF1; Tiranti1998Mutations). These domains suggest that the protein is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The primary structure of SURF1 shows homology with the yeast SHY1 protein, with a 25.6% overall amino acid homology and a region of greatest homology between amino acids 37 and 248, where the sequences are 33% identical (Zhu1998SURF1). The protein's structure includes a large central domain that projects into the intermembrane space, which is essential for its function in COX assembly (Bestwick2010Analysis). Mutations in SURF1 often result in truncated proteins, particularly affecting the C-terminal transmembrane domain, which is crucial for the protein's function (Zhu1998SURF1).

## Function
The SURF1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV, which is a vital component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is essential for the proper assembly and function of COX, facilitating the final step of the electron transport chain where electrons are transferred from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process crucial for ATP production and energy metabolism in cells (Zhu1998SURF1; Lee2021Clinical).

In healthy human cells, SURF1 is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is involved in the biogenesis of the COX complex. It is thought to assist in the assembly or maintenance of an active COX holoenzyme, ensuring the stability and function of the electron transport chain (Zhu1998SURF1). The protein contains two transmembrane domains, which are important for its function within the mitochondria (Lee2021Clinical).

The proper function of SURF1 is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial respiration and energy production, which are essential for cellular and organismal health. Mutations in SURF1 can lead to deficiencies in COX activity, resulting in impaired energy metabolism and associated disorders (Kovářová2012Adaptation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SURF1 gene are primarily associated with Leigh syndrome (LS), a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by necrotic lesions in the central nervous system, particularly affecting the basal ganglia and brainstem. These mutations lead to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, which is a hallmark of LS and results in impaired energy production in mitochondria (Zhu1998SURF1; Tiranti1998Mutations). The majority of patients with SURF1 mutations present with symptoms in infancy, including developmental delay, hypotonia, and central respiratory failure, often leading to early mortality (Wedatilake2013SURF1).

SURF1 mutations are also linked to other conditions beyond classical LS. For instance, some patients with SURF1 mutations exhibit isolated leukodystrophy, characterized by diffuse white matter changes in the brain, rather than the typical LS presentation (Rahman2001A). Additionally, SURF1 mutations have been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 (CMT4), a demyelinating neuropathy, where patients present with severe childhood-onset neuropathy and lactic acidosis (EchanizLaguna2013SURF1).

Despite the genetic basis of these conditions, the molecular mechanisms by which SURF1 mutations lead to neurological impairment remain poorly understood, and there are currently no treatments targeting the pathogenicity of these diseases (Inak2019SURF1).

## Interactions
The SURF1 protein is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It interacts with several proteins during this process. SURF1 is suggested to facilitate the association of the Cox2 subunit with the Cox1-Cox4-Cox5a subassembly, which is an early stage in COX assembly (Kovářová2012Adaptation). The yeast homolog of SURF1, Shy1p, interacts with mitochondrial COX assembly factors, indicating a role in stabilizing fully assembled COX subunits (Bundschuh2009Surf1).

SURF1 is also implicated in the maturation of the heme a3 site in COX, and its absence can lead to the proteolytic degradation of stalled assembly intermediates (Bestwick2010Analysis). The protein may modulate heme synthase activity and chaperone heme a to its target sites in COX subunit I (Bundschuh2009Surf1). In yeast, the G137E mutation in Shy1, a homolog of SURF1, affects heme a insertion and mitochondrial copper levels, with COA2, COA4, and COX10 identified as suppressors of the resulting respiratory defect (Bestwick2010Analysis). These interactions highlight SURF1's critical role in COX assembly and function.
