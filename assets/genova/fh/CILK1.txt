# CILK1

## Overview
CILK1, or ciliogenesis associated kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of primary cilia formation and function. The protein product of CILK1, also referred to as ciliogenesis associated kinase 1, plays a pivotal role in controlling the length and assembly of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and environmental sensing. This kinase is characterized by an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and substrate interactions, respectively (Fu2019Ciliogenesis; Limerick2024An). CILK1 is involved in several signaling pathways, including the mTORC1 and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways, through its interactions with various proteins such as KIF3A, Raptor, and GSK3b (Wang2020Functional; Fu2019Ciliogenesis). Mutations in the CILK1 gene have been linked to ciliopathies and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance in human health and disease (Fu2019Ciliogenesis; Limerick2024An).

## Structure
Ciliogenesis associated kinase 1 (CILK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with a defined domain structure. The protein consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1-284) and a C-terminal domain (residues 285-632) that is intrinsically disordered (Fu2019Ciliogenesis; Limerick2024An). The N-terminal domain shares significant homology with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and includes a serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, a catalytic specificity loop, and two phosphorylation activation loops (He2024Ciliogenesisassociated). The C-terminal domain is crucial for substrate recognition and is predicted to be a random coil, lacking a well-defined three-dimensional structure (Fu2019Ciliogenesis).

CILK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at Thr157 and Tyr159, which are essential for its activation (He2024Ciliogenesisassociated). The protein also contains nuclear-localization-signal sites and a proline-rich region (He2024Ciliogenesisassociated). Pathogenic mutations in the catalytic domain, such as E80K, G120C, and R272Q, are associated with ciliopathies, while other variants are linked to epilepsy (Fu2019Ciliogenesis). The intrinsically disordered region of the C-terminal domain is important for interactions with scaffold proteins like KATNIP, which stabilize and activate CILK1 (Limerick2024An).

## Function
Ciliogenesis-associated kinase 1 (CILK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in the regulation of primary cilia formation and length in healthy human cells. CILK1 predominantly localizes to the base of the primary cilium, where it restricts the formation and elongation of these structures, which are essential for sensing and transducing environmental and hormonal signals (Wang2020Functional). The primary cilium is a dynamic organelle that is resorbed and reassembled during each cell division cycle, contributing to tissue development and homeostasis (Wang2020Functional).

CILK1 is involved in several molecular processes, including the phosphorylation of kinesin family member 3A (KIF3A), which is crucial for cilia regulation (Wang2020Functional). It also interacts with the mTORC1 signaling pathway by phosphorylating Raptor, a component of mTORC1, which is essential for cell growth and proliferation (Fu2019Ciliogenesis). CILK1's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, and it interacts with substrates like KIF3A, Scythe, Raptor, and GSK3b, which are involved in cilia structure and function (Fu2019Ciliogenesis).

In the context of organismal outcomes, CILK1 is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes and development in various tissues. Its dysfunction can lead to significant pathophysiological outcomes, including ciliopathies and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Fu2019Ciliogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CILK1 gene are associated with several human diseases, particularly ciliopathies and epilepsy. Ciliopathies are a group of genetic disorders characterized by defects in the primary cilium, an organelle involved in sensing environmental cues and signal transduction. Specific mutations in CILK1, such as E80K, G120C, and R272Q, have been linked to endocrine-cerebro-osteodysplasia (ECO) syndrome, a neonatal-lethal disorder with symptoms including lung hypoplasia and skeletal abnormalities like polydactyly and short ribs (Fu2019Ciliogenesis; Paige2016An). The R272Q mutation is particularly noted for its role in ECO syndrome, affecting the kinase's structural conformation and disrupting interactions that stabilize its active form (Fu2019Ciliogenesis).

CILK1 mutations are also implicated in epilepsy, specifically juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Variants such as A615T, I102L, K220E, and K305T are associated with this condition, with the A615T mutation affecting the regulation of CILK1 by the scaffold protein KATNIP, leading to impaired primary cilia and Hedgehog signaling (Limerick2024An).

In cancer, high expression of CILK1 is linked to tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance, particularly in breast cancer and small-cell lung cancer (He2024Ciliogenesisassociated).

## Interactions
Ciliogenesis-associated kinase 1 (CILK1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CILK1 directly phosphorylates ERK1 at the Thr-202 site, a key interaction in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, which is important for cell cycle progression, migration, survival, and differentiation (He2024Ciliogenesisassociated). It also interacts with Scythe, a co-chaperone protein, phosphorylating it at Thr-1080, which suggests a regulatory role in autophagy and ciliogenesis (Fu2019Ciliogenesis). CILK1 phosphorylates Glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) at Thr7, enhancing Ser9 phosphorylation and promoting autoinhibition of GSK3b, thereby suppressing cilia formation and Hedgehog signaling (Fu2019Ciliogenesis).

CILK1 is involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system by phosphorylating KIF3A at Thr672, potentially regulating ciliogenesis (Fu2019Ciliogenesis). It also interacts with the mTORC1 signaling pathway by phosphorylating Raptor at Thr908, necessary for mTORC1 activation (Fu2019Ciliogenesis). In the context of hypoplastic left heart syndrome and ciliopathies, CILK1 interacts with RPTOR, indicating a role in protein-protein interactions related to these conditions (Karunakaran2022Novel). These interactions highlight CILK1's involvement in various signaling pathways and its potential impact on disease mechanisms.
