# ETNPPL

## Overview
ETNPPL is a gene that encodes the enzyme ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase, which is a key player in phospholipid metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of phosphoethanolamine, a precursor in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, an essential component of cellular membranes. The activity of ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of cell membranes, influencing lipid composition and cellular signaling pathways. ETNPPL is predominantly expressed in the brain and liver, with significant roles in astrocytes related to synaptic plasticity and gap junctions. The enzyme is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but has also been detected in the nuclei, suggesting additional functions beyond its enzymatic activity. Dysregulation of ETNPPL has been associated with various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including gliomas and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Schiroli2013Strict; Tsujioka2023Utilization; Leventoux2020Transformation).

## Function
ETNPPL, or ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in phospholipid metabolism by catalyzing the breakdown of phosphoethanolamine, a key compound in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, a major component of cellular membranes (Leventoux2020Transformation). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and function, influencing cellular lipid composition and signaling pathways (Schiroli2013Strict).

ETNPPL is primarily expressed in the brain and liver, with its expression in the human brain largely restricted to mature astrocytes (Leventoux2020Transformation). In astrocytes, ETNPPL is involved in lipid metabolism and is associated with genes involved in synaptic plasticity and gap junctions, such as Agt and Gjb6 (Tsujioka2023Utilization). The enzyme's activity is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but it has also been detected in the nuclei of cells, suggesting additional roles beyond its known enzymatic activity (Tsujioka2023Utilization).

ETNPPL's function is tightly regulated and confined to specific metabolic pathways, which is crucial for its role in maintaining phospholipid metabolism balance, potentially impacting neuropsychiatric conditions (Schiroli2013Strict).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ETNPPL gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. In the context of gliomas, particularly IDH1-mutated gliomas, ETNPPL expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade. Its downregulation is associated with increased glioma progression, while overexpression of ETNPPL has been shown to reduce glioma cell growth, suggesting its role as a negative regulator of glioma proliferation (Leventoux2020Transformation). 

ETNPPL is also linked to psychiatric disorders. Transcriptomic studies have identified its upregulation in conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indicating a potential role in these diseases (Tsujioka2023Utilization). The gene's expression changes in response to various central nervous system injuries, such as spinal cord injury and stroke, suggesting its involvement in the body's response to neural damage (Tsujioka2023Utilization).

In addition, ETNPPL is involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the catabolism of phosphoethanolamine, which is crucial for membrane synthesis. Dysregulation of this metabolic pathway may contribute to the malignant progression of gliomas and other neurological disorders (Raffler2015GenomeWide; Leventoux2020Transformation).
