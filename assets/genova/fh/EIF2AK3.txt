# EIF2AK3

## Overview
The EIF2AK3 gene encodes the protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3, commonly referred to as PERK, which is a transmembrane protein kinase. PERK plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by participating in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Upon activation by misfolded proteins accumulating in the ER, PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), leading to a reduction in general protein synthesis and facilitating the selective translation of stress-related proteins. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proteostasis, particularly in tissues with high secretory demands such as pancreatic beta cells and bone tissue. Mutations in the EIF2AK3 gene are linked to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome and have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (English2021A; Zhao2021Identification; Stockwell2012MechanismBased).

## Structure
The EIF2AK3 gene encodes a protein kinase known as PERK, which plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response. The primary structure of EIF2AK3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional configuration. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of EIF2AK3 forms a kinase domain, essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (EIF2A), a critical step in regulating protein synthesis during endoplasmic reticulum stress (Stockwell2012MechanismBased).

The quaternary structure of EIF2AK3 involves dimerization, which is necessary for its activation and function. Key domains of the protein include the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain, which are vital for its regulatory and catalytic activities, respectively. Common post-translational modifications of EIF2AK3 include phosphorylation, which modulates its activity and function in response to cellular stress (Sümegi2020A).

Splice variant isoforms of EIF2AK3 may exist, potentially affecting its function and regulation, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The EIF2AK3 gene encodes the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), which plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In healthy human cells, PERK is a transmembrane enzyme that is highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and bone tissue. It is activated by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, leading to the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) (Zhao2021Identification; Stockwell2012MechanismBased).

This phosphorylation event reduces general protein synthesis, allowing the cell to focus on producing proteins that aid in stress resolution, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sümegi2020A). PERK also enhances the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which regulates autophagy, amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (Zhao2021Identification). In addition to its role in stress response, PERK is involved in normal fetal and early beta cell proliferation, differentiation, proinsulin processing, and bone development (Zhao2021Identification).

PERK's activity is crucial for managing ER stress and maintaining proteostasis, which includes the management of protein folding and degradation within the ER (Saptarshi2022PERKEIF2AK3). This function is essential for preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can be detrimental to cell health (Stockwell2012MechanismBased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2AK3 gene are primarily associated with Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by early-onset insulin-dependent diabetes, skeletal dysplasia, and liver dysfunction. Patients may also experience renal impairment, intellectual disability, neutropenia, and hypothyroidism (English2021A; Fatani2019EIF2AK3; Brickwood2003WolcottRallison). The mutations in EIF2AK3 often result in truncated proteins that lack functional kinase domains, leading to a loss of function and impaired cellular stress response (Iyer2004Wolcott‐Rallison; Brickwood2003WolcottRallison).

In addition to WRS, EIF2AK3 mutations have been linked to tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by tau protein aggregates. Genome-wide association studies have identified EIF2AK3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimer's disease (English2021A). The dysfunction in EIF2AK3 can lead to reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α, affecting the integrated stress response and contributing to neurodegenerative features (English2021A).

The clinical manifestations of EIF2AK3 mutations are variable, with some mutations leading to severe phenotypes and others resulting in milder symptoms. This variability complicates the genotype-phenotype correlation in WRS (Sümegi2020A; AlShawi2013Variable).

## Interactions
EIF2AK3, also known as PERK, is a key player in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and interacts with several proteins to mediate its functions. One of its primary interactions is with the chaperone protein HSPA5/GRP78/BIP. Under normal conditions, HSPA5 binds to EIF2AK3, preventing its oligomerization and activation. Upon endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, HSPA5 dissociates from EIF2AK3, allowing EIF2AK3 to oligomerize and autophosphorylate, which is crucial for its activation (Stockwell2012MechanismBased).

Once activated, EIF2AK3 phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (EIF2A) on Ser51, leading to a reduction in global protein synthesis and the selective translation of specific mRNAs, such as ATF4. ATF4 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in stress responses, including those related to autophagy (Stockwell2012MechanismBased; Wang2014Hepatitis).

EIF2AK3 also interacts with DDIT3 (also known as CHOP), which is upregulated as part of the stress response. DDIT3 contributes to the regulation of autophagy by upregulating LC3B expression, a key marker of autophagy (Wang2014Hepatitis). These interactions highlight EIF2AK3's role in managing cellular stress and maintaining homeostasis.
