# HLA-DMB

## Overview
The HLA-DMB gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, specifically functioning as a non-classical MHC class II molecule. The protein, known as major histocompatibility complex, class II, DM beta, plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD4+ T lymphocytes. This process is essential for the activation of the adaptive immune response. HLA-DMB forms a heterodimer with HLA-DMA, and this complex is involved in the removal of invariant chain peptides and the stabilization of peptide-MHC class II complexes within the endosomal/lysosomal compartments of antigen-presenting cells. The protein's function is crucial for effective antigen processing and presentation, impacting immune recognition and response (Denzin1994Assembly; Shaman1995Analysis).

## Structure
The HLA-DMB gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, specifically involved in the antigen presentation process. The HLA-DMB protein is composed of six exons, each encoding different regions of the protein. Exon 1 encodes the 5' untranslated region and the leader sequence, exon 2 encodes the beta 1 domain, and exon 3 encodes the beta 2 domain. Exon 4 encodes the connecting peptide, transmembrane region, and part of the cytoplasmic tail, while exons 5 and 6 encode segments of the cytoplasmic tail and the 3' untranslated region (Shaman1995Analysis).

The protein structure includes unique disulfide bonds, such as the C25-C35 bond in the DMβ chain, which is crucial for maintaining the functional integrity of the HLA-DM complex and facilitating antigen presentation (van2006The). The DMβ chain also contains glycosylation sites, which are important for its proper folding and stability (van2006The). The HLA-DMB protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interaction with other MHC class II molecules (Shaman1995Analysis).

## Function
The HLA-DMB gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system's antigen presentation process. It is part of the HLA-DM locus, which is involved in the regulation of antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In healthy human cells, HLA-DMB assists in the formation of intracellular complexes of HLA-DR, -DQ, or -DP molecules with peptides derived from endocytosed proteins. This process is essential for the proper loading of antigenic peptides onto MHC class II molecules, facilitating their presentation to CD4+ T lymphocytes (Shaman1995Analysis).

HLA-DMB functions as an accessory molecule in the class II presentation pathway, aiding in the removal of invariant chain (Ii) peptides and facilitating peptide loading or trafficking of conventional class II MHC molecules. This role is critical for the formation of stable class II molecule/peptide complexes, which are necessary for effective immune recognition and response (Shaman1995Analysis).

The protein is primarily active within the endosomal/lysosomal compartments of antigen-presenting cells, where it interacts with other components of the MHC class II pathway to ensure efficient antigen processing and presentation (WU1999HLADMB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HLA-DMB gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a study identified the intronic variant rs6902982 in the HLA-DMB gene as significantly increasing the risk of developing KS in individuals co-infected with HIV-1 and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). This variant was associated with a fourfold increase in risk, highlighting the gene's role in the pathogenesis of KS through its involvement in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules (Aissani2014SNP).

In autoimmune diseases, HLA-DMB expression has been studied in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune thyroid diseases. Although the HLA-DMB*0103 phenotype was found to be more prevalent in MS patients, this association was secondary to the linkage with the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele, suggesting that HLA-DMB may not play a major independent role in MS susceptibility (Bennetts1999HLADMB). In thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, HLA-DMB expression in thyrocytes suggests a potential role in antigen presentation, contributing to autoimmunity (WU1999HLADMB). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in immune response modulation and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
HLA-DMB forms a stable heterodimer with HLA-DMA, which is crucial for its function in antigen processing. This heterodimer is involved in the intracellular processes that facilitate class II-restricted antigen processing, although it is not expressed on the cell surface (Denzin1994Assembly). The DMα and DMβ chains cooperate to ensure proper folding and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with the DMβ C25-C35 disulfide bond playing a critical role in maintaining the functional integrity of the HLA-DM complex (van2006The).

HLA-DM interacts with HLA-DO, forming complexes that are more efficient in stabilizing empty DR4 molecules compared to HLA-DM alone. This interaction enhances the chaperone activity of HLA-DM, preventing inactivation at low pH and making the peptide editing process more stringent (Kropshofer1998A). HLA-DM also facilitates the dissociation of CLIP from MHC class II αβ dimers, a necessary step for peptide binding, indicating a direct physical interaction with the αβCLIP complexes (Denzin1995HLADM).

HLA-DM's interaction with HLA-DO is essential for the efficient intracellular transport of HLA-DO, as HLA-DO requires association with HLA-DM to exit the ER and reach lysosomal compartments (Liljedahl1996HLADO).
