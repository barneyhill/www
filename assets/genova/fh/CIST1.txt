# CIST1

## Overview
CIST1 is a gene that encodes the protein colon, intestine, and stomach enriched 1, which is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The expression pattern of CIST1 suggests a role in the development or maintenance of the gastrointestinal tissues, potentially influencing cellular differentiation or proliferation. Further research is needed to clarify its interactions and pathways, as well as its implications in health and disease.
