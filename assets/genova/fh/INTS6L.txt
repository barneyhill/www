# INTS6L

## Overview
The INTS6L gene encodes the protein integrator complex subunit 6-like, which is a component of the integrator complex. This complex is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. The integrator complex subunit 6-like protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in transcriptional regulation processes. It is implicated in various cellular functions, including the modulation of RNA polymerase II activity, which is essential for the transcription of snRNA genes. The precise biological mechanisms and pathways involving INTS6L are still under investigation, but its role in gene expression regulation suggests potential implications in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
