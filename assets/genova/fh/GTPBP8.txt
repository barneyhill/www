# GTPBP8

## Overview
GTPBP8 is a gene that encodes the putative GTP binding protein 8, a small GTPase involved in mitochondrial function. The protein is characterized by its GTPase activity, which is essential for its role in the assembly of mitoribosomes, the mitochondrial ribosomes responsible for protein synthesis within mitochondria (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). GTP binding protein 8 is categorized as an RNA-binding protein, specifically interacting with the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA, which is crucial for the maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). The protein's function is vital for mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energy production, and its absence can lead to significant defects in mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). Additionally, alterations in GTPBP8 expression have been implicated in various cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Hu2022Pancancer).

## Structure
GTPBP8 is a small protein of less than 200 amino acids, featuring a G-domain and a short C-terminal α-helix. It also includes an approximately 90 amino acid-long N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, which directs the protein to the mitochondria (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). The G-domain of GTPBP8 contains five motifs, including the conserved Walker A motif, which is responsible for nucleotide binding, a characteristic feature of GTP-binding proteins (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). This domain is crucial for the protein's GTPase activity, which is essential for its function in mitoribosome assembly (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).

The C-terminal α-helix is highly charged and plays a significant role in binding to the mitochondrial ribosome large subunit, similar to its bacterial homolog EngB (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). GTPBP8 is identified as an RNA-binding protein, specifically interacting with the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA, which is critical for its role in mitoribosome formation (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). Despite its involvement in mitoribosome biogenesis, direct structural data on GTPBP8's interaction with the mitoribosome is limited, possibly due to experimental constraints (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).

## Function
GTPBP8 is a crucial component in the formation of mitoribosomes within human mitochondria, playing a significant role in mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energy production. It is involved in the maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) by specifically interacting with the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA (mt-rRNA) (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). GTPBP8 functions as an RNA-binding protein and is essential for the proper assembly and stability of mitoribosomes, which are necessary for mitochondrial translation (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).

The absence of GTPBP8 leads to defects in mitoribosome assembly, resulting in impaired mitochondrial translation and a significant oxidative phosphorylation defect (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). This impairment is characterized by the accumulation of mitoribosomal large subunit assembly intermediates that cannot form functional monosomes (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). GTPBP8's GTPase activity is vital for its function, as demonstrated by the restoration of mitochondrial translation and monosome formation upon re-expression of wild-type GTPBP8 in knockout cells (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). Overall, GTPBP8 is essential for the proper assembly and function of mitoribosomes, contributing to mitochondrial protein synthesis and overall mitochondrial function.

## Clinical Significance
GTPBP8 has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction, which can potentially lead to mitochondrial diseases. The absence of GTPBP8 results in significant defects in mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), characterized by inhibited translation and notable OxPhos defects without a general transcriptional defect. This dysfunction is linked to the downregulation of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and reduced levels of 16 S and 12 S mitochondrial rRNAs, leading to impaired mitoribosome assembly and function (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). The accumulation of early mt-LSU assembly intermediates and the absence of fully matured mt-LSU subunits further highlight the critical role of GTPBP8 in mitoribosome biogenesis (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).

Alterations in GTPBP8 expression or function may also be relevant to cancer. The GTPBP family, including GTPBP8, is differentially expressed across various cancer types, often showing upregulation. This suggests a potential role in cancer progression and tumorigenesis, possibly through involvement in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Hu2022Pancancer). The differential expression of GTPBP8 in immune subtypes and its correlation with immune scores indicate a possible influence on the tumor microenvironment, affecting cancer prognosis (Hu2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
GTPBP8 is an RNA-binding protein that specifically interacts with the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA (mt-rRNA) of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU). This interaction is crucial for the maturation and stability of the mt-LSU, as evidenced by the impaired assembly of mt-LSU in GTPBP8 knock-out cells (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). GTPBP8 colocalizes with mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs) in human cells, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial RNA metabolism and ribosome assembly (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).

Mass spectrometry analysis has identified several proteins involved in RNA metabolism and mitoribosome assembly as GTPBP8 binding partners, including TRMT10C, MTPAP, and MTERF1 (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). Proximity labeling assays have confirmed the enrichment of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, particularly from the mt-LSU, in the GTPBP8 interactome (Cipullo2024GTPBP8). Despite these interactions, no direct binding between GTPBP8 and mt-LSU mitochondrial ribosomal proteins has been observed, suggesting that GTPBP8's role in mitoribosome assembly is primarily RNA-mediated (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).

The absence of GTPBP8 leads to a reduction in the levels of 16 S and 12 S mt-rRNAs and a downregulation of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Cipullo2024GTPBP8).
