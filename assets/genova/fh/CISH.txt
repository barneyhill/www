# CISH

## Overview
The CISH gene encodes the cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein, a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. This protein plays a pivotal role as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, particularly through the JAK-STAT pathway, by modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis. The CISH protein is characterized by a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a carboxy-terminal SOCS box, which are essential for its function in binding phosphorylated tyrosine residues and facilitating ubiquitination processes (Guittard2018The). CISH is involved in various cellular interactions, including those with cytokine receptors and signaling molecules, which underscore its role in feedback inhibition and immune regulation (Yoshimura1995A). The gene's expression and regulation are critical in contexts such as cancer and inflammatory diseases, where alterations in CISH levels can significantly impact disease progression and immune responses (Peng2020MiR944CISH; Takeshima2019CISH).

## Structure
The CISH protein, a member of the SOCS family, is characterized by a conserved structure that includes a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a carboxy-terminal SOCS box. The SH2 domain is crucial for binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target molecules, facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Guittard2018The). The SOCS box interacts with components of the ubiquitination machinery, such as elongin B/C, cullins, and ring-box 2, forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Guittard2018The).

The primary structure of CISH includes an amino-terminal domain of variable length, which contributes to the protein's functional diversity (Guittard2018The). The SH2 domain is essential for the regulation of PLC-γ1 in TCR-stimulated CD8+ T cells, as mutations in this domain significantly reduce PLC-γ1 ubiquitination (Guittard2018The). The protein's structure does not include an SH3 domain, and its N- and C-terminal regions are rich in proline and leucine, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions (Yoshimura1995A).

CISH is involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling pathways, and its expression is modulated in response to various immune stimuli (Maehr2014Four). The presence of multiple CISH paralogues in species like rainbow trout suggests potential functional diversification (Maehr2014Four). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CISH gene encodes the cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein, which is a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. This protein functions primarily as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, particularly through the JAK-STAT pathway. In healthy human cells, CISH is involved in modulating immune responses by inhibiting the activity of Janus kinases (JAKs) and preventing the binding of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) to cytokine receptors. This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Seyfarth2018CISH; Kotas2021CISH).

CISH is highly expressed in type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and plays a critical role in constraining their proliferation, activation, and cytokine production. It is involved in reducing tonic type 2 immune tone at mucosal barriers, which is essential for balanced immune responses (Kotas2021CISH). In T cells, CISH acts as a feedback inhibitor in the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling pathway, which is important for regulatory T cell function. It inhibits IL-2R signaling by binding to the IL-2Rβ chain and blocking STAT5 phosphorylation, thus preventing overactivation of T cells (Seyfarth2018CISH).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CISH gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory conditions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), CISH is significantly downregulated, which is associated with increased STAT3 phosphorylation and enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion. This downregulation is partly due to the overexpression of miR-944, which directly targets CISH, leading to a pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic environment. The miR-944/CISH/STAT3 signaling pathway is crucial in OSCC progression, especially in cases linked to cigarette smoking, where miR-944 levels are elevated (Peng2020MiR944CISH).

In bronchial asthma, CISH acts as a negative regulator of IL-13-induced CCL26 production in lung fibroblasts. Its expression is induced by IL-13, and it plays a role in controlling eosinophilic inflammation, a hallmark of asthma. Reduced CISH expression leads to increased CCL26 production, suggesting that CISH could be a therapeutic target for managing eosinophilic inflammation in severe asthma (Takeshima2019CISH).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CISH in regulating inflammatory responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by altered cytokine signaling.

## Interactions
CISH (cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein) is involved in several interactions that modulate cytokine signaling pathways. It contains an SH2 domain that allows it to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated cytokine receptors, such as the interleukin 3 (IL3) and erythropoietin (EPO) receptors. This binding suggests a role in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling by potentially masking phosphotyrosine residues on activated receptors, thereby modulating signaling pathways that involve SH2 domains (Yoshimura1995A).

CISH is also a target of the JAK-STAT5 pathway and acts as a feedback modulator of STAT5 activation. It is induced by STAT5 and negatively modulates STAT5 activation by suppressing EPO-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Matsumoto1997CIS). The promoter region of the CISH gene contains multiple STAT5 binding sites, which are essential for its regulation (Matsumoto1997CIS).

In T cells, CISH interacts with PLC-γ1, a key molecule in T cell receptor signaling. The SH2 domain of CISH is crucial for binding to PLC-γ1, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation, which inhibits T cell receptor signaling (Guittard2018The). This interaction acts as a checkpoint in CD8+ T cell tumor immunotherapy by regulating calcium release and cytokine expression (Guittard2018The).
