# SRPK3

## Overview
SRPK3, or SRSF protein kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase, which is a type of kinase involved in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. This kinase plays a pivotal role in muscle development and function by phosphorylating serine/arginine-rich domain proteins, thereby influencing their interactions and localization within the cell. SRPK3 is predominantly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle, where it is regulated by the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), and is essential for maintaining normal muscle growth and homeostasis. Beyond its role in muscle tissue, SRPK3 is also involved in B lymphocyte development and the regulation of immune responses, affecting mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism. Mutations in the SRPK3 gene have been linked to various muscle-related diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Kim2023Eye; Arends2019SRPK3; Nakagawa2005Centronuclear).

## Function
SRPK3 (SRSF protein kinase 3) is a serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase that plays a critical role in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, a process essential for diversifying the cellular proteome. This kinase phosphorylates serine/arginine-rich domain proteins, which are crucial for mRNA splicing, affecting their interactions and localization within the cell (Arends2019SRPK3; Nakagawa2005Centronuclear). SRPK3 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences muscle-specific gene expression and is essential for muscle development and function (Xu2010Molecular).

In muscle cells, SRPK3 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for muscle differentiation and development. It is specifically expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle, where it is regulated by the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) (Nakagawa2005Centronuclear). The kinase's activity is crucial for maintaining normal muscle growth and homeostasis, as evidenced by its role in phosphorylating proteins involved in mRNA splicing, which is implicated in various muscle diseases (Nakagawa2005Centronuclear).

SRPK3 also plays a role in B lymphocyte development and humoral immune responses by regulating alternative splicing events necessary for B cell maturation and function (Arends2019SRPK3). Its activity affects mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism, which are important for the proper functioning of immune cells (Arends2019SRPK3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRPK3 gene have been implicated in several muscle-related diseases. SRPK3 is associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), where mutations lead to eye movement defects in zebrafish models, highlighting its role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Kim2023Eye). In the context of muscle pathology, SRPK3 mutations, when combined with variants in the TTN gene, result in a specific form of skeletal muscle myopathy. This digenic inheritance pattern is characterized by severe muscle pathology, including disrupted sarcomere structure and myofibrillar disorganization, as observed in zebrafish models (Töpf2024Digenic). 

In humans, this myopathy presents with poor motor performance, predominantly affecting proximal and axial muscles, and can include respiratory compromise and dilated cardiomyopathy (Töpf2024Digenic). SRPK3-null mice exhibit a type 2 fiber-specific myopathy with increased centrally placed nuclei, a hallmark of centronuclear myopathy, suggesting its crucial role in muscle growth and homeostasis (Nakagawa2005Centronuclear). Overexpression of SRPK3 in transgenic mice leads to severe muscle defects, including myofiber degeneration and early lethality, indicating that both loss and gain of SRPK3 function can disrupt normal muscle development (Nakagawa2005Centronuclear).

## Interactions
SRPK3 (SRSF protein kinase 3) is involved in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing through its interactions with serine/arginine-rich proteins, particularly SR proteins. It phosphorylates these proteins, which are crucial for directing exon inclusion and skipping during splicing events. This phosphorylation activity is essential for the regulation of alternative splicing outcomes, impacting the generation of alternative protein isoforms or mRNA stability (Arends2019SRPK3). SRPK3 specifically binds to 'GCAG' motifs in pre-mRNAs, influencing splicing regulation by interacting with SR proteins that recognize these motifs (Arends2019SRPK3).

In the context of B lymphocyte development, SRPK3's role in splicing regulation affects several signaling pathways, including ATM signaling, DNA damage response, and cell cycle checkpoints in immature B cells, as well as ERK5, AMPK, mTOR, and TGF-b signaling in mature B cells (Arends2019SRPK3). These interactions are crucial for processes such as V(D)J recombination and mature B cell survival (Arends2019SRPK3). While the context does not provide specific details on direct protein-protein interactions beyond SR proteins, SRPK3's regulatory influence on splicing and signaling pathways suggests its involvement in complex cellular processes.
