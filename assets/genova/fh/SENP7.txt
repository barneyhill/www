# SENP7

## Overview
SENP7 is a gene that encodes the protein SUMO specific peptidase 7, a member of the SENP family of cysteine proteases. This protein is categorized as a SUMO-2/3-specific isopeptidase, which plays a pivotal role in the deSUMOylation process, crucial for maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis. The SENP7 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates the removal of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 from target proteins, facilitating processes such as chromatin relaxation and DNA repair (Claessens2024SUMO; Shen2009Characterization). SENP7's activity is essential for preventing excessive SUMOylation, which can disrupt protein degradation and cellular health (Claessens2024SUMO). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including tumor suppression and immune response modulation (Zhang2024SENP7; Wu2022SENP7).

## Structure
SENP7 is a member of the SENP family of cysteine proteases, characterized by a catalytic domain with a papain-like fold, typical of clan CA cysteine proteases (Kunz2018SUMOspecific). This domain includes a catalytic triad composed of cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues, essential for its enzymatic activity (Shen2009Characterization). SENP7 has a unique structural feature with four conserved loop insertions, which are absent in other SENPs, contributing to its specificity for SUMO2/3-conjugated substrates (Kunz2018SUMOspecific).

SENP7 exists in at least two isoforms: SENP7L and SENP7S. SENP7L is nuclear and contains a conserved heterochromatin protein 1 homolog (HP1)-box (PxVxL), facilitating its recruitment to heterochromatin, while SENP7S lacks this domain and is localized in the cytosol (Kunz2018SUMOspecific; Karami2017Novel). The SENP7S isoform has a nuclear export sequence, which aids in its cytosolic localization (Karami2017Novel).

The regulation of SENP7 includes targeting for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP, which may influence its function in cellular senescence (Kunz2018SUMOspecific). The N-terminal region of SENP7, which varies between isoforms, plays a role in its subcellular localization and function (Kunz2018SUMOspecific).

## Function
SENP7 (SUMO specific peptidase 7) is a SUMO-2/3-specific isopeptidase that plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates the deSUMOylation of proteins, particularly those conjugated with SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, but not SUMO-1 (Shen2009Characterization). SENP7 is involved in the relaxation of chromatin to facilitate homologous recombination, a key DNA repair process. It achieves this by removing SUMO2/3 from KAP1, allowing chromatin remodelers to interact with chromatin, which is essential for proper DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Claessens2024SUMO; Tokarz2021SENP).

SENP7 also plays a role in regulating the dynamics of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies by deconjugating poly-SUMO-modified proteins, which affects the number and size of these nuclear bodies (Kunz2018SUMOspecific). It is involved in the regulation of SUMO-2/-3 conjugates, which is important for processes such as nuclear transport, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation (Shen2009Characterization). SENP7's activity is crucial for preventing excessive SUMOylation, which can impede protein degradation and affect cellular health (Claessens2024SUMO).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SENP7 gene have been linked to a severe multisystemic syndrome characterized by arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, early respiratory failure, and neutropenia. This condition is associated with a homozygous stop-gain variant in SENP7, leading to a truncated protein that lacks the catalytic domain. The resulting loss of SENP7 function causes decreased mRNA levels due to nonsense-mediated decay, reduced heterochromatin condensation, and aberrant gene expression. Patients with this mutation exhibit severe clinical manifestations, including congenital arthrogryposis, early respiratory failure, and recurrent infections, often resulting in death within four months after birth (Samra2023Exome).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SENP7 expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissue. Overexpression of SENP7 in GBM cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This indicates that alterations in SENP7 expression may contribute to tumor invasiveness and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for GBM (Zhang2024SENP7).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), SENP7 transcript levels are suppressed, contributing to a hyperSUMOylation phenotype in MYC-driven lymphomas. This suppression is linked to various genetic lesions, suggesting a role for SENP7 in maintaining genomic stability (Schick2022Genetic).

## Interactions
SENP7 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in modulating their functions through deSUMOylation. It specifically interacts with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor, and enhances its activation by reversing the inhibitory effects of SUMOylation. This interaction is crucial for the production of type-I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are essential for the host defense against infections (Cui2017SENP7). SENP7 also associates with PTEN in CD8+ T cells, facilitating its degradation through deSUMOylation. This interaction is vital for sustaining the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for the metabolic fitness and antitumor functions of CD8+ T cells (Wu2022SENP7).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SENP7 affects the SUMO2/3 target proteins AKT, HIF-1α, and MMP9, which are related to tumor proliferation and metastasis. Overexpression of SENP7 leads to reduced levels of these proteins, suggesting its role in inhibiting tumor invasion (Zhang2024SENP7). These interactions highlight SENP7's role in regulating protein function and cellular processes through its deSUMOylation activity.
