# CIBAR1

## Overview
CIBAR1, or CBY1 interacting BAR domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. The protein encoded by CIBAR1 is characterized by its interaction with CBY1, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This interaction suggests that the CIBAR1 protein may play a role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby influencing cell shape and movement. The protein's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular integrity and function. Alterations in the expression of CIBAR1 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including prostate cancer and pancreatic diseases, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Cyge2021Loss; Kobelyatskaya2023Transcriptome).

## Function
CIBAR1, also known as CBY1 interacting BAR domain containing 1, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with CBY1, a key player in the Wnt signaling pathways. These pathways are essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, which are critical processes in maintaining healthy cellular function and architecture. By influencing Wnt signaling, CIBAR1 contributes to the proper execution of these cellular activities, ensuring that cells respond appropriately to various developmental and environmental cues. The interaction between CIBAR1 and CBY1 suggests a collaborative role in modulating the dynamics of the cytoskeleton, which is vital for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell movement. Through these functions, CIBAR1 supports the structural integrity and functional capacity of cells, which are necessary for the overall health and development of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
CIBAR1, also known as CBY1 interacting BAR domain containing 1, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In prostate cancer, particularly within the TMPRSS2-ERG molecular subtype, CIBAR1 is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is associated with the progression from localized to advanced prostate cancer, as indicated by a negative correlation in expression levels (Kobelyatskaya2023Transcriptome). Despite its differential expression, the specific clinical significance of CIBAR1 in prostate cancer remains unclear, as it does not show a strong predictive value compared to other genes (Kobelyatskaya2023Transcriptome).

In the context of pancreatic health, CIBAR1 interacts with the ciliary protein Chibby1 (Cby1) to facilitate ciliogenesis. Loss of Cby1 in mice leads to pancreatic degeneration and pancreatitis, suggesting that disruptions in CIBAR1 interactions could contribute to similar conditions. However, the direct clinical implications of CIBAR1 in pancreatic diseases are not explicitly detailed (Cyge2021Loss). Further research is needed to fully understand the role of CIBAR1 in these and other potential conditions.
