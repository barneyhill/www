# SH3PXD2A

## Overview
The SH3PXD2A gene encodes the Tks5 protein, a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in cellular processes such as migration and matrix degradation. Tks5 is characterized by its structural domains, including a phox homology (PX) domain and multiple Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate its function in the formation of actin-rich structures known as podosomes and invadopodia. These structures are essential for cellular invasion and migration, particularly in cancer cells, where they contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix. The protein's interactions with various signaling molecules and its involvement in reactive oxygen species production underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and pathology. Mutations in SH3PXD2A have been linked to developmental disorders such as non-syndromic cleft lip and palate, as well as cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Díaz2023A; CejudoMartin2014Genetic; Li2017SH3PXD2A).

## Structure
The SH3PXD2A gene encodes the Tks5 protein, which is a scaffold protein involved in cell migration and matrix degradation. Tks5 contains a phox homology (PX) domain at the N-terminus and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains at the C-terminus, interspersed with several polyproline motifs and two main Src phosphorylation sites (Y557 and Y619) (CejudoMartin2014Genetic; Li2017SH3PXD2A). The PX domain is a globular fold approximately 110 residues in length, composed of three β-strands followed by three α-helices, and it shows specificity for phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), primarily found on early endosomal membranes (Teasdale2011Insights). The SH3 domains facilitate protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs (Kazemein2024Functional).

Tks5 is essential for the formation of podosomes and invadopodia, which are actin-rich structures involved in cellular invasion and migration (Li2017SH3PXD2A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function and interactions (Teasdale2011Insights). Multiple splice variants of Tks5 exist, including a novel isoform, Tks5b, which lacks the PX domain and has a unique amino terminal sequence (CejudoMartin2014Genetic). These isoforms may have distinct roles in cellular functions and are regulated through alternative transcription and splicing (CejudoMartin2014Genetic).

## Function
The SH3PXD2A gene encodes the TKS5 protein, a scaffolding protein essential for the formation of podosomes in untransformed cells and invadopodia in cancer cells. These structures, collectively known as invadosomes, are actin-rich cellular protrusions that secrete proteolytic enzymes to degrade the extracellular matrix, thereby regulating cellular migration, invasion, adhesion, and the release of growth factors (Li2017SH3PXD2A). In healthy human cells, TKS5-dependent podosomes are important for mediating cell migration during embryogenesis. For instance, knockdown of TKS5 in zebrafish results in impaired dorsal-ventral migration of neural crest cells and defective craniofacial structures and pigmentation (Li2017SH3PXD2A).

The full-length TKS5 protein contains a PX domain and five SH3 domains, which are crucial for its function in invadosome formation. The PX domain is necessary for binding to the cell membrane, allowing TKS5 to localize to invadosome foci. TKS5 interacts with various proteins, including adaptor proteins and actin regulatory proteins, to mediate invadosome formation and maturation. It also interacts with components of the NADPH oxidase complex to promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which facilitates invadosome formation (Li2017SH3PXD2A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SH3PXD2A gene, which encodes the TKS5 protein, have been implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions. In the context of craniofacial development, SH3PXD2A is associated with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P). A genome-wide association study identified SH3PXD2A as a candidate gene for nsCL/P, highlighting its role in neural crest cell migration, which is crucial for craniofacial development (van2019NonSyndromic). Disruption of SH3PXD2A in mice results in cleft palate and neonatal death, underscoring its essential role in palatogenesis (CejudoMartin2014Genetic).

In cancer, SH3PXD2A is involved in cell migration and invasion through its role in invadopodia formation. Alterations in its expression have been linked to reduced cancer cell invasion and tumor progression. In gliomas, SH3PXD2A is overexpressed and associated with poor patient survival, suggesting that targeting its pathways could be a therapeutic strategy (Díaz2023A). The gene's involvement in invadopodia formation also implicates it in cancer metastasis, as it interacts with metalloproteinases and proteins involved in actin assembly (Mao2024Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SH3PXD2A in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
The SH3PXD2A gene encodes the TKS5 protein, which is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for invadosome formation and function. TKS5 contains a Phox-homology (PX) domain and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. The PX domain is crucial for membrane localization, while the SH3 domains mediate protein-protein interactions (Li2017SH3PXD2A).

TKS5 interacts with several proteins involved in actin regulation, including NCK1, NCK2, GRB2, CTTN (Cortactin), WASL (N-WASP), and the ACTR2/ACTR3 (Arp2/3) complex. These interactions are important for actin polymerization and invadosome assembly (Li2017SH3PXD2A). TKS5 also associates with Src family kinases, which are crucial for podosome biology (CejudoMartin2014Genetic).

In addition, TKS5 interacts with NOXA1 and CYBA (p22phox) to promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, a process important for invadosome formation (Li2017SH3PXD2A). It also binds to ADAM family metalloproteases, such as ADAM12, ADAM15, and ADAM19, through PxxP motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of ADAMs and the fifth SH3 domain of TKS5. These interactions are significant for processing growth factors and regulating cell motility (Mao2024Genetic).
