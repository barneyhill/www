# PAQR9

## Overview
PAQR9 is a gene that encodes the protein progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 9, which is part of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a receptor involved in protein quality control and metabolic regulation. It plays a crucial role in modulating the stability and degradation of specific proteins, such as mislocalized membrane proteins and the transcription factor PPARα, through interactions with other proteins like BAG6 and HUWE1. These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating metabolic pathways, particularly during fasting. PAQR9's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as liver cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Lin2021PAQR9; You2020PAQR9; AbouFadel2023Key).

## Function
PAQR9, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, plays a significant role in protein quality control and metabolic regulation in human cells. It is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it interacts with BAG6, a key component in the post-translational protein quality control machinery. This interaction modulates the degradation and polyubiquitination of mislocalized membrane proteins (MLPs), such as human TCRα, APP-C99, and mouse rhodopsin (OP90), by reducing their binding to BAG6, thereby stabilizing these proteins (You2020PAQR9).

In the liver, PAQR9 is involved in regulating hepatic ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation during fasting by modulating the protein stability of PPARα, a critical transcription factor in these metabolic processes. PAQR9 inhibits the degradation of PPARα by competing with HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus preventing PPARα's polyubiquitination and degradation. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining PPARα protein levels, which in turn influences metabolic pathways during fasting (Lin2021PAQR9).

## Clinical Significance
PAQR9 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PAQR9 is upregulated and associated with significantly worse prognostic outcomes. This suggests that increased expression of PAQR9 may contribute to the development and progression of HCC, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for the disease (AbouFadel2023Key). In contrast, PAQR9 is downregulated in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) primary tumors, indicating its differential role in liver cancer subtypes (AbouFadel2023Key).

PAQR9 is also involved in the regulation of protein quality control through its interaction with BAG6, a protein responsible for the triage of mislocalized membrane proteins (MLPs). Alterations in PAQR9 expression can affect the degradation and ubiquitination of MLPs, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Knockdown of PAQR9 accelerates the degradation of certain membrane proteins, suggesting that PAQR9 plays a role in inhibiting their degradation and suppressing polyubiquitination (You2020PAQR9). These findings highlight the importance of PAQR9 in cellular processes that, when disrupted, may contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, specific diseases directly linked to PAQR9 mutations or expression changes remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
PAQR9, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. PAQR9 interacts with PPARα, a key transcription factor involved in ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, by modulating its stability. Although PAQR9 does not directly bind to PPARα, it affects PPARα's poly-ubiquitination and degradation by competing with HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for PPARα degradation. This competitive inhibition protects PPARα from degradation, thereby stabilizing its protein levels and influencing metabolic processes during fasting (Lin2021PAQR9).

PAQR9 also interacts with BAG6, a protein involved in the quality control of mislocalized membrane proteins (MLPs). This interaction affects the degradation rates of specific membrane proteins by inhibiting their polyubiquitination. PAQR9 binds to the DUF3538 domain of BAG6, reducing the interaction of BAG6 with MLPs and RNF126, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby modulating the degradation and ubiquitination processes of these proteins (You2020PAQR9). These interactions highlight PAQR9's role in regulating protein stability and degradation pathways, impacting various cellular functions.
