# PFKM

## Overview
The PFKM gene encodes the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a critical enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that functions as a kinase. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a key regulatory step in glycolysis that commits glucose to energy production (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase; Mor2011Control). PFKM is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it forms homotetramers and plays a vital role in energy metabolism, particularly during muscle contraction and exercise (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase; Rani2020In). The enzyme's activity is finely regulated by various metabolites, ensuring efficient glucose metabolism and energy production (Mor2011Control). Mutations in the PFKM gene can lead to glycogen storage disease type VII (GSDVII), also known as Tarui's disease, which is characterized by exercise intolerance and muscle cramps (Raben1995Mutations; García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase). Additionally, alterations in PFKM expression have been linked to cancer, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression (Ishfaq2022Expression; Rani2020In).

## Function
The PFKM gene encodes the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a critical step that commits glucose to glycolysis, thereby facilitating energy production in the form of ATP (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase; Mor2011Control). PFKM is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it forms homotetramers and plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly during muscle contraction and exercise (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase; Rani2020In).

In healthy cells, PFKM activity is tightly regulated by various metabolites. It is activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP, and inhibited by ATP, citrate, and long-chain fatty acids, allowing cells to adjust glycolytic flux according to their energy needs (Mor2011Control). This regulation ensures efficient glucose metabolism and energy production, which is vital for maintaining muscle function and overall cellular energy homeostasis (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase).

PFKM also plays a role in erythrocytes, where it forms heterotetramers with the liver isoform PFKL, contributing to the regulation of glycolysis in red blood cells (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PFKM gene, which encodes the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase, lead to glycogen storage disease type VII (GSDVII), also known as Tarui's disease. This condition is characterized by exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and myoglobinuria due to impaired glycolysis and subsequent glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle (Raben1995Mutations; García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase). Clinical manifestations of GSDVII vary widely, ranging from severe infantile forms that can lead to early death to milder forms presenting primarily with exercise intolerance (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase).

PFKM deficiency also affects erythrocyte metabolism, leading to partial enzyme deficiency and hemolysis, which contributes to the systemic nature of the disorder (García2009Phosphofructo1Kinase). In some cases, mutations in PFKM can result in a hemolytic form of the disease without significant muscle symptoms (Nakajima2002Phosphofructokinase).

Alterations in PFKM expression have been implicated in cancer, particularly in the context of the Warburg effect, where cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis. Overexpression of PFKM has been observed in breast cancer, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Ishfaq2022Expression; Rani2020In). Genetic variations in PFKM, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, may influence cancer susceptibility and progression by affecting cell metabolism (Rani2020In).

## Interactions
PFKM (phosphofructokinase, muscle) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of mouse testis and sperm. It interacts with hexokinase type 1 (HK1S), a testis-specific isozyme, in the principal piece region of the sperm flagellum. This interaction is crucial for anchoring glycolytic enzymes to the fibrous sheath of the sperm, which is essential for sperm motility and energy production (Nakamura2010Molecular).

PFKM also forms a molecular complex with glutathione S-transferase mu class 5 (GSTM5) in the sperm fibrous sheath. This interaction is mediated by the testis-specific region (TSR) of PFKM, which plays a significant role in the structural organization and function of the sperm flagellum (Nakamura2010Molecular). The interaction with GSTM5 is confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens, pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation assays (Nakamura2010Molecular).

In addition to these interactions, PFKM is involved in a complex with other testis-specific isozymes, contributing to the unique metabolic requirements of spermatogenic cells. These interactions highlight the specialized roles of PFKM in testis-specific functions and its importance in glycolytic processes within the sperm (Nakamura2010Molecular).
