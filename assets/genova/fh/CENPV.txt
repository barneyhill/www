# CENPV

## Overview
CENPV, or centromere protein V, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in chromosome segregation during cell division. The CENPV protein is a key component of the centromere, contributing to the formation and function of the kinetochore, a critical structure for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. As a microtubule-associated protein, CENPV is involved in stabilizing microtubule structures and is essential for maintaining spindle integrity during mitosis and meiosis (Grau2017Xp11.22; Nabi2021CENPV). Additionally, CENPV is associated with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), influencing processes such as cytokinesis and ciliary function (Zhang2022Integrated). Its interactions with other proteins, such as those in the spindle assembly checkpoint, underscore its importance in ensuring genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Garcia2020Dissection).

## Function
CENPV, or centromere protein V, is a crucial component in the assembly and function of the centromere, playing a significant role in chromosome segregation during cell division. It is involved in the formation of the kinetochore, a structure essential for proper chromosome alignment during metaphase and segregation during anaphase, thereby ensuring genomic stability and successful cytokinesis (Grau2017Xp11.22). CENPV is active in the nucleus, particularly at the centromere, where it contributes to cell cycle progression by linking microtubules and Src family kinases, which are important for directional cell motility (Grau2017Xp11.22).

In addition to its role in cell division, CENPV is associated with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is involved in the primary contraction of mitotic chromosomes and peristomal heterochromatin. Depletion of CENPV results in a strong CPC phenotype, characterized by difficulties in chromosome bi-orientation and failure to complete cytokinesis, leading to apoptotic cell death (Zhang2022Integrated). CENPV also localizes to primary cilia during interphase, where it regulates cilia levels of acetylated microtubulin (αtubulin), indicating its involvement in ciliary function (Zhang2022Integrated).

## Clinical Significance
CENPV (centromere protein V) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in chromosome segregation and cell division. Alterations in CENPV expression have been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where it is identified as a core biomarker with significant predictive performance. The gene's expression is negatively correlated with resting memory CD4 T cells, suggesting a role in the immune microenvironment and disease progression (Zhang2022Integrated).

In cancer, CENPV is overexpressed in basal cell carcinomas and adnexa, indicating a potential role in cell division and cancer development (Zhang2022Integrated). It is also considered a prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where its methylation status is linked to patient survival outcomes (Zhu2019Construction). In breast cancer, CENPV expression varies between subtypes, being suppressed in [ER-|PR-]HER2+ tumors and elevated in [ER-|PR-]HER2- tumors, which may influence tumor aggressiveness and progression (Li2016Exploring).

These findings suggest that CENPV could serve as a biomarker for various diseases, providing insights into their pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
CENPV, also known as centromere protein V, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that are essential for its function in chromosome segregation. CENPV is known to associate with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) component MAD2L1, which plays a role in directing the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) subunits Aurora B and INCENP to the kinetochore. This interaction is crucial for proper cytokinesis and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Garcia2020Dissection).

In mouse oocytes, CENPV interacts with spindle microtubules, where it functions as a microtubule bundling protein. This interaction is vital for maintaining spindle integrity and proper chromosome alignment during meiosis. The absence of CENPV leads to impaired spindle integrity and increased aneuploidy, highlighting its role in stabilizing microtubule structures (Nabi2021CENPV).

CENPV also supports tubulin acetylation at basal bodies and axonemes of primary cilia, enhancing microtubule resilience to mechanical stress. This suggests a role in promoting cell migration by targeting Src family kinases to the microtubule network (Nabi2021CENPV). These interactions underscore the importance of CENPV in maintaining chromosomal integrity and proper cell division.
