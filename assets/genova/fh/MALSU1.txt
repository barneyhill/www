# MALSU1

## Overview
MALSU1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial assembly of ribosomal large subunit 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU), functioning as part of a complex that prevents premature association with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mtSSU), thereby regulating the formation of the 55S monosome (Chowdhury2023Autism; Hilander2021The). The MALSU1 protein is characterized by a globular domain and interacts with various ribosomal proteins and RNA elements, facilitating essential conformational changes and interactions within the mitoribosome (Brown2017Structures). Its involvement extends to mitoribosome quality control and cellular stress response regulation, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Ronayne2023Tetracyclinedependent).

## Structure
The MALSU1 protein is involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit. Its structure includes a well-defined globular domain, with an atomic model built for residues 91-201. This domain features a 5-stranded β-sheet that packs perpendicularly against the terminal helix of the uL14m protein, facilitating interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome (Brown2017Structures). The N-terminus of MALSU1 likely forms a cleavable mitochondria-targeting peptide, while the C-terminal residues are flexible and averaged out of structural reconstructions (Brown2017Structures).

MALSU1 is part of a complex with L0R8F8 and mt-ACP, which plays a role in preventing premature subunit association by sterically obstructing the binding of the mitochondrial small subunit (mt-SSU) (Brown2017Structures). This complex is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the mitoribosome during assembly. The MALSU1 protein also interacts with the sarcin-ricin stem-loop (SRL) of mt-LSU rRNA, which may help position this helix before the folding of the interfacial mt-rRNA (Brown2017Structures). The protein's interactions and structural features are essential for its function in mitoribosomal biogenesis and stability.

## Function
MALSU1 is a protein localized on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a critical role in the assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) (Hilander2021The). It interacts with ribosomal proteins such as uL14m and bL19m, inducing conformational changes essential for the assembly of the functional mtLSU core and the GTP-catalyzed steps of translation (Hilander2021The). MALSU1 is part of an anti-association module that prevents premature association of the mtLSU with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mtSSU), thus regulating the formation of the 55S monosome (Chowdhury2023Autism).

MALSU1 is also involved in mitoribosome quality control, particularly during elongational stalling, which is crucial for cell survival under nutrient stress conditions (Ronayne2023Tetracyclinedependent). It stabilizes the large mitoribosome subunit, facilitating the rescue of cells from death (Ronayne2023Tetracyclinedependent). The protein's role extends to the regulation of ER stress responses, where it is necessary for the modulation of IRE1α-mediated unfolded protein response activity, linking mitochondrial function with cellular stress responses (Ronayne2023Tetracyclinedependent). These functions highlight MALSU1's importance in maintaining mitochondrial health and overall cellular metabolism.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MALSU1 is involved in several interactions critical for mitoribosome assembly and function. It forms a complex with MIEF1 and mt-ACP, which causes steric hindrance on subunit joining, preventing the formation of the 55S monosome. This complex is one of the last to disassemble from the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) before subunit joining (Hilander2021The). MALSU1 interacts with the ribosomal protein uL14m, causing conformational changes to another ribosomal protein, bL19m, which is subsequently bound by GTPBP7. It also induces a conformational change in the sarcin-ricin-loop (SRL) region of the 16S rRNA, essential for the assembly of the functional mtLSU core (Hilander2021The).

MALSU1 is part of a heterotrimer with L0R8F8 and mt-ACP, interacting with the SRL, uL14m, and bL19m, and remains bound through multiple steps of mtLSU maturation (Nguyen2023Structural). It also interacts with GTPBP10, aiding in the positioning of the catalytic walker B motif in GTPBP10's GTPase domain, which is crucial for mitoribosome biogenesis (Nguyen2023Structural). MALSU1's interaction with the NORAD RNA, specifically the NRU78 domain, has also been identified, suggesting a role in RNA-protein interactions (Kumar2023Discovery).
