# TAMM41

## Overview
TAMM41 is a gene that encodes the TAM41 mitochondrial translocator assembly and maintenance homolog, a protein integral to mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial CDP-DAG synthase, playing a pivotal role in lipid biosynthesis, particularly in the production of cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for mitochondrial membrane integrity and function. The TAMM41 protein is a peripheral membrane protein located on the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid and cytidine triphosphate into CDP-diacylglycerol, a precursor for cardiolipin synthesis (Jiao2019Structures). This enzymatic activity is crucial for the assembly and stability of mitochondrial inner membrane complexes, including the TIM23 translocator complex, which is important for mitochondrial protein import (Kutik2008The). The gene's function is also linked to maintaining the integrity and activity of the respiratory chain supercomplexes, which are vital for cellular energy production (Kutik2008The). Mutations in TAMM41 have been associated with congenital heart diseases and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial health and function (Zhang2021Association; Yang2019TAMM41).

## Structure
The TAMM41 protein, also known as Tam41 in yeast, is a mitochondrial CDP-DAG synthase involved in lipid biosynthesis. The primary structure of TAMM41 consists of 393 amino acids, including a short mitochondrial presequence that is cleaved upon import into the mitochondria (Jiao2019Structures). The protein features an NTase domain and a winged helix domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic function. The NTase domain, spanning residues 28-189, exhibits an abababa topology, while the winged helix domain covers residues 190-319 (Jiao2019Structures).

The tertiary structure of TAMM41 reveals that the NTase and winged helix domains form an 'L'-shaped CTP-binding pocket, with a hydrophobic arm and a polar arm, facilitating the binding of CTP necessary for its catalytic activity (Jiao2019Structures). The C-terminal region of TAMM41 contains amphipathic helices that are essential for membrane association, interacting with the mitochondrial inner membrane (Jiao2019Structures).

In terms of quaternary structure, the SpTam41-CD74 construct, a variant of TAMM41, forms a stable dimeric state in solution, although the full-length protein is primarily monomeric, suggesting that the C-terminal region may inhibit dimerization (Jiao2019Structures).

## Function
The TAMM41 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function. TAMM41 is a peripheral membrane protein located on the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP) into CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), a precursor for cardiolipin synthesis (Jiao2019Structures). This process is crucial for the production of anionic phospholipids, which are vital components of cellular membranes and are involved in various mitochondrial processes such as cristae formation and oxidative phosphorylation (Jiao2019Structures).

TAMM41's activity is essential for the assembly and stability of mitochondrial inner membrane complexes, including the TIM23 translocator complex, which is important for mitochondrial protein import (Jiao2019Structures; Kutik2008The). The protein's function in cardiolipin biosynthesis is also linked to maintaining the integrity and activity of the respiratory chain supercomplexes, which are crucial for energy production in cells (Kutik2008The). In mammals, the absence of TAMM41 leads to decreased levels of mitochondrial CDP-DAG and cardiolipin, affecting mitochondrial function and reducing oxygen consumption (Jiao2019Structures).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAMM41 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly congenital heart diseases (CHD). Pathogenic intronic variants of TAMM41 have been identified in patients with atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), a type of CHD. These variants can lead to abnormal splicing and reduced expression of normal TAMM41 transcripts, contributing to the development of heart valve abnormalities (Yang2019TAMM41). The gene is crucial for heart valve differentiation through its role in the PINK1-PARK2 dependent mitophagy pathway, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality control during heart development (Wang2023The; Yang2019TAMM41).

In addition to its role in heart development, alterations in TAMM41 expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower expression levels of TAMM41 have been observed in AD patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the disease (Zhang2021Association). The involvement of TAMM41 in mitophagy, a process crucial for the removal of damaged mitochondria, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular health and its potential impact on diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction (Ajoolabady2020Mitophagy).

## Interactions
TAMM41, a mitochondrial protein, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function. It plays a significant role in the PINK1-PARK2 dependent mitophagy pathway, which is essential for heart valve differentiation. TAMM41 interacts directly with PINK1, a key protein in this pathway, facilitating PINK1 stabilization and PARK2 translocation to damaged mitochondria. This interaction enhances PARK2 recruitment, which is vital for the mitophagy process (Yang2019TAMM41).

TAMM41 is also involved in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, a critical phospholipid for mitochondrial membrane integrity. It interacts with phosphatidic acid (PA) through electrostatic interactions, where the negatively charged head group of PA is attracted to the positively charged residues in the active site of TAMM41. This interaction is crucial for the synthesis of CDP-DAG, a precursor in cardiolipin biosynthesis (Jiao2019Structures).

In yeast, the homolog of TAMM41, known as Tam41, is essential for maintaining the integrity of the TIM23 protein translocator complex in mitochondria. It is involved in the import of presequence-containing proteins, indicating its role in protein import pathways (Tamura2006Identification).
