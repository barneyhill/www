# HMGB2

## Overview
HMGB2 is a gene that encodes the high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) protein, a non-histone chromatin-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. As a member of the high mobility group box (HMGB) family, HMGB2 is characterized by its two DNA-binding domains, known as HMG boxes, which facilitate its function as a DNA chaperone. The HMGB2 protein is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it interacts with nucleosomes, DNA, and transcription factors to modulate gene expression and chromatin structure (Bagherpoor2017Properties; Kučírek2019HMGB2). It is involved in critical biological processes such as telomerase regulation, cell differentiation, and proliferation, and is expressed during embryogenesis and in specific adult tissues like lymphoid organs and testes (Bagherpoor2017Properties; Kučírek2019HMGB2). The protein's interactions with various signaling pathways and transcription factors underscore its role as an architectural protein, influencing gene expression and cellular function (Taniguchi2009Chromatin; Boonyaratanakornkit1998HighMobility).

## Structure
The HMGB2 protein is composed of two homologous DNA-binding domains known as HMG boxes A and B, connected by a short, intrinsically disordered interdomain linker (Uewaki2013Preferential). Each HMG box consists of approximately 75 amino acids and adopts an L-shaped fold made up of three α-helices (Štros2010HMGB). The long arm of the L-shape includes the extended N-terminal strand and helix III, while the short arm consists of helices I and II (Štros2010HMGB).

The interdomain linker, rich in proline, glycine, and lysine, is unstructured and plays a crucial role in the spatial arrangement of the HMG boxes through weak intramolecular interactions, particularly involving the residue Y78 (Uewaki2013Preferential). These interactions are mediated by CH-π interactions, which are non-bonded interactions comparable to hydrogen bonds (Uewaki2013Preferential).

The HMGB2 protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which influence its function and interactions with DNA and chromatin (Štros2010HMGB). The protein's structure in solution has been studied using NMR and SAXS, revealing that the HMG boxes assume a preferred orientation with their DNA-binding surfaces facing opposite directions (Uewaki2013Preferential).

## Function
HMGB2 is a member of the high mobility group box (HMGB) family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, HMGB2 plays a crucial role in modulating gene transcription by interacting with nucleosomes, DNA, and transcription factors. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it serves as a DNA chaperone, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Bagherpoor2017Properties; Kučírek2019HMGB2).

HMGB2 acts as a negative regulator of telomerase activity in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and neuroectodermal cells (hNECs). Its deficiency leads to increased telomerase activity, potentially through the activation of signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, which influences cell growth and survival (Kučírek2019HMGB2). HMGB2 also interacts with telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), enhancing its inhibitory effect on telomerase activity (Kučírek2019HMGB2).

In addition to its role in telomerase regulation, HMGB2 is involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. It is expressed during embryogenesis and plays roles in differentiation programs such as erythropoiesis, chondrogenesis, and neurogenesis (Kučírek2019HMGB2). HMGB2 is predominantly expressed in lymphoid organs and testes in adult tissues (Bagherpoor2017Properties).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMGB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), HMGB2 is associated with increased proliferation, invasion, and poor prognosis. Elevated HMGB2 expression in LUAD tissues correlates with shorter disease-free survival and relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic marker (Qiu2022Identification). In diffuse astrocytomas, particularly in grades 2 and 3, high HMGB2 expression is linked to worse overall survival. The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation, with hypermethylation associated with reduced expression and better survival outcomes (Becker2024Proteomic). 

In pancreatic cancer, HMGB2 is involved in maintaining the Warburg effect, a metabolic reprogramming process, and its high expression predicts poor prognosis. Silencing HMGB2 inhibits cell proliferation and decreases levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, which is involved in glycolysis (Cai2017Expression). 

HMGB2 also plays a role in gastric cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in DNA replication and repair, contributing to cancer hallmarks such as uncontrolled replication and metastasis (Fang2019Bioinformatics). 

In the context of immunological conditions, elevated expression of hsa-miR-590-3p down-regulates HMGB2, contributing to the severity of Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) (Zhai2019Elevated).

## Interactions
HMGB2 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it enhances the DNA binding of the transcription factor Lef-1. This interaction is crucial for potentiating the transcriptional activation of the Lef-1-β-catenin complex, particularly in chondrogenic cell types (Taniguchi2009Chromatin). HMGB2 does not directly bind to β-catenin but forms a complex with Lef-1 and β-catenin, enhancing the expression of genes with Lef-1 binding sites (Taniguchi2009Chromatin).

HMGB2 also interacts with steroid hormone receptors, such as the progesterone receptor (PR), enhancing their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. This interaction is specific to steroid receptors and does not extend to nonsteroid nuclear receptors like the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Boonyaratanakornkit1998HighMobility). Additionally, HMGB2 can bind to telomeric DNA structures and is involved in telomere maintenance, interacting with proteins like TRF1 (Kučírek2019HMGB2).

These interactions highlight HMGB2's role as an architectural protein, facilitating the binding of transcription factors to DNA and influencing gene expression through various signaling pathways.
