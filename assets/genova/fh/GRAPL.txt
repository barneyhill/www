# GRAPL

## Overview
The GRAPL gene encodes the GRB2 related adaptor protein like, also known as GrpL, which is a member of the Grb family of adaptor proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an NH2-terminal SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a proline-rich region, and a COOH-terminal SH3 domain, which facilitate its role in T cell signaling. GRAPL is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues, with significant expression in the thymus, indicating its involvement in early T cell development. The protein interacts with key signaling molecules such as SLP-76 and LAT, playing a crucial role in the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. These interactions underscore GRAPL's importance in modulating immune responses and T cell activation (Law1999GrpL; Ma2001Leukocytespecific).

## Structure


## Function
The GRAPL protein, also known as GrpL, is a member of the Grb family of adaptor proteins and plays a significant role in T cell signaling. It is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an NH2-terminal SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a proline-rich region, and a COOH-terminal SH3 domain. This structure allows GRAPL to interact with specific proteins in lymphocytes, particularly through its proline-rich motifs that may bind SH3-containing proteins (Law1999GrpL).

In healthy human cells, GRAPL is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues, with the highest levels found in the thymus, indicating its involvement in early T cell development. It interacts with SLP-76, a critical adaptor in T cell receptor signaling, in a phosphorylation-independent manner. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), which is essential for T cell activation and function (Law1999GrpL).

GRAPL's role in T cell signaling suggests it may influence immune responses by modulating NF-AT activation. Its specific interactions and expression pattern highlight its importance in the regulation of T cell activation and development (Law1999GrpL).

## Interactions
Grap2, also known as GRAPL, is a leukocyte-specific adaptor protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for T cell signaling. It interacts with hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) through its carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain, binding to the second proline-rich motif of HPK1. This interaction enhances HPK1's kinase activity and contributes to the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, which is important for T cell activation and development (Ma2001Leukocytespecific).

Grap2 also interacts with SLP-76 and LAT, both of which are involved in the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). These interactions suggest that Grap2 plays a role in coupling the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 with protein tyrosine kinases, facilitating signal transduction during T cell activation (Ma2001Leukocytespecific).

The interaction between Grap2 and HPK1 is specific, as demonstrated by the inability of deletion mutants lacking certain domains to activate the JNK pathway. This specificity highlights the importance of Grap2's domains in mediating its interactions and subsequent signaling effects (Ma2001Leukocytespecific).
