# LDLRAD2

## Overview
LDLRAD2 is a gene that encodes the protein low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLRA) domain, which suggests its role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and cellular signaling pathways. LDLRAD2 has been identified as a significant player in the progression of certain cancers, particularly pancreatic cancer, where it functions as an oncogene. The protein's involvement in the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway underscores its importance in regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2021LDLRAD2).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
LDLRAD2 has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer (PC). Studies have shown that LDLRAD2 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines compared to normal pancreatic tissues, and this up-regulation is associated with a poor prognosis in PC patients (Li2021LDLRAD2). Functional assays indicate that knockdown of LDLRAD2 impairs pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, both in vitro and in vivo (Li2021LDLRAD2). In vivo experiments using a mouse xenograft model demonstrate that silencing LDLRAD2 significantly retards tumor growth and reduces the number of metastatic tumors (Li2021LDLRAD2).

Mechanistically, LDLRAD2 promotes pancreatic cancer progression through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. Silencing LDLRAD2 downregulates this pathway, suppressing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Warburg effect, both of which are processes associated with cancer progression (Li2021LDLRAD2). These findings suggest that LDLRAD2 acts as an oncogene in pancreatic cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in this disease (Li2021LDLRAD2).
