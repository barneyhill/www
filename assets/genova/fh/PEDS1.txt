# PEDS1

## Overview
PEDS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme plasmanylethanolamine desaturase 1, a transmembrane protein integral to the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, which are a type of ether phospholipid. These lipids are crucial components of cell membranes, particularly in the brain and heart, and play significant roles in cellular signaling and protection against oxidative stress. The PEDS1 protein is characterized by a conserved motif of histidines that coordinate a di-metal center essential for its enzymatic activity, which involves the introduction of a vinyl ether double bond into plasmanylethanolamine. This process is vital for the conversion into plasmenylethanolamine, a key step in plasmalogen formation. The enzyme's activity is dependent on oxygen and cytochrome b5, highlighting its role in aerobic pathways. Mutations or altered expression of the PEDS1 gene can lead to deficiencies in plasmalogen biosynthesis, which are associated with various human pathologies, including inflammatory disorders and increased susceptibility to infections (Werner2020The; Arroyo2024Peds1; Koch2022Tricky).

## Structure
The PEDS1 protein, encoded by the TMEM189 gene, is integral to the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, a type of ether lipid. The molecular structure of PEDS1 includes a conserved motif with eight histidines, which are crucial for its enzymatic function, similar to plant fatty acid desaturases (Werner2020The). These histidines are essential for coordinating the di-metal center necessary for catalysis (Werner2020The). The protein is predicted to have a four transmembrane helix topology, with a spatial arrangement of nine histidines, an aspartate, and a phenylalanine, which are critical for its activity (Padmanabhan2022Plasmalogens).

The tertiary structure of PEDS1 features extensive alpha helices extending from the catalytic center, identified by conserved histidine residues and cation-binding sites (Werner2022Essential). Aspartate 100 and phenylalanine 118 are particularly important, as they stabilize the iron ion at the catalytic site (Werner2022Essential). The protein is modeled as a monomer, although experimental data suggest it may form dimers or oligomers (Werner2022Essential). The structure has been validated using AlphaFold2, which confirmed the predicted model with high structural similarity (Werner2022Essential).

## Function
PEDS1, also known as plasmanylethanolamine desaturase 1, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, a type of ether phospholipid integral to cell membranes, particularly in the brain and heart. The enzyme is responsible for introducing a vinyl ether double bond into plasmanylethanolamine, converting it into plasmenylethanolamine, a key step in plasmalogen formation (Werner2020The; Dorninger2022Regulation). This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, following initial steps in the peroxisomes (Padmanabhan2022Plasmalogens).

PEDS1 is a transmembrane protein that contains a conserved motif of eight histidines essential for its enzymatic activity. These histidines are crucial for coordinating the enzyme's di-metal center, which is necessary for its function (Werner2022Essential). The enzyme's activity is oxygen and cytochrome b5-dependent, highlighting its role in aerobic pathways of plasmalogen biosynthesis (Koch2022Tricky).

Plasmalogens, the products of PEDS1 activity, are important for maintaining membrane integrity and function. They act as antioxidants and are involved in cellular signaling, contributing to the protection of cells against oxidative stress and playing a role in processes like ferroptosis (Koch2022Tricky). The proper functioning of PEDS1 is essential for maintaining the balance of lipid species in healthy cells, which is crucial for normal physiological functions (Koch2020Unequivocal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the PEDS1 gene, which encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase 1, have been implicated in various diseases due to their impact on plasmalogen biosynthesis. Plasmalogens are critical components of cellular membranes, and their deficiency is associated with several human pathologies. In zebrafish models, PEDS1 deficiency leads to increased inflammation, myeloid cell apoptosis, and impaired inflammation resolution, suggesting a potential link to inflammatory disorders in humans (Arroyo2024Peds1). 

The deficiency of PEDS1 also results in increased susceptibility to infections, as seen in zebrafish with heightened vulnerability to Salmonella enterica serovar Thyphimurium, which can be partially mitigated by exogenous plasmalogen supplementation (Arroyo2024Peds1). This suggests that PEDS1 mutations could contribute to immune system deficiencies and increased infection risk. 

In humans, alterations in PEDS1 expression may be linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where plasmalogen levels are known to decline (Werner2020The). The enzyme's role in maintaining plasmalogen levels underscores its potential clinical significance in conditions related to lipid dysregulation and inflammation.
