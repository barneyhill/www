# PAPLN

## Overview
PAPLN is a gene that encodes the protein papilin, a proteoglycan-like sulfated glycoprotein that is primarily involved in the organization and maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Papilin plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, which are essential for tissue integrity and development. As an extracellular matrix component, papilin interacts with other matrix proteins to facilitate tissue development and repair. Notably, in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the overexpression of PAPLN has been linked to improved prognosis, indicating its potential regulatory role in disease modulation (Lv2018Circular). Despite its recognized importance in pathological conditions, the detailed mechanisms of papilin's function in normal human physiology are not yet fully understood.

## Structure


## Function
PAPLN encodes papilin, a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the organization of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in crucial molecular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, which are essential for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating developmental processes. Papilin is active in the extracellular space, where it interacts with other matrix components to support tissue development and repair. Its functions are vital for ensuring proper tissue structure and function, contributing to the organism's overall health and development. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the overexpression of PAPLN has been associated with a better prognosis, suggesting its potential role in modulating disease outcomes (Lv2018Circular). This indicates that papilin may have protective or regulatory functions in pathological conditions, although its precise mechanisms in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
