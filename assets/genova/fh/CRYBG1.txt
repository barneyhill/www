# CRYBG1

## Overview
CRYBG1 is a gene that encodes the protein crystallin beta-gamma domain containing 1, which is part of the crystallin family known for their structural roles in the eye lens and other tissues. This protein is characterized by its beta-gamma crystallin domain, which is typically involved in maintaining cellular transparency and refractive properties. While the precise biological functions of CRYBG1 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Notably, alterations in CRYBG1 expression have been associated with conditions such as cholesteatoma and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, suggesting its potential involvement in pathogenesis and as a target for therapeutic intervention (Xavier2019Treatment; Lee2023Novel).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CRYBG1 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cholesteatoma, a rare benign disease of the middle ear, a study identified a variant in CRYBG1, specifically NM_001371242:c.1366G>A [p.(Ala456Thr)], which is predicted to be damaging. This variant was found to have a minor allele frequency of 0.0002 in the AMR population and a high CADD score of 23.4, indicating its potential pathogenicity (Lee2023Novel). The study also noted that CRYBG1 was among the differentially expressed genes in cholesteatoma, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Lee2023Novel).

In hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL), CRYBG1 expression is notably downregulated. This rare type of lymphoma is characterized by massive liver and spleen enlargement and is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. However, novel targeted therapies, such as SYK inhibitors and demethylating agents like decitabine, have shown promise in increasing CRYBG1 transcripts, potentially offering a therapeutic avenue (Xavier2019Treatment). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CRYBG1 in both cholesteatoma and HSTL, underscoring its role in disease mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.
