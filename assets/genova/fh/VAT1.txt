# VAT1

## Overview
The VAT1 gene encodes the vesicle amine transport 1 protein, which is a member of the medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in vesicular transport processes and plays a significant role in membrane dynamics and signaling within cells. VAT1 is characterized by its potential oxidoreductase and ATPase activities, although these functions have not been fully confirmed experimentally (Hayess1998Mammalian). The protein is known to bind phosphatidic acid and translocate to neutrophil membranes upon stimulation, implicating it in critical cellular functions such as migration, exocytosis, and phagocytosis (Faugaret2011An). Additionally, VAT1 is involved in various protein interactions, including those with Talin-1 and phosphatases like PTPN6 and PTPN1, which are essential for integrin activation and signal transduction pathways (Dong2022Vesicle; Gleissner2019Neocarzilin). The gene's expression is notably altered in certain pathological conditions, such as glioblastoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia, where it contributes to disease progression through its roles in cell migration and proliferation (Shan2019High; Mori2011VAT‐1).

## Structure
The VAT1 protein, encoded by the human VAT1 gene, is homologous to the VAT-1 protein from Torpedo californica and is part of the medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases superfamily (Hayess1998Mammalian). The primary structure of the human VAT1 protein shows approximately 97% sequence identity with its murine counterpart, indicating a high degree of conservation across species (Hayess1998Mammalian). The protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa, based on an extended exon 1, although the observed mass in murine models is 48 kDa (Hayess1998Mammalian).

VAT1 may possess oxidoreductase activity, as suggested by its classification within the dehydrogenases/reductases superfamily, although this activity has not been experimentally confirmed (Hayess1998Mammalian). The protein is known to exist in two isoforms with isoelectric points of approximately 5.8 and 5.7, which may result from alternative splicing or post-translational modifications (Hayess1998Mammalian). The VAT1 protein's structure and function are further characterized by its potential ATPase activity, as evidenced by the release of [33P]phosphate from [γ-33P]ATP (Hayess1998Mammalian).

## Function
The human VAT1 gene encodes a protein involved in vesicular transport processes within cells, particularly in the context of membrane dynamics and signaling. VAT1 is a phosphatidic acid (PA)-binding protein that translocates to neutrophil membranes upon stimulation, a process influenced by phospholipase D (PLD) activity. This translocation is crucial for VAT1's role in membrane trafficking and possibly in regulating neutrophil functions such as migration, exocytosis, and phagocytosis (Faugaret2011An).

In human epithelial cells, VAT1 is identified as a calcium-regulated activation marker. Its expression is upregulated in keratinocytes during reepithelialization, suggesting a role in epidermal repair mechanisms. VAT1 is not expressed in normal epidermis but is present in lesional epidermis in certain skin diseases, indicating its involvement in cellular responses to inflammatory conditions (Koch2003Human).

VAT1 is also expressed in human neutrophils, where it localizes to the cytosol and intracytoplasmic membrane compartments. It is recruited to membranes in a calcium-independent manner by PLD-derived PA, suggesting a role in membrane trafficking and protein translation regulation (Faugaret2011An).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VAT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly glioblastoma (GBM) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In glioblastoma, high VAT1 expression is associated with the mesenchymal subtype and is considered a prognostic biomarker for poor overall survival. It is linked to processes such as proteolysis, oxidation-reduction, immune response, angiogenesis, and hypoxia, which are critical in tumor development and progression (Shan2019High). VAT1 expression is significantly higher in glioblastoma tissues compared to nonneoplastic brain tissues, and its knockdown results in reduced cell migration, suggesting a role in tumor invasiveness (Mertsch2009Vesicle).

In benign prostatic hyperplasia, VAT1 expression is elevated in stromal components of BPH tissues. It is involved in cell proliferation, contributing to the progression of BPH. Knockdown of VAT1 in prostate stromal cells leads to reduced cell proliferation, indicating its potential role as a pathogenic factor in BPH (Mori2011VAT‐1). These findings suggest that VAT1 could serve as a therapeutic target in both glioblastoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia due to its involvement in cell migration and proliferation.

## Interactions
VAT1 (vesicle amine transport 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with Talin-1, a protein essential for integrin activation and cell motility. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays, highlighting VAT1's role in cell adhesion and migration (Gleissner2019Neocarzilin). 

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), VAT1 is implicated in the regulation of the EGF-induced STAT3 signaling pathway. It interacts with phosphatases such as PTPN6 and PTPN1, which are involved in modulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705, a critical step for STAT3 activation and subsequent gene transcription (Dong2022Vesicle). 

VAT1 also interacts with Benz, a compound with a suppressive effect on prostatic stromal tissue hyperplasia. This interaction was confirmed using a Benz-conjugated affinity matrix and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis, demonstrating a direct and tight binding between VAT1 and Benz (Mori2011VAT‐1). These interactions suggest that VAT1 plays a multifaceted role in various cellular pathways, influencing processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and signal transduction.
