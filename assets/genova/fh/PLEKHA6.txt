# PLEKHA6

## Overview
PLEKHA6 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A6, which is involved in various cellular processes, including copper homeostasis and cellular signaling. The protein is characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, WW domains, and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its interactions with phosphoinositides and other proteins, influencing its localization and function within cells. PLEKHA6 plays a critical role in the trafficking and localization of the Menkes ATPase ATP7A, particularly in response to elevated copper levels, thereby maintaining copper homeostasis. It is expressed in diverse tissues, including endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons, and is localized at adherens junctions and lateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells. The gene has been implicated in various diseases, such as schizophrenia and cancer, and is considered a potential biomarker for conditions like lung cancer prognosis and osteoporosis with sarcopenia (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5; Zhou2024Identification; Hu2022Integrated; Sluysmans2021WW).

## Structure
PLEKHA6 is a protein characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, WW domains, and coiled-coil domains. The PH domain is involved in binding phosphoinositides, which plays a role in targeting the protein to specific membrane sites. The PH domains of PLEKHA6 show interactions with various phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acid, although they are not required for junctional localization (Sluysmans2021WW). The WW domains, which are Trp-Trp motifs, are not essential for the junctional localization of PLEKHA6 but are involved in protein-protein interactions, such as the association with PDZD11, which is crucial for the localization of transmembrane proteins (Sluysmans2021WW). The C-terminal region of PLEKHA6 is critical for its localization at adherens junctions and along lateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells (Sluysmans2021WW). The coiled-coil region, although not solely responsible for localization, contributes to the structural integrity of the protein (Sluysmans2021WW). The study of PLEKHA6 involved expressing mutant and chimeric proteins to understand the structural basis for their localization, highlighting the cooperative interactions between protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions in determining the localization of WW-PLEKHAs (Sluysmans2021WW).

## Function
PLEKHA6 is involved in the regulation of copper homeostasis in human cells. It interacts with PDZD11 and the Menkes ATPase ATP7A, playing a crucial role in the trafficking and localization of ATP7A to the cell periphery in response to elevated copper levels. This process is essential for maintaining low intracellular copper levels, as PLEKHA6, along with PLEKHA5 and PLEKHA7, facilitates the anterograde targeting of ATP7A to the cell periphery, which is necessary for copper efflux (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

PLEKHA6 is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons, where it is detected along basolateral membranes and apical adherens junctions. Its knockout affects ATP7A's localization, indicating its role in targeting ATP7A to specific membrane domains (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5). The protein's WW domains interact with the N-terminal proline-rich region of PDZD11, forming a complex that regulates ATP7A's localization and function (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

In addition to its role in copper homeostasis, PLEKHA6 is implicated in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds phosphoinositides and proteins, influencing cell shape, motility, and communication (Spellmann2014Pleckstrin).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHA6 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In schizophrenia, polymorphisms in the PLEKHA6 gene have been associated with variations in psychopathology and response to antipsychotic treatment. Specific polymorphisms, such as rs4951353 and rs7513240, have shown significant associations with improvements in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores, suggesting that PLEKHA6 may influence the efficacy of antipsychotic therapies (Spellmann2014Pleckstrin).

In cancer, PLEKHA6 has been identified as a potential biomarker for lung cancer prognosis. High expression levels of PLEKHA6 correlate with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in lung cancer patients, indicating its potential as a novel survival predictor (Hu2022Integrated). Additionally, a fusion gene involving PLEKHA6, known as PLEKHA6-NTRK3, has been discovered in a pediatric patient with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH). This fusion gene activates the MAP kinase pathway, contributing to cell growth and proliferation, and suggests a role in LCH pathogenesis (Cai2018A).

PLEKHA6 has also been identified as a candidate biomarker for diagnosing osteoporosis with sarcopenia, with high diagnostic value indicated by machine learning analyses (Zhou2024Identification). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various pathological conditions through its altered expression or genetic mutations.

## Interactions
PLEKHA6 interacts with the protein PDZD11 through its N-terminal tandem WW domains. This interaction is crucial for targeting the Menkes ATPase ATP7A to the cell periphery, which is important for regulating copper homeostasis. The WW domains of PLEKHA6 bind to the N-terminal proline-rich region of PDZD11, facilitating the formation of a complex that includes ATP7A. This complex is essential for the trafficking and membrane delivery of ATP7A, particularly under conditions of elevated copper levels (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

PLEKHA6, along with PLEKHA5 and PLEKHA7, enhances the interaction between the PDZ-binding motif of ATP7A and PDZD11, promoting ATP7A's localization at the cell periphery. This interaction is not required for ATP7A's localization in the Golgi under basal copper conditions but is necessary for its peripheral localization when copper levels are high (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

The localization of PLEKHA6 at adherens junctions and lateral contacts is stabilized by its WW domains, which also facilitate the accumulation of PDZD11 along these sites. This suggests a role for PLEKHA6 in maintaining cellular junction integrity and copper homeostasis (Sluysmans2021WW).
