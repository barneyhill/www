# SLC5A2

## Overview
The SLC5A2 gene encodes the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. SGLT2 is primarily expressed in the proximal tubules, where it facilitates the reuptake of glucose from the renal filtrate back into the bloodstream, thus maintaining glucose homeostasis (Lewis2021“SLComics”; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). This protein operates with a sodium-to-glucose coupling ratio of 1:1, leveraging the sodium gradient to drive glucose transport (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). As a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter, SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorbing the majority of filtered glucose, preventing its loss in urine and ensuring energy balance (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). Mutations in the SLC5A2 gene can lead to familial renal glucosuria, underscoring its critical role in glucose transport and homeostasis (Li2019A).

## Structure
The SLC5A2 gene encodes the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), a protein primarily involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. The SGLT2 protein consists of 672 amino acids and includes 14 transmembrane helices, which are integral to its function in transporting glucose across the cell membrane (Li2019A; Unno2023Mouse). The transmembrane domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind and translocate glucose, with the C-terminal domain playing a significant role in determining sugar affinity and selectivity (Li2019A).

The primary structure of SGLT2 is a linear sequence of amino acids, while its secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices that span the membrane. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, forming a functional transporter. SGLT2 functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure (Wright2013Glucose).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, potentially affecting the protein's stability and function (Wright2013Glucose). Mutations in the SLC5A2 gene can lead to familial renal glucosuria, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper glucose transport (OttossonLaakso2016Influence).

## Function
The SLC5A2 gene encodes the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which is primarily expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. SGLT2 plays a crucial role in glucose reabsorption by transporting glucose from the renal filtrate back into the bloodstream, thus maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body (Lewis2021“SLComics”; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). This transporter operates with a sodium-to-glucose coupling ratio of 1:1, utilizing the sodium gradient to facilitate glucose uptake (Li2019A; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

SGLT2 is a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter responsible for reabsorbing approximately 90% of the filtered glucose load in the proximal tubule S1 segments of the kidney (Inthasot2024A; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). This function is essential for preventing glucose loss in urine and ensuring energy balance (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). The activity of SGLT2 is complemented by SGLT1, which reabsorbs the remaining glucose in the later segments of the proximal tubule (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

Mutations in the SLC5A2 gene can lead to familial renal glucosuria, a condition characterized by the excretion of glucose in the urine despite normal blood glucose levels, highlighting the gene's importance in glucose transport and homeostasis (Li2019A; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC5A2 gene, which encodes the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), are primarily associated with familial renal glucosuria (FRG). This condition is characterized by the excretion of glucose in the urine despite normal blood glucose levels. FRG is typically a benign condition with a favorable prognosis and does not usually require specific treatment (Inthasot2024A). The inheritance pattern of FRG can be autosomal dominant or recessive, with incomplete penetrance in heterozygous carriers (Inthasot2024A).

Mutations in SLC5A2 can lead to varying degrees of glucosuria, with severe cases often resulting from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (Li2019A). These mutations can affect the function of SGLT2, leading to impaired glucose reabsorption in the kidneys (Yu2020SLC5A2). Some mutations, such as the novel missense mutation c.1319G>A:p.W440X, result in decreased SLC5A2 expression and function, contributing to glucosuria (Yu2016Novel).

Alterations in SLC5A2 expression can also be linked to renal Fanconi syndrome, which involves proximal tubule dysfunction and can lead to symptoms like polyuria, enuresis, and weight loss due to glucose loss (Inthasot2024A).

## Interactions
The SLC5A2 gene encodes the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which is primarily involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. SGLT2 interacts with several proteins that influence its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with MAP17, an integral membrane protein that enhances SGLT2's glucose uptake activity when co-expressed. This interaction is crucial for the full functional expression of SGLT2, as MAP17 significantly increases its glucose transport capacity (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

SGLT2 also interacts with PDZK1, a scaffolding protein, although this interaction is not essential for the enhancement of SGLT2 activity by MAP17 (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). Another protein, MARDI, which is structurally related to MAP17, also enhances SGLT2-mediated glucose uptake, suggesting a role in modulating SGLT2 activity (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

In addition to these interactions, SGLT2 is part of a broader interaction network that includes proteins such as SIRT1, insulin (INS), renin (REN), albumin (ALB), and adiponectin (ADIPOQ). These interactions are linked to various physiological processes, including insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis (Wicik2022Characterization).
