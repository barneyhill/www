# H3C1

## Overview
The H3C1 gene encodes the H3 clustered histone 1 protein, a variant of histone H3, which is a fundamental component of the nucleosome structure in eukaryotic cells. This histone variant plays a pivotal role in the organization and compaction of DNA within the nucleus, thereby influencing gene expression and chromatin dynamics. As a core histone, H3 clustered histone 1 is integral to the regulation of essential cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcription. The protein is involved in various post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. Dysregulation of H3C1 expression and function has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its significance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (McClellan2023Impact; Sato2024CalcineurinNFATc1; Zhang2021CPLM).

## Structure


## Function
The H3C1 gene encodes a variant of histone H3, which is a core component of the nucleosome, playing a crucial role in DNA packaging within the nucleus. This histone variant is involved in regulating gene expression and maintaining chromatin structure, which are essential for various cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation (Zhang2021CPLM).

In healthy human cells, the H3C1 protein is involved in the transcriptional repression of histone genes, including its own, through the calcineurin/NFATc1 pathway. This pathway is activated by intracellular calcium levels, which enhance NFATc1 binding to histone promoters, thereby reducing histone mRNA expression. This regulation is vital for preventing excess histone H3 accumulation, which can inhibit cell proliferation and lead to genomic instability (Sato2024CalcineurinNFATc1).

The suppression of histone mRNA expression via the calcineurin/NFATc1 pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cytotoxicity. This mechanism ensures that histone expression is tightly regulated, particularly outside the S phase of the cell cycle, to avoid defects in cell cycle progression and genome stability (Sato2024CalcineurinNFATc1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the H3C1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD), the expression levels of H3C1 are significantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls. This suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, particularly histone acetylation involving H3C1, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD, contributing to neuronal loss (Küçükali2024Gene).

In the context of cancer, a rare variant of the H3C1 gene has been associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk in Black South African men. This variant was found to have a significant association with PCa, indicating that genetic variants in H3C1 contribute to the genetic liability of the disease (Soh2023Prostate). Interestingly, the variant was only present in controls, suggesting a potential protective effect against PCa (Soh2023Prostate).

In gliomas, particularly high-grade gliomas, mutations in histone 3 genes, including H3C1, are linked to epigenetic dysregulation. These mutations contribute to gliomagenesis and tumor progression, highlighting the role of H3C1 in the tumor microenvironment and its impact on immune responses (McClellan2023Impact).

## Interactions
The H3C1 gene encodes a histone protein that is involved in various protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications. In the context of breast cancer, H3C1 interacts with proteins such as CCT6B, SGTA, and UGGT2 in basal breast cancer subtypes, while it is downregulated in luminal breast cancer (Jiao2024DSBSOBased). The H3C1 protein also participates in a high degree of interactions within the PTM-associated PPI network, with significant roles in regulating protein-protein interactions through acetylation and methylation at the K10 site. These modifications influence interactions with proteins like BAZ1B, BRD7, CHD4, and TRIM33 (Hong2022PTMint).

Additionally, the interaction between H3C1 and Hepatoma derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HDGFL2) is regulated by phosphorylation. The dephosphorylated form of HDGFL2 maintains interaction with H3C1, while the phosphorylated form does not, indicating a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism (Floyd2021Systematic). The calcineurin/NFATc1 pathway also plays a role in modulating histone H3 expression, with NFATc1 binding to the promoter regions of histone genes, including H3C1, to repress transcription in a calcium-dependent manner (Sato2024CalcineurinNFATc1).
