# OTULINL

## Overview
The OTULINL gene encodes a protein known as FAM105A, which is classified as a pseudodeubiquitinase within the OTU (ovarian tumor) domain family. Unlike its paralog OTULIN, which actively participates in the cleavage of linear ubiquitin chains, FAM105A is structurally incapable of such activity due to deficiencies in its catalytic triad. This protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it is thought to play a role in ER-organelle communication rather than direct ubiquitin interaction. Despite its structural similarity to OTULIN, FAM105A does not engage in LUBAC-dependent NF-kB signaling, highlighting its distinct functional role. The evolutionary conservation of certain surface residues suggests a potential function in protein interactions, although the precise biochemical and cellular roles of FAM105A remain to be fully elucidated (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

## Structure
The FAM105A protein, also known as OTULINL, is characterized by its pseudodeubiquitinase nature within the OTU-class, localizing primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Structurally, FAM105A shares a similar domain architecture with OTULIN, consisting of an unstructured N-terminal region followed by an OTU domain. However, the N-terminal region of FAM105A includes a predicted membrane localization motif, distinguishing it from OTULIN, which contains a conserved HOIP interaction motif (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

The OTU domain of FAM105A is structurally similar to that of OTULIN, yet it is defective in its catalytic triad, rendering it incapable of cleaving ubiquitin chains (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). This defect is further supported by amino acid substitutions that affect its ability to bind ubiquitin chains, as confirmed by NMR and thermal shift assays (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). Despite these structural similarities, FAM105A does not participate in LUBAC-dependent NF-kB signaling, a pathway modulated by OTULIN (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

The protein's localization to the ER is facilitated by a conserved hydrophobic region, and its interactome suggests a potential role in ER-organelle communication (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). The high evolutionary conservation of certain surface residues indicates a potential protein interaction function, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the available data (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

## Function
The FAM105A gene, also known as OTULINL, encodes a protein that functions as a pseudodeubiquitinase of the OTU-class, localizing primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in human cells (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). Unlike its paralog OTULIN, FAM105A lacks the ability to cleave linear ubiquitin chains and does not participate in LUBAC-dependent NF-kB signaling, indicating a distinct functional role (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). The protein is characterized by structural deficiencies in its catalytic and substrate-binding domains, which prevent it from interacting with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

FAM105A is thought to have evolved an adaptor function, potentially related to processes at the ER membrane, rather than direct ubiquitin interaction (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). It interacts with proteins associated with the ER and outer nuclear membrane, suggesting a role in ER-organelle communication (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). The protein's high evolutionary conservation of certain surface residues implies a potential function in protein interactions, although its exact biochemical and cellular roles remain to be fully elucidated (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

## Interactions
FAM105A, also known as OTULINL, is a pseudodeubiquitinase of the OTU-class that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Despite its structural similarity to OTULIN, FAM105A does not interact with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules, nor does it affect linear ubiquitin chains or NF-kB signaling when overexpressed (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). Immunoprecipitation assays suggest a weak interaction between FAM105A and HOIP, a component of the LUBAC complex, although this interaction does not influence LUBAC activity (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).

BioID analysis has identified that FAM105A interacts with proteins associated with the ER and outer nuclear membrane, indicating a potential role in ER-organelle communication (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). The FAM105A interactome includes proteins linked to membrane contact sites, but not components of the linear (de)ubiquitination machinery, suggesting that its functions may be distinct from ubiquitin chain cleavage and more related to membrane interactions (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL). The high evolutionary conservation of surface residues remote from the DUB active site suggests a potential protein interaction function, although the exact nature of these interactions remains unclear (Ceccarelli2019FAM105AOTULINL).
