# ENO1

## Overview
ENO1 is a gene that encodes the protein enolase 1, a multifunctional enzyme primarily involved in glycolysis, where it catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. This enzyme is categorized as a glycolytic enzyme and is essential for cellular energy production (Pancholi2001Multifunctional). Enolase 1 is a homodimeric protein with a TIM barrel structure, and it requires divalent metal ions, such as magnesium, for its catalytic activity (Andronicos1997The; Pancholi2001Multifunctional). Beyond its metabolic role, enolase 1 functions as a plasminogen receptor on the cell surface, contributing to processes like tissue remodeling and wound healing (Pancholi2001Multifunctional). It is also involved in various cellular processes, including stress responses and transcriptional regulation, and has been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer, due to its altered expression and interactions (Novelli2017Alpha-Enolase; Song2014Alpha-enolase).

## Structure
The ENO1 gene encodes the α-enolase protein, a multifunctional enzyme involved in glycolysis and other cellular processes. The protein is a homodimer, meaning it consists of two identical subunits, each with a molecular weight of approximately 46 kDa (Andronicos1997The). The α-enolase protein has a TIM barrel fold, characterized by eight alpha-helices and eight parallel beta-strands, which is a common structural motif in enzymes (Pancholi2001Multifunctional).

The active site of α-enolase is located in a cavity at the C-terminal ends of the barrel strands, with specific residues such as Glu168, Glu211, Lys345, and Lys396 playing crucial roles in its catalytic activity (Pancholi2001Multifunctional). The enzyme requires divalent metal ions, particularly magnesium, for its activity, which are non-covalently bound to the active site (Didiasova2019When).

Post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, regulate ENO1's function, affecting its catalytic activity, localization, and stability (Qiao2021Enolase). These modifications can influence the enzyme's role in glycolysis and its non-catalytic functions, such as plasminogen binding and involvement in cancer metastasis (Qiao2021Enolase; Didiasova2019When).

## Function
ENO1, also known as enolase 1, is a multifunctional protein primarily involved in glycolysis, where it catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a critical step in energy production (Ji2016Progress; Pancholi2001Multifunctional). This enzymatic activity is essential for normal cellular metabolism and energy production in healthy cells (Novelli2017Alpha-Enolase). ENO1 is abundantly expressed in most cells and is found in the cytoplasm, cell surface, and nuclei (Ji2016Progress).

Beyond its glycolytic function, ENO1 acts as a plasminogen receptor on the cell surface, facilitating the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is crucial for the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. This activity plays a significant role in tissue remodeling and wound healing (Novelli2017Alpha-Enolase; Pancholi2001Multifunctional). ENO1 is also involved in stress responses, such as hypoxic conditions, where it is upregulated to enhance anaerobic metabolism (Pancholi2001Multifunctional).

In addition to its enzymatic roles, ENO1 functions as a structural protein in the eye lens and as a heat shock protein in yeast, indicating its involvement in thermal tolerance and growth control (Pancholi2001Multifunctional). These diverse functions highlight ENO1's importance in various cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
ENO1 (enolase 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gliomas, ENO1 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with higher tumor grades and poor prognosis. Its knockdown inhibits glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor progression through pathways like PI3K/Akt (Song2014Alpha-enolase). In bladder cancer, ENO1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer characteristics. It is linked to immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Huang2022Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ENO1 is transferred via exosomes, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. It regulates integrin expression, contributing to malignant transformation (Jiang2020Exosome-derived). In non-small cell lung cancer, ENO1 interacts with the lncRNA AL355338, enhancing the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor cell survival. This interaction is associated with poor prognosis and increased cancer cell aggressiveness (Hua2021AL355338).

Pan-cancer analyses reveal that ENO1 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and tumor stage across multiple cancer types, although mutations in ENO1 do not significantly impact prognosis (Xu2021Enolase).

## Interactions
ENO1, also known as alpha-enolase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its multifunctional roles. It acts as a plasminogen receptor on the cell surface, facilitating processes like fibrinolysis and cell migration (Almaguel2021Alpha-Enolase:). ENO1 interacts with the c-myc P2 promoter, acting as a transcriptional repressor by forming DNA-protein complexes, which was demonstrated through electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Feo2000ENO1). 

ENO1 also interacts with the sporozoite surface protein Cpgp40 of Cryptosporidium parvum, playing a role in the parasite's invasion of host cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays (Wang2024Identification). 

In cancer biology, ENO1 interacts with Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70), enhancing its surface localization and promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. This interaction is considered a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies (Gulotta2023Identification). ENO1 also binds to the mitochondrial membrane, acting as an RNA chaperone and interacting with proteins like VDAC1, which is crucial for mitochondrial function (Didiasova2019When).
