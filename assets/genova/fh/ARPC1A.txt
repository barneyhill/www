# ARPC1A

## Overview
ARPC1A is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1A, a critical component of the ARP2/3 complex. This protein complex is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching, which are fundamental processes in cellular dynamics, including motility, shape maintenance, and intracellular transport. As a part of the ARP2/3 complex, ARPC1A plays a significant role in the formation of branched actin networks, facilitating dynamic actin remodeling within the cytoplasm (Dai2024Prognostic). The ARPC1A protein is categorized as a structural protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. In addition to its structural role, ARPC1A is implicated in various signaling pathways, particularly those related to cancer, such as the MAPK signaling pathway, where it influences processes like DNA replication and apoptosis (Dai2024Prognostic). The gene's expression has been associated with tumor progression and prognosis in certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease states (Dai2024Prognostic).

## Function
ARPC1A is a subunit of the ARP2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as motility, shape maintenance, and intracellular transport. This complex facilitates the formation of a branched actin network, which is crucial for dynamic actin remodeling within the cytoplasm (Dai2024Prognostic). ARPC1A is involved in regulating signaling pathways related to cancer, such as DNA replication, apoptosis, and the MAPK signaling pathway, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not detailed in the provided context (Dai2024Prognostic).

In the context of cancer, ARPC1A has been implicated in promoting tumor growth and cell proliferation, particularly through the MAPK signaling pathway. Knockout experiments have shown that reducing ARPC1A expression decreases cancer cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth (Dai2024Prognostic). While ARPC1A is upregulated in the absence of ARPC1B, it cannot fully compensate for the loss of ARPC1B, indicating that these proteins are not functionally interchangeable (Sindram2023ARPC5). The specific role of ARPC1A in healthy human cells remains less clear, as the context primarily focuses on its involvement in disease states.

## Clinical Significance
The ARPC1A gene is implicated in the progression of low-grade glioma (LGG), a type of brain tumor. Studies have shown that ARPC1A expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in tumor progression. The gene is involved in regulating signaling pathways related to cancer, such as the MAPK signaling pathway, which affects DNA replication, tumor proliferation, and apoptosis. Knockout experiments indicate that reducing ARPC1A expression decreases cell proliferation and increases apoptosis in LGG cells, highlighting its role in promoting cancer cell growth (Dai2024Prognostic).

ARPC1A has been identified as a significant independent risk factor for LGG, with higher expression levels associated with poorer prognosis. The gene's expression is used in nomogram models to predict survival rates for LGG patients, underscoring its prognostic relevance (Dai2024Prognostic). Despite its role in cancer progression, ARPC1A does not significantly affect immune cell infiltration or epithelial-mesenchymal transition in LGG (Dai2024Prognostic). These findings suggest that ARPC1A could serve as a potential biomarker for LGG, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications.

## Interactions
ARPC1A is a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin filament nucleation and branching. This complex is composed of seven subunits, including ARPC1A, ARPC1B, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, ARPC5, ACTR2, and ACTR3. ARPC1A has been identified as a putative substitute for ARPC1B within this complex. The interaction between ARPC1A and the other subunits of the Arp2/3 complex facilitates the formation of branched actin networks, which are essential for various cellular processes such as motility and endocytosis (Häupl2016Protein).

In the context of human protein kinase D2 (PKD2), ARPC1A has been shown to be enriched in PKD2 samples, indicating a potential interaction. The entire Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC1A, was successfully enriched in studies using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, suggesting a direct interaction with PKD2. This interaction is significant for actin remodeling and vesicle formation, particularly at the trans-Golgi network (Häupl2016Protein). 

While ARPC1A's interactions in cancer contexts, such as prostate cancer, have been studied, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in these contexts are not detailed in the provided excerpts (Chen2023ARPC1A).
