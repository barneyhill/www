# BRPF3

## Overview
BRPF3 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 3) is a gene that encodes a chromatin regulator protein involved in the modulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. The protein, also named BRPF3, is characterized by the presence of a bromodomain, two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, and a PWWP domain, which collectively facilitate the recognition of DNA and histone modifications. As a chromatin regulator, BRPF3 plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and chromatin remodeling by forming a tetrameric complex with the histone acetyltransferase HBO1 and other subunits such as ING5 and MEAF6. This complex is crucial for the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 14, a modification essential for DNA replication and the activation of replication origins (Yan2016The; Feng2015BRPF). Although BRPF3 is not essential for mouse development, it is highly expressed in the adult brain and testis, indicating its potential importance in specific tissues (Yan2016The). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where its downregulation is associated with poorer survival outcomes (Lu2021Gene).

## Structure
BRPF3 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 3) is a chromatin regulator with a complex molecular structure that includes several key domains. It contains two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, a bromodomain, and a PWWP domain, which are involved in recognizing DNA and histone modifications (Yan2016The). The PHD fingers are linked by a C2HC zinc knuckle, forming a unique bivalent domain that interacts with DNA and the N terminus of histone H3 (Yan2016The). The bromodomain in BRPF3 is part of a conserved helical fold comprising a left-handed bundle of four α helices, which is typical of bromodomains and allows for the recognition of acetylated lysine residues on histone tails (Lloyd2017Biological).

BRPF3 forms a tetrameric complex with the histone acetyltransferase HBO1 and other subunits like ING5 and MEAF6, indicating its role in chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation (Yan2016The). This complex specifically acetylates histone H3 at K14, a modification important for DNA replication (Feng2015BRPF). Despite its structural complexity, BRPF3 is not essential for mouse development and survival, unlike its paralogs BRPF1 and BRPF2 (Yan2016The). The protein is highly expressed in the adult brain and testis, and its disruption does not lead to compensatory changes in the expression of BRPF1 and BRPF2 (Yan2016The).

## Function
BRPF3 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 3) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of DNA replication and chromatin modification in healthy human cells. It forms a complex with the histone acetyltransferase HBO1, which specifically acetylates histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac). This acetylation is essential for the activation of replication origins, particularly those near transcription start sites (Feng2015BRPF). The BRPF3-HBO1 complex is critical for the accumulation of RPA1 and the maintenance of normal DNA replication rates, directing HBO1 to acetylate H3K14 at a large fraction of replication origins (Feng2015BRPF).

BRPF3 is involved in the activation of pre-replication complexes during the S phase of the cell cycle, facilitating the firing of dormant origins by affecting the loading of CDC45 and RPA onto chromatin (Feng2015BRPF). It also plays a role in protecting cells against replication stress-induced DNA damage by reducing Chk1 activation and the accumulation of DNA damage markers (Feng2015BRPF). In addition to its role in DNA replication, BRPF3 modulates chromatin structure and gene expression by stimulating the acetyltransferase activity of HBO1, particularly towards histones H3 and H4 (Yan2016The).

## Clinical Significance
BRPF3 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 3) has been implicated in the prognosis of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Studies have shown that BRPF3 expression is significantly downregulated in KIRC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, as higher expression levels of BRPF3 correlate with improved survival rates in KIRC patients. The gene is part of a prognostic risk signature that helps categorize patients into low-risk and high-risk groups, with the low-risk group demonstrating a higher survival rate (Lu2021Gene).

BRPF3 is also involved in various cellular processes, including histone modification and transcription regulation, which are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions. Alterations in BRPF3 expression can influence these processes, potentially affecting cell junctions and metastasis in cancer (Lu2021Gene). While BRPF3's role in other diseases is less well-documented, its involvement in chromatin remodeling suggests it may have broader implications in conditions where gene expression regulation is disrupted. However, specific clinical significance related to BRPF3 mutations or expression changes in other diseases has not been extensively reported (Bouché2017Benzoisoquinolinediones; Iyer2021A).

## Interactions
BRPF3 interacts with the HBO1 acetyltransferase, forming a tetrameric complex with HBO1, ING5, and MEAF6. This interaction enhances HBO1's enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, particularly towards histones H3, H2B, and H4 (Yan2016The). The N-terminal 127 residues of BRPF3 are sufficient for binding to HBO1, and this interaction is mediated by the MYST domain of HBO1 (Yan2016The). BRPF3 also interacts with ING5 and MEAF6, with the EPC-N2 domain of BRPF3 being crucial for these interactions (Yan2016The).

BRPF3 is involved in DNA replication, where it forms a complex with HBO1 to acetylate histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac), a modification important for replication origin activation (Feng2015BRPF). This complex is distinct from those formed by its paralogs BRPF1 and BRPF2, which associate with MOZ/MORF (Feng2015BRPF).

BRPF3 also regulates the stability of the Myst2 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination, which is mediated by Huwe1. This interaction is significant for cell-cycle progression and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (Cho2020BRPF3HUWE1mediated).
