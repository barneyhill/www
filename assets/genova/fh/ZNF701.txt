# ZNF701

## Overview
ZNF701 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 701, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their finger-like protrusions that facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. The protein encoded by ZNF701 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription, which is critical for maintaining normal cellular activities and homeostasis. Disruptions in the function or expression of ZNF701 can have significant implications, particularly in the context of diseases such as cancer, where it may contribute to abnormal cell growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is necessary to fully understand the diverse roles of ZNF701 in cellular physiology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ZNF701 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. As a zinc finger protein, ZNF701 plays a crucial role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, which are essential processes in maintaining normal cellular function. Disruptions in these processes due to mutations or changes in expression levels can lead to aberrant cell growth and differentiation, contributing to oncogenesis. The precise mechanisms by which ZNF701 mutations or expression alterations lead to cancer are still under investigation, but they are believed to involve the gene's interactions with other cellular components that regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. Given the gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation, any dysregulation could potentially affect a wide array of downstream targets, further complicating its role in disease pathogenesis. Understanding the clinical significance of ZNF701 requires further research to elucidate its specific contributions to disease states and to explore potential therapeutic targets for conditions associated with its dysregulation.
