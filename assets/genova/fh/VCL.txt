# VCL

## Overview
The VCL gene encodes vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular adhesion, motility, and mechanotransduction. Vinculin is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is integral to the structural integrity of cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions. It functions by linking integrins and cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating the transmission of mechanical forces and maintaining cellular architecture (Ziegler2006The; ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific). In cardiac tissues, vinculin is crucial for anchoring the sarcomere to the cell membrane, contributing to the mechanical stability of the heart (ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific). The protein's interactions with talin, actin, and other cytoskeletal components underscore its role as a scaffolding protein that influences cellular dynamics and responses (Thievessen2013Vinculin–actin). Mutations in the VCL gene have been linked to cardiac conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Zahavich2023Heart).

## Structure
Vinculin (VCL) is a cytoskeletal protein with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The protein is composed of an N-terminal head domain (Vh) and a C-terminal tail domain (Vt), connected by a proline-rich linker (Thompson2017A; Thompson2014Identification). The head domain is involved in binding to talin and actin, while the tail domain interacts with filamentous actin (F-actin) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Thompson2017A; Thompson2014Identification).

The Vt domain contains two basic regions known as the basic collar and the basic ladder, which are essential for lipid binding. The basic collar specifically recognizes PIP2, while the basic ladder interacts with acidic phospholipids (Thompson2017A). Mutations in these regions can impair PIP2 binding and affect vinculin's function in focal adhesions (Thompson2017A).

Vinculin also exists in a splice variant form known as metavinculin, which is expressed in muscle tissues. This variant includes an additional exon that encodes a 68-residue insert in the tail domain, which is thought to modulate its interaction with actin and other proteins (Thompson2014Identification). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate vinculin's activity and its interactions with other proteins (Thompson2017A).

## Function
The VCL gene encodes vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in cell adhesion, motility, and mechanotransduction. Vinculin is involved in linking integrins and cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton at cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, thereby maintaining cellular structure and transmitting mechanical forces (Ziegler2006The; ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific). In cardiac myocytes, vinculin is essential for anchoring the sarcomere to the cell membrane, contributing to the mechanical stability of the heart by maintaining the integrity of intercalated discs and costameres (ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific).

Vinculin interacts with talin and actin, playing a role in the regulation of focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. This interaction is crucial for the molecular clutch mechanism that couples F-actin retrograde flow to integrins in focal adhesions, which is important for cell movement and stability (Thievessen2013Vinculin–actin). Vinculin's interaction with acidic phospholipids is necessary for its release from focal adhesions, facilitating cell migration (Ziegler2006The).

In the context of cardiac function, vinculin is vital for preserving normal cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive structures, and its absence can lead to severe cardiac dysfunction, such as dilated cardiomyopathy (ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific). The protein's role in stabilizing focal adhesions and maintaining cellular junctions underscores its importance in tissue integrity and cellular responses (ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VCL gene, which encodes the protein vinculin, are associated with several cardiac conditions, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Studies have shown that loss-of-function (LOF) variants in the VCL gene can lead to left ventricular dilation and dysfunction. In some cases, patients with these variants experience normalization of heart function after treatment, while others may require interventions such as heart transplants (Zahavich2023Heart). The variability in clinical outcomes suggests that VCL mutations can result in a spectrum of cardiac phenotypes, from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (Zahavich2023Heart).

Research using mouse models has demonstrated that cardiac-myocyte-specific excision of the VCL gene disrupts cellular junctions, leading to severe cardiac conditions such as sudden death or DCM. These disruptions are due to the loss of vinculin's role in maintaining the structural integrity of cardiac cells, which can result in arrhythmias and heart failure (ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific). The absence of vinculin affects the expression and localization of critical proteins involved in cell adhesion, such as cadherin and connexin 43, further contributing to cardiac dysfunction (ZemljicHarpf2007CardiacMyocyteSpecific).

## Interactions
Vinculin (VCL) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in cell adhesion and motility through its interactions with various proteins. It binds to talin, a-actinin, and F-actin, which are essential for stabilizing focal adhesions and linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (Ziegler2006The; Thievessen2013Vinculin–actin). The interaction with talin involves vinculin-binding sites (VBSs) that are sufficient for vinculin activation, challenging the notion of an autoinhibited conformation (Ziegler2006The). Vinculin's head and tail domains interact intramolecularly, modulating its binding affinity to talin, with the head-tail interaction potentially regulating vinculin's recruitment and organization in adherens junctions (Johnson1994An).

Vinculin also interacts with FAK and paxillin, modulating signaling pathways important for cell motility (Ziegler2006The). Its interaction with F-actin is crucial for regulating actin retrograde flow and the spatial organization of lamellipodia and lamellum, influencing focal adhesion dynamics (Thievessen2013Vinculin–actin). Mutations affecting vinculin's conformation, such as those in the Vhd1 domain, can alter its interactions with talin and affect its dynamics at focal adhesions (Cohen2006A). These interactions highlight vinculin's role as a scaffolding protein that influences the behavior of its targets within the cell.
