# CFHR4

## Overview
The CFHR4 gene encodes the complement factor H-related protein 4, a member of the complement factor H protein family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the complement system, an essential component of the immune response. The protein is characterized by its structure composed of short consensus repeats (SCRs), also known as sushi domains, and exists in two isoforms, CFHR4A and CFHR4B, due to alternative splicing (Józsi2013Factor; Hebecker2010Molecular). CFHR4 is primarily found in human plasma, where it functions as a dimer and is involved in modulating complement activation on cell surfaces by interacting with components such as C3b and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Hellwage1997Biochemical; Mihlan2009Human). This protein is implicated in various physiological processes, including immune clearance and lipid metabolism, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Yu2022Identification; Cipriani2020Increased).

## Structure
The CFHR4 protein is composed of short consensus repeats (SCRs), also known as sushi domains, which are characteristic of the complement factor H protein family. CFHR4 exists in two isoforms, CFHR4A and CFHR4B, resulting from alternative splicing. CFHR4A consists of nine SCRs, while CFHR4B comprises five SCRs, corresponding to SCR1 and SCR6-9 of CFHR4A (Józsi2013Factor; Hebecker2010Molecular). The primary structure of CFHR4 includes conserved amino acids such as cysteine, proline, asparagine, glycine, leucine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, which are essential for the formation of the SCR domains (Skerka1997The).

The secondary structure of CFHR4 is defined by these SCR domains, which are highly related and show significant sequence identity, particularly in CFHR4A, where SCRs 1-4 and 5-8 represent internally duplicated domains (Mihlan2009Human). The tertiary structure involves the spatial arrangement of these SCRs, with homology modeling suggesting surface-exposed binding sites for interactions with other proteins, such as C-reactive protein (Hebecker2010Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, CFHR4 predominantly exists as a dimer in plasma, with a molecular mass of approximately 86 kDa, attributed to glycosylation differences between native and recombinant forms (Skerka1997The). Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that influences the protein's stability and function (Skerka1997The).

## Function
The CFHR4 gene encodes the complement factor H-related protein 4, which plays a significant role in the regulation of the complement system, a crucial component of the immune response. CFHR4 is primarily active in human plasma and is involved in modulating complement activation on cell surfaces. It binds to C3b, a component of the complement system, and this interaction is dose-dependent, suggesting a regulatory role in complement activation (Hellwage1997Biochemical). CFHR4 also interacts with C-reactive protein (CRP), particularly the native pentameric form, enhancing the opsonization of necrotic cells, which may contribute to immune clearance and inflammation modulation (Medjeral‐Thomas2016The; Mihlan2009Human).

CFHR4 is associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, indicating a potential role in lipid metabolism and transport (Skerka1997The; Hellwage1997Biochemical). The protein exists in a dimeric form in plasma, likely as a homodimer, and is glycosylated, which is essential for its structural integrity and function (Skerka1997The; Hellwage1997Biochemical). These interactions and structural features suggest that CFHR4 contributes to maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive complement activation, which can lead to tissue damage.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CFHR4 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to its role in the complement system. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, elevated levels of factor H-related protein 4 (FHR-4) are linked to increased disease risk. FHR-4 accumulates in the choriocapillaris, Bruch's membrane, and drusen, contributing to complement dysregulation by competing with complement factor H (FH) for C3b binding, which prevents the cleavage of C3b and leads to complement activation (Cipriani2020Increased). Genetic variants at the CFH locus, such as rs10922109, are associated with FHR-4 levels and AMD risk, with lower FHR-4 levels being protective against AMD (Cipriani2020Increased).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CFHR4 expression is significantly decreased, and low expression levels are associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and progression-free intervals. CFHR4 expression in HCC is linked to immune cell infiltration and various signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yu2022Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CFHR4 in both AMD and HCC.

## Interactions
CFHR4 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in the immune system's complement pathway. It binds to C-reactive protein (CRP), specifically the native pentameric form (pCRP), in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is facilitated by the first short consensus repeat (SCR) domain of CFHR4, with specific residues (35-41) being crucial for binding. The binding of CFHR4 to CRP is distinct from that of complement factor H, which primarily interacts with monomeric CRP (mCRP) (Hebecker2010Molecular; Mihlan2009Human).

CFHR4 also binds to the complement component C3b and its fragment C3d, but not to C3c. This interaction suggests a role in modulating the complement system, as CFHR4 enhances the cofactor activity of factor H in the factor I-mediated inactivation of C3b (Hellwage1999Functional). The protein is present in human plasma in a dimeric form and is associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Hellwage1997Biochemical). CFHR4's interactions with CRP and C3b indicate its involvement in immune response regulation and the clearance of necrotic cells (Mihlan2009Human).
