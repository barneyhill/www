# CEACAM4

## Overview
CEACAM4, or carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CEACAM family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein, CEA cell adhesion molecule 4, is characterized by a single immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic domain containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. This structure facilitates its role as a transmembrane protein involved in cell-cell adhesion and immune response modulation. CEACAM4 is primarily expressed on certain immune cells, where it plays a crucial role in pathogen recognition and clearance through opsonin-independent phagocytosis. The protein's interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as Src family kinases, are essential for its function in signal transduction and immune response. CEACAM4 has also been implicated in cancer research, with specific mutations associated with breast cancer risk in African American populations, although its role as a significant risk gene for cancer remains to be fully elucidated (Delgado2015The; Huskey2021CEACAM).

## Structure
CEACAM4 is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein structure of CEACAM4 includes a single immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like extracellular domain. This domain is approximately 110 amino acids long and contains conserved amino acids that stabilize the Ig-like fold through an intradomain salt bridge (Pavlopoulou2014A). The IgV-like domain of CEACAM4 shares a 49% amino acid identity with CEACAM3, particularly in the CFG face of the Ig fold (Delgado2015The).

CEACAM4 also contains a cytoplasmic domain with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence, which is crucial for its function in signal transduction and phagocytosis. This ITAM-like sequence includes tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated, facilitating interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins such as Src family kinases, PI3KR3, and Nck2 (Delgado2015The). The phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is essential for the opsonin-independent uptake of bacteria (Delgado2015The).

The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CEACAM4 are not detailed in the available context, and no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is provided.

## Function
CEACAM4 (CEA cell adhesion molecule 4) is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion processes. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular functions, including the modulation of immune responses and cellular signaling pathways. CEACAM4 is typically expressed on certain immune cells, where it contributes to the recognition and clearance of pathogens. By facilitating cell-cell adhesion, CEACAM4 helps maintain tissue architecture and integrity, which is crucial for normal cellular function and organismal health. Its involvement in immune response modulation suggests that CEACAM4 may play a role in the body's defense mechanisms against infections, potentially influencing the efficiency of pathogen recognition and the subsequent immune response. The precise molecular activities of CEACAM4 within the cell, including its specific signaling pathways and interactions with other cellular components, are essential for understanding its function in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM4 has been studied in the context of breast cancer, particularly among African American populations. Two specific stop gain mutations in CEACAM4, c.367C > T;p.R123X and c.424C > T;p.Q142X, have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in African American women. These mutations were not found in European American cases or controls and are rare in the general African American population. However, they were significantly more prevalent in African American breast cancer cases compared to ethnic-matched controls, suggesting a potential role in breast cancer risk for this demographic (Huskey2021CEACAM).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), a missense variant in CEACAM4 (c.368G > A, p.(R123E)) was identified in European American cases. This variant was predicted to be benign and was not associated with an increased risk of CRC (Huskey2022An). Overall, while some mutations in CEACAM4 have been linked to cancer risk, the gene-based aggregation analyses have not consistently supported CEACAM4 as a significant risk gene for these cancers, indicating the need for further research with larger cohorts to validate these findings (Huskey2021CEACAM; Huskey2022An).

## Interactions
CEACAM4 interacts with several proteins through its ITAM-like sequence, which becomes tyrosine phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is crucial for CEACAM4's role in phagocytosis, as it allows the protein to bind with SH2 domain-containing proteins. In particular, CEACAM4 has been shown to associate with Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) such as Hck, Lck, and Yes, as well as the amino-terminal SH2 domain of the PI3K regulatory domain g (PI3KR3-N) and the Nck2 SH2 domain. These interactions were confirmed through GST pull-down assays and peptide spot membranes, demonstrating that the phosphorylated tyrosine residues (pY222 and pY233) of CEACAM4 serve as binding sites for these SH2 domains (Delgado2015The).

Upon bacterial engagement, CEACAM4 recruits specific SH2 domains, including the Yes-SH2 domain, PI3KR3 amino-terminal SH2 domain, and Nck2 SH2 domain, to the sites where bacteria colocalize with the receptor. This recruitment indicates that CEACAM4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and interacts with these SH2 domains in intact cells. Src family kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of the CEACAM4 ITAM, which is necessary for phagocytosis. The use of a Src PTK inhibitor, PP2, demonstrated the critical role of these kinases in the uptake of bacteria, highlighting the functional relevance of these interactions for opsonin-independent bacterial internalization (Delgado2015The).
