# HBQ1

## Overview
The HBQ1 gene encodes the hemoglobin subunit theta 1, a protein that is part of the hemoglobin family, which is primarily known for its role in oxygen transport in the blood. Unlike the more common hemoglobin subunits, theta 1 is less well-characterized and is not typically involved in the formation of functional hemoglobin tetramers. Recent studies have highlighted its potential role in oncogenesis, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where it appears to function as an oncogene. The protein's ability to modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels suggests it may have a protective role for cancer cells against oxidative stress, thereby promoting tumor growth and progression (Kim2023Hemoglobin). This emerging evidence positions HBQ1 as a candidate for further research into its utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment strategies.

## Clinical Significance
The HBQ1 gene, also known as hemoglobin subunit theta 1, has been implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. Altered expression of HBQ1 is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with this type of cancer. Specifically, HBQ1 expression is significantly upregulated in cancerous lung tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role as an oncogene. High levels of HBQ1 expression correlate with poorer overall survival and first progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Kim2023Hemoglobin).

Research indicates that HBQ1 promotes cancer cell proliferation by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which can otherwise cause oxidative stress and damage cellular components. This antioxidant property of HBQ1 helps protect cancer cells from oxidative stress, thereby facilitating tumor growth and progression (Kim2023Hemoglobin). In vivo studies using mouse xenograft models have shown that knockdown of HBQ1 results in decreased tumor volume and weight, highlighting its critical role in lung cancer growth (Kim2023Hemoglobin). These findings suggest that HBQ1 could serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention in lung adenocarcinoma.
