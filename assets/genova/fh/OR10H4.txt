# OR10H4

## Overview
OR10H4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily H member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Olender2016The). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR10H4 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, where it may influence processes such as cell proliferation and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). Additionally, OR10H4 has been implicated in cancer research, particularly in relation to hypomethylated regions in prostate cancer, although its precise role in cancer biology is not yet fully understood (Santourlidis2024Epigenetics; AraúzoBravo2022Consistent).

## Function
OR10H4 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR10H4 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Olender2016The).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR10H4 is expressed in other tissues, including the skin, where it may be involved in various cellular processes such as epidermal/keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production. The downregulation of OR10H4 in individuals with sensitive skin suggests a potential role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, although it is unclear whether this downregulation is a cause or consequence of skin sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

OR10H4 has also been identified in studies related to cancer, where it is associated with hypomethylated regions in prostate cancer tissues, although its specific function in cancer cell biology remains to be fully elucidated (Santourlidis2024Epigenetics; AraúzoBravo2022Consistent).
