# CRCT1

## Overview
The CRCT1 gene encodes the cysteine-rich C-terminal 1 protein, which is characterized by its high cysteine content and is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in modulating cellular pathways and interactions. The CRCT1 protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and may play a role in cellular stress responses and signaling pathways. Its expression and function are of particular interest in the context of certain diseases, where alterations in CRCT1 activity have been observed. Research into CRCT1 continues to uncover its potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
