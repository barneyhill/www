# KRT75

## Overview
KRT75 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 75, a type II epithelial alpha-keratin. This protein is integral to the structural integrity of hair and nails, forming part of the intermediate filament network that provides mechanical strength to keratinized tissues. Keratin 75 is primarily expressed in the hair follicle and plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of hair structure, as well as in the structural organization of tooth enamel. The protein's ability to form coiled-coil dimers and assemble into intermediate filaments is crucial for its function. Mutations in the KRT75 gene have been linked to various hair and nail disorders, such as pseudofolliculitis barbae and the frizzle feather phenotype in chickens, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal keratin function (Chen2008Mice; Ng2012The).

## Structure
Keratin 75 (KRT75) is a type II epithelial alpha-keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair and nails. The protein consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This structure allows KRT75 to form coiled-coil dimers, which subsequently assemble into intermediate filaments, providing mechanical strength to keratinized tissues (Ng2012The).

The alpha-helical rod domain is essential for the protein's structural function, as it facilitates the formation of the coiled-coil dimers. These dimers are critical for the assembly of the intermediate filament network, which is necessary for maintaining the integrity of hair and nail structures (Ng2012The).

KRT75 is subject to post-translational modifications, which may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. These modifications can influence the protein's function and interactions within the cell (Ng2012The).

Mutations in KRT75 can lead to structural abnormalities, as seen in conditions like pseudofolliculitis barbae and the frizzle feather phenotype in chickens, highlighting the importance of its structural domains in maintaining normal keratin function (Ng2012The).

## Function
KRT75, or keratin 75, is a type II hair keratin gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair and nails. In healthy human cells, KRT75 is primarily expressed in the companion layer of the hair follicle, the upper germinative matrix, and the medulla of the hair shaft (Ng2012The; Chen2008Mice). It forms intermediate filaments that contribute to the stability of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells, which is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of hair structure (Liu2016Correction).

KRT75 is also involved in the structure and function of tooth enamel. It is present in enamel rod sheaths and contributes to the proper arrangement and cohesion of enamel rods during their formation. This role is crucial for maintaining the balance between hardness and fracture toughness of enamel, thereby enhancing resistance to caries (Duverger2016Keratins; Yang2019Trafficking). The presence of KRT75 in enamel is hypothesized to stabilize enamel rods, preventing the entry of lactic acid and the exit of dissolved minerals, which are critical for dental health (Duverger2016Keratins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT75 gene are associated with several hair and nail disorders. In humans, mutations in KRT75 can lead to conditions such as pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), a skin condition characterized by ingrown hairs and inflammation, particularly in areas subjected to shaving (Ng2012The). The A161T mutation in KRT75 is specifically linked to PFB and is also associated with increased susceptibility to dental caries due to compromised enamel integrity (Deshmukh2022Elucidating).

In mice, mutations in the Krt75 gene, analogous to human KRT75 mutations, result in hair and nail defects similar to those seen in pachyonychia congenita (PC), a rare genetic disorder characterized by nail dystrophy and skin abnormalities (Chen2008Mice). The N159del mutation in Krt75 leads to hair shaft abnormalities such as trichorrhexis nodosa and trichoptilosis, and may also affect nail development (Chen2008Mice). These findings suggest that KRT75 could be a candidate gene for screening PC patients, particularly those with significant hair involvement who do not have mutations in other known keratin genes (Chen2008Mice).

In chickens, a mutation in KRT75 causes the frizzle feather phenotype, characterized by defective rachis formation and altered feather morphology, which is due to a dominant-negative effect of the mutation (Ng2012The).

## Interactions
Keratin 75 (KRT75) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of enamel formation. KRT75 is known to colocalize significantly with enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) such as ameloblastin (AMBN) and amelogenin (AMELX) in secretory vesicles within ameloblasts and Tomes' processes. Approximately 90% of KRT75 colocalizes with either AMBN or AMELX, indicating a close association during the secretory stage of amelogenesis (Yang2019Trafficking). 

KRT75 is also found in secretory vesicles with EMPs, utilizing portions of the classical ER-Golgi secretory pathway despite being a cytosolic protein. This suggests that KRT75 may be cotransported with other secretory cargo through the Golgi apparatus (Yang2019Trafficking). The study of KRT75's trafficking revealed its colocalization with markers for the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi apparatus, suggesting an unconventional secretory pathway (Yang2019Trafficking).

Additionally, KRT75 is not associated with tonofilaments, unlike other keratins such as K14, highlighting its unique role and interactions within the cellular environment of ameloblasts (Yang2019Trafficking). These interactions are crucial for understanding the role of KRT75 in enamel development and its potential impact on dental health.
