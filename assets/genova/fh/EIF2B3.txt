# EIF2B3

## Overview
EIF2B3 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit gamma (eIF2Bγ), a component of the eIF2B complex, which is a critical guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF2B complex, comprising five subunits, including EIF2B3, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein synthesis by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a process essential for the initiation of mRNA translation (Lee2021Eif2b3; Oliveira2024The). EIF2B3, as part of the catalytic sub-complex, is integral to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of eIF2B, which is crucial for cellular stress responses and growth regulation (Abbott2004Translation; Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). Mutations in EIF2B3 are associated with vanishing white matter disease, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and neurological health (Lee2021Eif2b3).

## Function
EIF2B3 encodes the gamma subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a crucial guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the initiation of protein synthesis. eIF2B facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a process essential for the formation of the eIF2-GTP binary complex, which is necessary for the assembly of the GTP-eIF2•Met-tRNAi ternary complex. This complex is critical for the initiation of mRNA translation, a key step in protein synthesis (Oliveira2024The).

The eIF2B complex is composed of five subunits, including EIF2B3, and functions as a decameric protein. It is active in the cytoplasm and plays a vital role in cellular stress responses and growth regulation (Lee2021Eif2b3; Abbott2004Translation). The activity of eIF2B is particularly important under stress conditions, where it helps regulate protein synthesis by modulating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular function and preventing the accumulation of denatured proteins during stress (Abbott2004Translation).

Mutations in EIF2B3 and other eIF2B subunits can lead to disorders such as Vanishing White Matter disease, highlighting the importance of eIF2B in maintaining normal cellular function (Lee2021Eif2b3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2B3 gene are associated with vanishing white matter (VWM) disease, a type of leukodystrophy characterized by the progressive deterioration of white matter in the central nervous system. VWM disease can manifest at various ages, from early childhood to adulthood, with symptoms including ataxia, optic atrophy, and episodes of acute neurological deterioration triggered by stress (Lee2021Eif2b3; La2012AdultOnset). 

In childhood-onset cases, the disease is often severe, leading to rapid progression and early mortality. Adult-onset VWM tends to have a milder course, with symptoms such as behavioral changes, dementia, and seizures, and is less frequently associated with stress-related exacerbations (La2012AdultOnset). 

Research using zebrafish models has shown that EIF2B3 mutations can lead to defects in myelin development and glial cell differentiation, as well as increased expression of stress response genes and ectopic angiogenesis (Lee2021Eif2b3). These findings suggest that EIF2B3 is crucial for proper myelin and vascular development. The disease is linked to endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response pathway, which are activated by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins (Lee2021Eif2b3).

## Interactions
EIF2B3, also known as eIF2Bγ, is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, which plays a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis. EIF2B3 is part of the catalytic sub-complex of eIF2B, along with eIF2Bɛ (EIF2B5), and is essential for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity that facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2 (Wortham2015eIF2B:; Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). 

EIF2B3 interacts with eIF2Bɛ to form a catalytic heterodimer, which is a crucial step in the assembly of the eIF2B decameric complex. This heterodimer then associates with eIF2Bβ and eIF2Bδ to form a tetrameric subcomplex, which is further stabilized by an eIF2Bα homodimer to complete the decameric structure (Hodgson2024eIF2B). 

The eIF2B complex, including EIF2B3, is involved in the integrated stress response (ISR), where it is inhibited by the phosphorylation of eIF2α. This phosphorylation event locks eIF2B into an inactive state by slowing the dissociation of eIF2α-P from the regulatory subcomplex (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). The small molecule ISRIB can activate eIF2B by promoting its dimerization, which includes EIF2B3, thereby enhancing its GEF activity and counteracting the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2 (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).
