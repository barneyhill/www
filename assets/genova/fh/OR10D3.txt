# OR10D3

## Overview
OR10D3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily D member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory system. The OR10D3 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the complex process of odor recognition by binding specific odor molecules. The expression and regulation of OR10D3 are influenced by endogenous retroviral elements, highlighting the intricate regulatory mechanisms that govern olfactory receptor gene expression (Sokol2015Human; Olender2020A).

## Function
OR10D3 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR10D3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory detection (Olender2020A).

The transcriptional regulation of OR10D3 and other olfactory genes is influenced by endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), particularly the ERV9-LTR12 element. This element acts as a major transcriptional regulator of the olfactory locus, suggesting that ERV9-LTR12 is crucial for the expression of OR10D3 in certain cell lines, such as K562 and MCF7 (Sokol2015Human). The regulation of OR10D3 is cell-specific, with differences in epigenetic regulation affecting isoform expression (Sokol2015Human).

Overall, OR10D3 plays a significant role in the molecular processes of olfactory perception by binding odorants and initiating signaling pathways, which are essential for the organismal outcome of detecting and responding to environmental odors.
