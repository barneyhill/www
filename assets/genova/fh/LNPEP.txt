# LNPEP

## Overview
The LNPEP gene encodes the protein leucyl and cystinyl aminopeptidase, a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that plays a crucial role in peptide hormone processing. This enzyme is categorized within the M1 family of aminopeptidases and is characterized by its HEXXH(X)18E motif, essential for catalytic activity, and a conserved peptide substrate binding site known as 'GAMEN' (Elkins2017Identification; Tsujimoto2021Molecular). LNPEP is involved in various physiological processes, including the renin-angiotensin system, where it degrades peptide hormones such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and angiotensin III, thereby contributing to homeostasis and blood pressure regulation (Paladini2020The). Additionally, LNPEP functions as a receptor for angiotensin IV, influencing blood flow and immune responses (Paladini2020The). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, heart, and kidneys, and is implicated in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, pre-eclampsia, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Yong2014Increased; Ouyang2021Loss; Wilczyński2023Association).

## Structure
The LNPEP protein, also known as leucyl and cystinyl aminopeptidase, is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase involved in peptide hormone processing. It features a HEXXH(X)18E motif, which is crucial for its catalytic activity, and a conserved peptide substrate binding site known as 'GAMEN' (Elkins2017Identification; Tsujimoto2021Molecular). The protein is part of the M1 aminopeptidase family and shares structural similarities with human placental LNPEP, particularly in key functional regions (Elkins2017Identification).

The primary structure of LNPEP includes a sequence of 1033 amino acids, with a hydrophobic region and an N-terminus region that shows significant identity to the intracellular region of human placental LNPEP (Elkins2017Identification). The enzyme's active region spans residues 183-625, which includes the conserved motifs essential for its function (Elkins2017Identification).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may affect the stability and function of LNPEP, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which can result in distinct functional properties (Tsujimoto2021Molecular).

## Function
LNPEP, also known as leucyl and cystinyl aminopeptidase, is a multifunctional enzyme involved in several critical physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by degrading peptide hormones such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and angiotensin III, which contributes to maintaining homeostasis, particularly during pregnancy (Paladini2020The). LNPEP is predominantly expressed in the brain, heart, kidney, adrenals, and blood vessels, where it influences blood flow, neuroprotection, synaptogenesis, long-term potentiation, and memory consolidation (Paladini2020The).

LNPEP also acts as a receptor for angiotensin IV, which has protective roles in increasing blood flow in the kidney and brain and is involved in the inflammatory response by activating the NF-kB pathway (Paladini2020The). In the context of immune function, LNPEP is responsible for trimming cross-presented peptides in the endosomes of dendritic cells, refining extracellular epitopes, and potentially processing intracellular epitopes, highlighting its role in antigen presentation and immune response (Paladini2020The; Descamps2020The). The enzyme's activity is linked to the degradation of peptides with N-terminal ring structures, including angiotensin III and somatostatin, suggesting its broader role in hormone regulation (Elkins2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LNPEP gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), increased expression of LNPEP has been observed, suggesting a potential link to the disorder's clinical presentation. This increased expression is associated with higher levels of oxytocin and vasopressin, which are crucial for social cognition, potentially contributing to the social deficits observed in ASD (Wilczyński2023Association).

LNPEP is also implicated in pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition characterized by high blood pressure. Studies have shown increased mRNA expression of LNPEP in severe pre-eclampsia cases, which may be a compensatory response to decreased enzymatic activity affecting blood pressure regulation (Yong2014Increased).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LNPEP is involved in a signaling pathway that affects tumor cell invasion under hypoxic conditions. The circ-LNPEP/miR-532-3p/RAB9A axis is crucial in this process, with alterations in circ-LNPEP expression linked to increased invasiveness of HCC cells (Ouyang2021Loss).

LNPEP's role in the renin-angiotensin system also suggests its involvement in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, as it influences inflammation and antigen presentation (Paladini2020The).

## Interactions
LNPEP, also known as leucyl and cystinyl aminopeptidase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in peptide processing. It is part of the 'Oxytocinase subfamily' of the M1 family of aminopeptidases, which includes P-LAP, A-LAP, and L-RAP, and is located on chromosome 5q15 (Ebstein2012The). LNPEP acts as the receptor for angiotensin IV, facilitating memory retention and retrieval, and is involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), impacting blood pressure regulation and neuroprotection (Paladini2020The; Ebstein2012The). 

The enzyme is translocated from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane in a stimulus-dependent manner, enhancing the cleavage of peptide hormone substrates (Ebstein2012The). In neuronal cells, LNPEP, also known as P-LAP, is associated with membrane fractions and is translocated to the cell surface plasma membrane upon certain treatments, indicating its role in regulating neuronal cell functions (Matsumoto2001Expression). 

LNPEP's interactions with angiotensin IV and its role in the RAS suggest its involvement in various physiological processes, including blood flow regulation and memory consolidation (Paladini2020The). These interactions highlight LNPEP's multifaceted role in both peptide metabolism and broader physiological functions.
