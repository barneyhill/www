# FCRL5

## Overview
FCRL5, or Fc receptor-like 5, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the Fc receptor-like (FCRL) family. The protein, also referred to as FCRL5, is predominantly expressed on B cells, including naive, memory, and plasma cells, and plays a critical role in modulating B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It functions as an inhibitory coreceptor, containing both immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) and inhibitory motifs (ITIM) within its cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its dual regulatory capacity. FCRL5's ability to bind immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies further implicates it in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in mucosal immunity. The gene's expression is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, and its dysregulation has been linked to autoimmune disorders and B cell malignancies, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tolnay2021Lymphocytes; Haga2007Fc; Davis2007Fc).

## Structure
FCRL5 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the Fc receptor-like (FCRL) family. It is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes nine immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Haga2007Fc). The extracellular domains of FCRL5 are composed of five different Ig domain subtypes, arranged in a tandem order from membrane-distal to membrane-proximal (Davis2007Fc). These domains suggest potential Ig binding, although definitive biochemical evidence is lacking (Davis2007Fc).

The cytoplasmic tail of FCRL5 contains both immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) and inhibitory motifs (ITIM), which are crucial for its signaling functions (Davis2007Fc). The presence of these motifs indicates a dual regulatory potential, allowing FCRL5 to modulate B cell receptor signaling through the recruitment of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase (Haga2007Fc).

FCRL5 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including both transmembrane and soluble forms (Haga2007Fc). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are predicted due to the presence of N-linked glycosylation sites (Davis2007Fc).

## Function
FCRL5 (Fc receptor-like 5) is a transmembrane protein expressed on B cells, including naive, memory, and plasma cells. It plays a crucial role in modulating B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by acting as an inhibitory coreceptor. FCRL5 contains both an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic region. When phosphorylated, FCRL5 recruits SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), which dephosphorylates ITAM-based tyrosines in BCR Igα/Igβ heterodimers, thereby inhibiting BCR-mediated signaling (Haga2007Fc).

FCRL5 also binds immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, engaging both the Fc and F(ab')2 parts of the antibody, which allows it to sense various attributes of IgG, such as deamidation and glycosylation. This binding mechanism suggests a role in regulating immune responses, particularly in mucosal immunity, by modulating B cell activity in response to chronic antigen presence (Tolnay2021Lymphocytes).

FCRL5's expression and function suggest it plays a significant role in maintaining the balance between activating and inhibitory signals in B cells, crucial for proper immune function and preventing overactivation that could lead to autoimmunity (Haga2007Fc).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCRL5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and B cell malignancies. Upregulation of FCRL5 is associated with the disruption of B cell anergy, a mechanism crucial for maintaining immune tolerance. This disruption can lead to the activation of autoreactive B cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, and Hashimoto's disease (Ono2023Upregulated). In transgenic mouse models, overexpression of FCRL5 has been shown to exacerbate autoimmune symptoms, including increased production of autoantibodies and enhanced TLR7/9 signaling, which are implicated in lupus-like disease (Ono2023Upregulated).

In the context of B cell malignancies, FCRL5 expression is notably upregulated in conditions such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma. This upregulation is often associated with chromosome 1q21 translocation and correlates with tumor burden, suggesting a role in disease progression (Haga2007Fc; Davis2020Roles). FCRL5 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target, with strategies including monoclonal antibody drug conjugates and T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies showing promise in preclinical studies (Davis2020Roles).

## Interactions
FCRL5 interacts with several proteins that influence B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It contains both immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) and ITAM-like sequences, which mediate its dual regulatory role. The ITIM sequence (Y566) recruits the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase, which inhibits BCR-induced signaling pathways, including tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization (Haga2007Fc; Zhu2013FCRL5). SHP-1's binding to FCRL5 is crucial for its inhibitory effects, particularly in marginal zone (MZ) B cells, where it dampens BCR activation (Zhu2013FCRL5).

Conversely, the ITAM-like sequence (Y543/Y556) associates with the Lyn kinase, promoting activation. Lyn's interaction with FCRL5 is primarily through the ITAM-like Y543 residue, enhancing BCR signaling in certain contexts (Zhu2013FCRL5). This dual functionality allows FCRL5 to modulate BCR signaling in a compartment-specific manner, affecting MZ B cells differently from B1 B cells (Zhu2013FCRL5). These interactions highlight FCRL5's role as a sensor for SHP-1 and Lyn, balancing inhibitory and activating signals in B cells (Zhu2013FCRL5).
