# DCAF10

## Overview
DCAF10 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 10) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and homeostasis. The protein, also known as WDR32, functions as an adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for regulating various cellular activities, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle progression. DCAF10 is particularly active in the nucleus and is highly expressed in testicular tissues, indicating a significant role in spermatogenesis. Its interactions with viral proteins and other components of the ubiquitin ligase complex underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and influencing immune responses (Mistry2020Expression; Yan2017Integrative; Zemke2020Adenovirus).

## Function
DCAF10 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 10) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for regulating protein degradation. This protein functions as an adaptor, linking specific substrates to the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation (Yan2017Integrative).

In healthy human cells, DCAF10 is active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes by targeting proteins for ubiquitination. This activity is vital for the regulation of cellular processes such as DNA damage response and chromatin remodeling, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell function (Mistry2020Expression). The expression of DCAF10 is particularly high in the testis, suggesting a significant role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development (Mistry2020Expression). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in both cellular and organismal biology, contributing to the regulation of testicular development and potentially influencing fertility (Mistry2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
DCAF10 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer. Alterations in the expression of DCAF10 have been associated with improved survival rates in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting a potential protective role in this disease (Maioru2023Developments). The gene's involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which regulates protein degradation, indicates that changes in its expression or function could impact cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, potentially contributing to oncogenesis.

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), DCAF10 is stabilized by the deubiquitinase OTUD1, which cleaves K48-linked ubiquitin chains. This stabilization is part of a mechanism that promotes apoptosis, highlighting DCAF10's role in tumor suppression and its potential impact on chemoresistance (Luo2021OTUD1). While specific diseases directly caused by mutations in DCAF10 are not detailed, its interactions and expression levels are crucial in modulating cancer-related pathways. The gene's expression patterns, particularly its high expression in testicular tissues, suggest it may also play a role in testicular development and spermatogenesis, although specific conditions related to these functions are not explicitly mentioned (Mistry2020Expression).

## Interactions
DCAF10, also known as WDR32, is a protein that interacts with various components of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, including DDB1 and CUL4A/B, to regulate protein stability through ubiquitination. It acts as a substrate receptor within this complex, facilitating the degradation of specific proteins. DCAF10 binds to the adenovirus E1A protein, promoting the assembly of the CRL4 complex, which targets proteins such as RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 for degradation. This interaction is crucial for destabilizing E1A and regulating the stability of IRF3, a transcription factor involved in innate immunity, although IRF3 does not directly interact with DCAF10 (Zemke2020Adenovirus).

DCAF10's interaction with E1A is dependent on the phosphorylation of E1A, which may create a 'phospho-degron' necessary for DCAF10 binding and subsequent protein polyubiquitination and degradation (Zemke2020Adenovirus). Additionally, DCAF10 interacts with HUWE1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, although this interaction is reduced in the presence of E1A, possibly due to enhanced degradation (Zemke2020Adenovirus). DCAF10 does not have direct interactions with nucleic acids, as its primary role is in protein-protein interactions within the ubiquitin ligase complex (Zemke2020Adenovirus).
