# CAPS

## Overview
Calcyphosine (CAPS) is a gene that encodes the calcium-binding protein calcyphosine, which is characterized by its EF-hand domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind calcium ions, a function that is integral to its role in cellular processes such as mitosis. Calcyphosine is primarily involved in spindle formation and function, where it associates with microtubules to facilitate chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein's interaction with tubulin and other spindle-associated proteins underscores its importance in maintaining spindle integrity and proper mitotic progression (Setu2023Calcyphosine). Beyond its cellular functions, CAPS has clinical significance, particularly in oncology, where its expression levels have been linked to prognosis and treatment resistance in various cancers, including colorectal, endometrial, and breast cancers (Xu2016Abnormal; Johansson2015Proteomics; Li2008Prognostic).

## Structure
Calcyphosine (CAPS) is a calcium-binding protein characterized by its EF-hand domains, which are common motifs in calcium-binding proteins. CAPS contains four EF-hand domains, which facilitate its ability to bind calcium ions (Xu2016Abnormal; Kawasaki1998ClassificationandevolutionofEFhandproteins). The protein's structure is highly conserved, suggesting a significant role in cellular processes that require calcium signaling (Setu2023Calcyphosine).

The primary structure of CAPS consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of EF-hand proteins, which contribute to the protein's ability to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding (Kawasaki1998ClassificationandevolutionofEFhandproteins).

CAPS can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A, which is upregulated by cAMP and thyrotropin. This modification plays a role in cell proliferation and maintaining the differentiated phenotype of thyrocytes (Xu2016Abnormal). The protein's tertiary structure, while not detailed in the context, is likely stabilized by interactions typical of calcium-binding proteins, allowing it to interact with other cellular components effectively. CAPS does not appear to have a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits, as no such information is provided in the context.

## Function
Calcyphosine (CAPS) is a calcium-binding protein that plays a critical role in spindle formation and function during mitosis. It is associated with microtubules and is essential for the creation of kinetochore fibers, which are necessary for chromosome segregation. CAPS binds to tubulin in a calcium-dependent manner, promoting microtubule bundling, particularly in forming thick kinetochore fibers, which are vital for spindle integrity (Setu2023Calcyphosine). 

In healthy human cells, CAPS localizes specifically to the central microtubules of the mitotic spindle, including bipolar microtubules and kinetochore fibers, but not to astral microtubules. This specific localization suggests its involvement in spindle assembly or stability (Setu2023Calcyphosine). Knockdown of CAPS results in mitotic defects such as uncongressed chromosomes, multi-polar spindles, and increased apoptosis, indicating its importance in maintaining proper mitotic function (Setu2023Calcyphosine).

CAPS is necessary for chromosome congression and progression through mitosis by promoting the bundling of microtubules to form k-fibers, which are essential for chromosome attachment (Setu2023Calcyphosine). Despite its high expression in various cancers, CAPS overexpression does not significantly affect the cell cycle, suggesting that its elevated levels in cancer may be a consequence rather than a cause of increased cell proliferation (Setu2023Calcyphosine).

## Clinical Significance
Calcyphosine (CAPS) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CAPS overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to clinicopathological factors such as histological grade, invasive depth, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. High CAPS expression correlates with reduced survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in CRC (Xu2016Abnormal).

In endometrial cancer (EC), CAPS is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with a low degree of differentiation and poor survival outcomes, establishing CAPS as an independent prognostic factor for EC patients (Li2008Prognostic).

CAPS is also linked to tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. High CAPS levels are associated with lower relapse-free survival, indicating its role in tamoxifen resistance and potential as a predictive marker for treatment outcomes (Johansson2015Proteomics).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CAPS overexpression is associated with greater tumor invasion depth and higher histological grade, correlating with poorer overall survival. This suggests CAPS as a prognostic biomarker in ESCC (Li2017Overexpression).

## Interactions
Calcyphosine (CAPS) is a calcium-binding protein that interacts with several other proteins, primarily through its association with microtubules during mitosis. CAPS binds to tubulin in a calcium-dependent manner, facilitating its role in spindle formation and function. This interaction is crucial for the bundling of microtubules to form kinetochore fibers, which are essential for chromosome segregation during cell division (Setu2023Calcyphosine).

CAPS is also suggested to interact with the zinc-finger protein ZC2HC1A and the microtubule spindle-associated protein HURP. These interactions may form part of a complex that influences microtubule bundling and spindle stability (Setu2023Calcyphosine). In vitro studies have shown that CAPS can induce microtubule bundling independently, indicating an intrinsic ability to crosslink microtubules (Setu2023Calcyphosine).

In the context of cancer, CAPS has been identified as a potential predictive marker for tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It may serve as an alternative calcium signaling route to calmodulin, suggesting a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways (Johansson2015Proteomics). These interactions highlight CAPS's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential impact on disease states.
