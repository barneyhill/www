# KBTBD3

## Overview
KBTBD3 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 3, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of kelch repeats and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. These structural motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that KBTBD3 may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. Although the precise biological functions of the KBTBD3 protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular pathways and has been associated with certain genetic conditions. Research has identified potential links between KBTBD3 and neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although the exact mechanisms and significance of these associations remain to be fully understood (Almeida2024Molecular; Vadgama2019De). Further studies are necessary to explore the functional roles of KBTBD3 and its potential impact on human health.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the KBTBD3 gene is not fully detailed in the available literature. However, research has identified nonsynonymous variants in KBTBD3 in a twin pair discordant for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These variants were found in the unaffected twin, suggesting a potential protective effect rather than a direct link to disease manifestation (Vadgama2019De). The study highlights the complexity of interpreting genetic variants, as the presence of KBTBD3 mutations in the unaffected twin implies that these variants might not be pathogenic or could interact with other genetic or environmental factors to influence disease outcomes (Vadgama2019De).

While KBTBD3 is mentioned in a list of genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through whole exome sequencing, the specific clinical significance or role of KBTBD3 mutations in ASD is not elaborated upon (Almeida2024Molecular). The current understanding of KBTBD3's involvement in disease is limited, and further research is needed to clarify its role and potential impact on human health. The gene's interactions and expression levels may contribute to various conditions, but definitive associations remain to be established.
