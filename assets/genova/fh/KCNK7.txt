# KCNK7

## Overview
KCNK7 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K member 7, which is part of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. These channels are integral membrane proteins characterized by their role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating electrical excitability in cells. KCNK7, however, is unique among its family members as it does not independently form functional ion channels, suggesting it may require additional subunits or regulatory proteins for activity (Lesage2000Molecular; Goldstein2001Potassium). The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the spinal cord and cerebellum, hinting at a potential role in neural functions (Medhurst2001Distribution). Despite its structural similarities to other K2P channels, KCNK7's specific physiological roles and mechanisms remain largely unexplored, with ongoing research investigating its potential involvement in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Williams2013Altered; Zou2022Integrative).

## Structure
KCNK7 is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, characterized by having two pore-forming P domains and four transmembrane segments. The protein forms dimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Lesage2000Molecular; Tian2013Potassium). KCNK7 is closely related to KCNK6, sharing 94% sequence homology, but it lacks the EF-hand motif present in KCNK6 (Lesage2000Molecular). 

A unique feature of KCNK7 is the presence of an unusual sequence in its second pore domain, where a glutamic residue (GLE) replaces the strictly conserved glycine residue (GLG) found in other K2P channels. This unusual sequence could be associated with a change in ionic selectivity (Lesage2000Molecular). KCNK7 also contains four potential SH3-binding motifs in the C-terminal domain of each subunit (Plant2023TwoPoreDomain).

Despite reaching the plasma membrane, KCNK7 remains non-functional on its own and may require association with other subunits or regulatory proteins to form functional channels (Lesage2000Molecular; Goldstein2001Potassium). The protein's functionality might be influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not well-documented (Tian2013Potassium).

## Function
KCNK7 is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating electrical excitability in cells. Despite its structural similarity to other functional K2P channels, KCNK7 has not been shown to generate ion currents in heterologous systems, such as COS-7 cells, suggesting it may require additional factors or partner proteins to become functional (Salinas1999Cloning; Enyedi2010Molecular). The channel's unique pore structure, with a GLE sequence instead of the typical GYG sequence, may affect its ability to form a selectivity filter, which is crucial for potassium ion conduction (Salinas1999Cloning).

KCNK7 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and cerebellum, indicating a potential role in CNS functions (Medhurst2001Distribution). However, its specific function in healthy human cells remains unclear, as studies have not demonstrated its activity as a potassium channel. It is hypothesized that KCNK7 might require an unidentified accessory subunit or regulatory influence to become functional (Goldstein2001Potassium).

## Clinical Significance
The KCNK7 gene, a member of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, has been implicated in various cancer types due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, KCNK7 expression is associated with better overall survival, suggesting a potential protective role. However, its expression is negatively correlated with disease-free survival and CD8+ T cell levels in the tumor microenvironment, indicating a complex involvement in immune response modulation (Zou2022Integrative). 

In other cancers, KCNK7 is significantly underexpressed, particularly in melanoma and cervical cancers, where it ranks among the top 1% of underexpressed genes (Williams2013Altered). In cervical squamous cell carcinoma, KCNK7 shows a significant down-regulation, while in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, its decreased expression is not significant (Williams2013Altered). 

Despite these associations, the specific diseases or conditions directly linked to KCNK7 mutations or expression changes are not well-documented. Studies have not reported significant cardiac or neurological conditions associated with KCNK7, as knockout models in mice did not show altered sensitivity to anesthetics or significant phenotypic changes (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain; Yost2008Knockout).
