# SPART

## Overview
The SPART gene encodes the spartin protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. Spartin is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases to lipid droplets, thereby facilitating their turnover and degradation through lipophagy (Chung2021The; Hooper2010Spartin). It also plays a critical role in cytokinesis by interacting with the ESCRT-III protein Ist1, which is essential for its recruitment to midbodies (Renvoisé2010SPG20). Mutations in the SPART gene are associated with Troyer syndrome, a hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by neurological and developmental impairments, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Diquigiovanni2018In; Diquigiovanni2019A).

## Structure
The SPART gene encodes the spartin protein, which is characterized by several distinct domains. Spartin contains an N-terminal microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain, a central PPxY motif, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function (Eastman2009A). The MIT domain is crucial for interactions with the ESCRT-III protein Ist1, which is important for spartin's recruitment to midbodies during cytokinesis (Renvoisé2010SPG20). The PPxY motif is essential for binding to the WW domains of HECT ubiquitin ligases, such as WWP1, facilitating spartin's role in lipid droplet turnover (Eastman2009A).

Spartin is also involved in selective autophagy of lipid droplets, known as lipophagy, where it acts as a receptor that interacts with core autophagy machinery. This interaction is mediated by the ubiquitin-binding region (UBR) domain, which is necessary for spartin's association with autophagy-related proteins like LC3A and LC3C (Chung2021The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including monoubiquitination, which may influence its localization and function (Eastman2009A). Spartin's structure includes amphipathic helices (AHs) that facilitate its binding to lipid droplet surfaces (Chung2021The).

## Function
The SPART gene encodes the spartin protein, which plays a crucial role in several cellular processes. Spartin is involved in the selective autophagy of lipid droplets, a process known as lipophagy, which is essential for lipid mobilization and energy homeostasis. It acts as a receptor that localizes to lipid droplets and interacts with the core autophagy machinery, facilitating the delivery of lipid droplets to lysosomes for degradation (Chung2021The). Spartin also functions as an adaptor protein, recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases such as AIP4 to lipid droplets, enhancing their enzymatic activity and promoting the ubiquitination of lipid droplet-associated proteins like adipophilin, which is then degraded via a proteasome-dependent pathway (Hooper2010Spartin).

In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, spartin is associated with mitochondrial function. It is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with cardiolipin, a major phospholipid, playing a role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium homeostasis (Joshi2011SPG20). Spartin's involvement in these processes is critical for proper mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Joshi2011SPG20).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPART gene, which encodes the protein spartin, are linked to Troyer syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, distal atrophy, short stature, cognitive defects, and neurodevelopmental delays. The c.892dupA mutation in SPART leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon, resulting in a loss of function of the spartin protein. This mutation causes mitochondrial dysfunction, including impaired Complex I activity, reduced ATP synthesis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and altered pyruvate metabolism (Diquigiovanni2018In; Diquigiovanni2019A).

The loss of spartin affects mitochondrial dynamics, leading to fragmented and disorganized mitochondrial networks with decreased interconnectivity. This disruption contributes to neurodegenerative processes, as neurons with long axons are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial alterations (Diquigiovanni2018In; Diquigiovanni2019A). The mutation also results in increased oxidative stress and altered intracellular calcium homeostasis, further exacerbating neuronal damage (Diquigiovanni2019A).

These mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunctions are proposed to contribute to the neurological impairments observed in Troyer syndrome and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of SPART gene mutations (Diquigiovanni2018In; Diquigiovanni2019A).

## Interactions
Spartin, encoded by the SPART gene, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. Spartin interacts with components of the autophagy machinery, specifically LC3A and LC3C proteins, through its ubiquitin-binding region (UBR domain). This interaction is essential for spartin's role in lipophagy, facilitating the delivery of lipid droplets (LDs) to lysosomes for degradation (Chung2021The).

Spartin also interacts with the ESCRT-III protein Ist1, which is important for its recruitment to midbodies during cytokinesis. This interaction is mediated by spartin's MIT domain and is crucial for successful cytokinesis, particularly the abscission phase (Renvoisé2010SPG20).

Additionally, spartin binds to HECT ubiquitin ligases, such as WWP1, through its PPxY motif. This interaction regulates lipid droplet turnover by facilitating ubiquitin transfer, which removes spartin from lipid droplets and reduces its levels. Spartin can also bind to other HECT ubiquitin ligases like WWP2, Itch, Smurf1, and Smurf2 (Eastman2009A). These interactions highlight spartin's role in lipid metabolism and cellular division processes.
