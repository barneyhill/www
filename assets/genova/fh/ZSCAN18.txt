# ZSCAN18

## Overview
ZSCAN18 is a human gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 18, which is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger motifs enable the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences, while the SCAN domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, allowing ZSCAN18 to form complexes with other proteins. These interactions suggest a role in chromatin-based mechanisms, potentially influencing gene expression, chromosome organization, and histone modification (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). ZSCAN18 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression is often altered, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor and a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Wang2023Zinc; Li2023Inactivation).

## Function
ZSCAN18 is a human gene encoding a protein that contains both zinc finger and SCAN domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in various nuclear processes, including transcription and DNA binding (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). The SCAN domain of ZSCAN18 facilitates protein-protein interactions, allowing it to interact with other SCAN-domain proteins such as SCAND1 and ZKSCAN1, suggesting a role in forming protein complexes that may influence transcriptional regulation (Schmitges2016Multiparameter).

ZSCAN18 is part of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which is the largest class of human transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their highly variable C2H2-ZF arrays, resulting in unique DNA binding motifs that contribute to their functional diversity (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). The interactions and binding patterns of ZSCAN18 suggest it may be involved in chromatin-based mechanisms, potentially influencing gene expression regulation, chromosome organization, and histone modification (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). The protein's interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 indicate a possible role in protein degradation pathways, which could be crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Schmitges2016Multiparameter).

## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN18 has been implicated in various cancers, primarily due to alterations in its expression and promoter methylation. In gastric cancer (GC), ZSCAN18 is significantly downregulated, largely due to promoter hypermethylation, which is not observed in normal gastric tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor survival outcomes in GC patients, suggesting that ZSCAN18 could serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis. Overexpression of ZSCAN18 inhibits GC cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating its tumor-suppressive function. The gene regulates TP53INP2, a gene involved in autophagy, and its effects are mediated through TP53INP2-mediated autophagy (Li2023Inactivation).

In breast cancer (BC), ZSCAN18 is also downregulated, particularly in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. High ZSCAN18 expression is associated with improved overall survival and relapse-free survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression is negatively correlated with certain clinicopathological parameters, such as HER2 status and tumor stage. Promoter methylation of ZSCAN18 is significantly higher in BC tissues, correlating with lower mRNA expression (Wang2023Zinc).

In colorectal cancer, ZSCAN18 is frequently hypermethylated, which is associated with reduced gene expression. This methylation is linked to BRAF exon 15 mutation and microsatellite instability status, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Marie2014The).

## Interactions
ZSCAN18, a zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing protein, participates in various protein-protein interactions. The SCAN domain of ZSCAN18 facilitates oligomerization, allowing it to self-associate or interact with other SCAN domain-containing proteins. Large-scale protein-protein interaction studies have identified that ZSCAN18 interacts specifically with several other zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) that contain SCAN domains, such as ZSCAN20 (delahaye2018characterisation). 

In breast cancer, ZSCAN18 forms a physical complex with ZNF396 and PGBD1, as identified through protein-protein interaction network analyses (Wang2023Zinc). This interaction suggests a potential role in transcriptional regulation and intracellular processes. Additionally, ZSCAN18 is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to promoter regions, as demonstrated in gastric cancer where it binds to the promoter of TP53INP2, influencing autophagy-related pathways (Li2023Inactivation).

These interactions highlight ZSCAN18's role in forming multiprotein complexes and regulating gene expression, which may contribute to its function as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. The SCAN domain's ability to mediate protein dimerization is crucial for these interactions, supporting ZSCAN18's involvement in complex regulatory networks.
