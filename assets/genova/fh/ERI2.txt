# ERI2

## Overview
ERI2 (exoribonuclease family member 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the critical biological process of RNA processing and degradation. The protein produced by ERI2 is categorized as an exoribonuclease, which plays a significant role in maintaining RNA stability and turnover within the cell. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating gene expression by ensuring that RNA molecules are available in appropriate quantities and are efficiently degraded when they are no longer needed. The ERI2 protein primarily operates in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular processes by modulating RNA levels, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis. Proper functioning of ERI2 is essential for maintaining cellular health, as disruptions in RNA stability can lead to imbalances in gene expression and potentially result in disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
ERI2 (ERI1 exoribonuclease family member 2) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing and degradation. This protein functions as an exoribonuclease, which is essential for the regulation of RNA stability and turnover. By participating in the degradation of specific RNA molecules, ERI2 helps maintain RNA homeostasis, a critical aspect of proper gene expression and cellular function. The activity of ERI2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular processes by modulating the levels of RNA available for translation and other cellular activities. Through its role in RNA degradation, ERI2 contributes to the fine-tuning of gene expression, ensuring that RNA molecules are present in appropriate amounts and are degraded when no longer needed. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular health and function, as imbalances in RNA stability can lead to disrupted cellular processes and potentially contribute to disease states. The precise control of RNA turnover by ERI2 underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and the broader organismal outcomes that depend on tightly regulated gene expression.
