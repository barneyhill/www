# CPA5

## Overview
The CPA5 gene encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase A5, which is a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase family. This family of enzymes is characterized by their ability to cleave amino acids from the carboxy-terminal end of proteins and peptides, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including digestion and protein maturation. Carboxypeptidase A5 is a zinc-dependent enzyme, which categorizes it as a metalloenzyme, and it is involved in the processing of prohormones and other peptide substrates. The expression and activity of CPA5 can have significant implications in metabolic pathways and are of interest in the study of certain diseases due to their potential role in the regulation of peptide hormones and other bioactive peptides (Qiu2020aarFDC).
