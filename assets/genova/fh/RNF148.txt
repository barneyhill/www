# RNF148

## Overview
RNF148 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 148, which is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain, the latter of which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Nakamura2011The; Cabana2022From). E3 ubiquitin ligases play a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a system essential for protein degradation and regulation within the cell (Nakamura2011The). RNF148 is predominantly expressed in the interstitial cells of the human testis and to a lesser extent in the pancreas, with its expression being modulated by histone acetylation (Liu2013Identification). The protein's involvement in the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein CHAC2 suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, such as gastric and colorectal cancers (Liu2017CHAC2).

## Structure
RNF148 is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of proteins, characterized by the presence of a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain. The RING-H2 finger domain is notable for its role in coordinating zinc ions, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The; Cabana2022From). The PA domain is proposed to act as a protein-protein interaction module, aiding in the recognition and binding of substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The).

RNF148 is primarily expressed in the interstitial cells of human testicular tissues and is slightly expressed in the pancreas. Its expression is regulated by histone deacetylases, with increased expression upon treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors, indicating a mechanism of epigenetic regulation (Liu2013Identification). The protein is expressed as a 30-kDa product in human testes (Liu2013Identification). While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RNF148 are not provided, it is suggested that the ectodomains of the Goliath family E3 ligases, including RNF148, have related folds for ligand recognition (Peng2013Structures).

## Function
RNF148 is a gene encoding a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway is crucial for protein degradation, a process that regulates protein stability, trafficking, and activity within the cell (Nakamura2011The). The RNF148 protein contains a RING-H2 finger domain, a characteristic feature of many E3 ubiquitin ligases, which facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The; Liu2017CHAC2). 

RNF148 is predominantly expressed in the interstitial cells of the human testis and is slightly expressed in the pancreas (Liu2013Identification). Its expression is regulated by histone acetylation, as treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors like Trichostatin A increases RNF148 expression, suggesting that chromatin structure and DNA accessibility play roles in its regulation (Liu2013Identification). 

In the context of cancer, RNF148 has been identified as a potential specific ubiquitin ligase for CHAC2, a tumor suppressor protein. RNF148 may contribute to the degradation of CHAC2, implicating it in the development of gastric and colorectal cancers (Liu2017CHAC2).
