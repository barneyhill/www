# SPAG8

## Overview
The SPAG8 gene encodes the sperm-associated antigen 8 protein, which is primarily involved in the process of spermatogenesis. This protein is testis-specific and plays a significant role in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the G2/M phase, by interacting with microtubules. SPAG8 is crucial for the proper development of sperm cells, as it modulates cell division and enhances the transcriptional activation of genes necessary for spermatogenesis. The protein interacts with the activator of CREM in testis (ACT), facilitating the expression of post-meiotic genes. SPAG8's localization in various cellular compartments during different stages of sperm cell development underscores its stage-specific functions. Its interactions and regulatory mechanisms are essential for normal male fertility (Li2009Regulation; SánchezJasso2023Novel; Wu2010Sperm).

## Function
The SPAG8 gene encodes the sperm-associated antigen 8 protein, which plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. SPAG8 is testis-specific and is expressed during male germ cell differentiation. It is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly the G2/M phase, by interacting with microtubules. In CHO-K1 cells, SPAG8 localizes at the microtubule-organizing center during prophase, co-localizes with a-tubulin on the spindle during metaphase, and is present on astral microtubules and the mid-zone during anaphase. This localization suggests its involvement in cell division by modulating cell cycle progression (Li2009Regulation).

SPAG8 also interacts with the activator of CREM in testis (ACT), enhancing the transcriptional activation of ACT-mediated CREMs, which are crucial for the expression of post-meiotic genes essential for normal spermatogenesis. This interaction supports the binding of ACT to CREMs, increasing the transcriptional activity of CREMτ, independent of CREMτ S117 phosphorylation. SPAG8 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids, and in the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids, indicating its stage-specific function during spermatogenesis (SánchezJasso2023Novel; Wu2010Sperm).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SPAG8 (sperm associated antigen 8) is known to interact with the activator of CREM in testis (ACT), playing a significant role in spermatogenesis. This interaction is crucial for enhancing the transcriptional activation of CREMτ-mediated genes, which are essential for normal spermatogenesis. SPAG8 and ACT show a coupled intercellular localization in male germ cells, and their interaction has been confirmed through various assays, including yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays (SánchezJasso2023Novel; Wu2010Sperm).

SPAG8 interacts with ACT through two specific domains within its structure, while the second LIM domain of ACT is essential for this interaction. This interaction supports the binding of ACT to CREMτ, enhancing its transcriptional activity without forming a SPAG8-ACT-CREMτ complex. The interaction is independent of CREMτ S117 phosphorylation, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism (SánchezJasso2023Novel; Wu2010Sperm).

SPAG8 is also involved in the microtubule-dependent nuclear transport of ACT, facilitating its translocation into the nucleus in round spermatids. This mechanism is similar to the nuclear transport of ACT by KIF17b, although the exact details of SPAG8's role remain to be fully elucidated (SánchezJasso2023Novel).
