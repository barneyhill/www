# XRRA1

## Overview
The XRRA1 gene encodes the X-ray radiation resistance associated 1 protein, which is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly from X-ray radiation. This protein is characterized by structural motifs such as leucine-rich repeats (LRR), PEST sequences, and nuclear localization signals (NLS), which suggest roles in protein-protein interactions, rapid degradation, and cellular signaling. Although the XRRA1 protein is not exclusively nuclear, it exhibits a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution, indicating its involvement in both nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. Functionally, XRRA1 is implicated in DNA repair pathways, including the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is crucial for repairing DNA double-strand breaks and maintaining genomic stability. The gene's expression is observed in various tissues and is notably active in the testis, prostate, and ovary, as well as in several cancer types, where it may influence treatment resistance (Mesak2003Molecular).

## Structure
The XRRA1 gene encodes a protein consisting of 559 amino acids, featuring several notable structural motifs. The primary structure includes two leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sites located at amino acids 20-41 and 138-164, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Mesak2003Molecular). The protein also contains a PEST sequence from amino acids 247-264, which is often associated with rapid degradation (Mesak2003Molecular). Additionally, there are two tyrosine phosphorylation sites at amino acids 81 and 142, suggesting a role in signal transduction (Mesak2003Molecular).

The XRRA1 protein includes bipartite nuclear targeting sequences at amino acids 357-373 and 485-501, indicating potential nuclear localization, although the protein is not exclusively nuclear, as it shows nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution (Mesak2003Molecular). The presence of these motifs suggests involvement in cellular processes such as signal transduction and nuclear transport (Mesak2003Molecular).

The XRRA1 gene also exhibits splice variants, including one that lacks exon three and ends on exon four, which may influence the protein's function and stability (Mesak2003Molecular). The conservation of these motifs across several mammals indicates a fundamental role in cellular functions (Mesak2003Molecular).

## Function
The XRRA1 gene encodes a protein involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly from X-ray radiation. This protein plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes, contributing to genomic stability by regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Hall2018Unfolding; Mesak2003Molecular). XRRA1 is expressed in various tissues, including normal proliferative cells and cancer cells, and is notably active in the testis, prostate, and ovary (Mesak2003Molecular).

The XRRA1 protein contains motifs such as leucine-rich repeats (LRR), PEST sequences, and nuclear localization signals (NLS), which suggest roles in protein interaction, rapid degradation, and cellular signaling (Mesak2003Molecular). Despite the presence of an NLS, XRRA1 is not exclusively located in the nucleus, as it has been observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Mesak2003Molecular). The protein's involvement in DNA repair is linked to its potential role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which repairs DNA double-strand breaks (Mesak2003Molecular). XRRA1's function in these processes is essential for maintaining cell viability and preventing mutations, thereby influencing cellular responses to radiation in both tumor and normal cells (Mesak2003Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The XRRA1 gene is implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and treatment resistance. Alterations in XRRA1 expression have been associated with cancer development and progression, as it is expressed in numerous tumor types, including colorectal, breast, brain, prostate, pancreas, and ovarian cancers (Mesak2003Molecular). The gene's involvement in DNA damage response pathways, such as the ATM/CHK1/2 pathway, suggests that changes in XRRA1 expression or function could impact the resistance of cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Abad2020DNA).

In colorectal cancer, XRRA1 expression is modulated by X-ray treatment, indicating its role in radioresistance or radiosensitivity (Mesak2003Molecular). The gene's expression is also linked to glucocorticoid resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, suggesting a role in steroid resistance (Bergeron2022Epigenomic). Additionally, XRRA1 has been identified in genomic studies as part of amplified regions in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in the cancer's genomic landscape (Erkizan2021Exome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of XRRA1 in cancer biology and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
The XRRA1 protein is involved in several interactions that suggest its role in cellular responses to DNA damage and cancer development. It is known to interact with the DNA repair pathway, particularly affecting the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Overexpression of XRRA1 in COS-7 cells has been shown to result in the absence of Ku86, a key DNA repair molecule, from the nucleus, indicating a potential interaction or interference with the DNA repair process involving Ku86 (Mesak2003Molecular).

XRRA1 contains conserved motifs such as leucine-rich repeats (LRR), PEST sequences, nuclear localization signals (NLS), and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which suggest potential interactions with other proteins and involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Mesak2003Molecular). The presence of these motifs indicates that XRRA1 may participate in dynamic interactions with other proteins, possibly influencing its nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution and rapid degradation via the proteasomal pathway (Mesak2003Molecular).

Additionally, XRRA1 expression is modulated by transcription factors such as C/EBPα, HSF-1, c-Jun, c-Fos, AP-1, and CREB, which are part of the bZIP superfamily, further suggesting its involvement in complex regulatory networks (Mesak2003Molecular).
