# OR6C65

## Overview
OR6C65 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 65, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR6C65, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating a neuronal response upon binding specific odorants. The gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the complex process of olfactory signal transduction. While primarily associated with olfactory function, OR6C65 has also been implicated in various medical conditions, highlighting its potential significance beyond olfaction (Hirata2023Exploring; Talli2022Novel; Karoii2024Whole).

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR6C65 has been implicated in several medical conditions through its altered expression or genetic variations. In the context of preeclampsia, OR6C65 is noted for its loss of expression, with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.83, suggesting its potential role in predicting this condition. The study highlights the clinical relevance of OR6C65 in the context of pregnancy-related conditions, particularly preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OR6C65 has been identified in severe sub-phenotypes related to memory and verbal abilities. This suggests a potential link between OR6C65 and the severity of certain ASD symptoms, although further research is needed to confirm its diagnostic role (Talli2022Novel).

Additionally, OR6C65 has been associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), where it was found to be up-regulated in affected individuals. This indicates a possible involvement in the molecular mechanisms underlying NOA, although the clinical significance of this association remains unclear (Karoii2024Whole).

Overall, while OR6C65 is linked to various conditions, the specific clinical implications of its mutations or altered expression require further investigation to establish definitive roles in these diseases.
