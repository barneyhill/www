# STRN3

## Overview
STRN3 is a gene that encodes the protein striatin 3, a scaffolding protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. Striatin 3 is a member of the striatin family and is a key component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which is involved in various signal transduction processes. The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a caveolin-binding region, a coiled-coil domain, a calmodulin-binding region, and a WD40-repeat domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function as a scaffold (Li2023Cellular; Hwang2014STRIPAK). Striatin 3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is involved in critical cellular processes such as the regulation of the cell cycle, modulation of glucocorticoid receptor activity, and interactions with estrogen receptor alpha (Petta2017Glucocorticoid; Tan2008Striatin3γ). Alterations in STRN3 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Tang2020Selective; Li2023Cellular).

## Structure
STRN3, also known as striatin 3, is a protein characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function as a scaffolding protein within the STRIPAK complex. The primary structure of STRN3 includes a caveolin-binding region at the N-terminal, a coiled-coil domain, a calmodulin-binding region, and a C-terminal WD40-repeat domain (Li2023Cellular). The coiled-coil domain is crucial for the dimerization and oligomerization of STRN3, facilitating its role in assembling the STRIPAK complex (Tang2019Architecture; Li2023Cellular). 

The tertiary structure of STRN3 reveals an asymmetric parallel homodimer configuration, with one α-helical chain exhibiting a bend, which is essential for stable complex formation with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Li2023Cellular). The WD40-repeat domain forms a β-propeller structure, providing a platform for protein interactions, including binding with proteins like adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Mob3 (Hwang2014STRIPAK).

STRN3 has multiple isoforms, with some variants lacking the C-terminal WD-repeat domain and being membrane-associated, while others are cytosolic (Li2023Cellular). These structural features and domain interactions are critical for STRN3's role in cellular signaling and its involvement in cancer-related processes (Li2023Cellular).

## Function
STRN3 (striatin 3) functions as a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. This complex is crucial for signal transduction, particularly in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, and involves interactions with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and other kinases (Li2023Cellular). STRN3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is found in the cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus, where it facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes (Li2023Cellular).

In the context of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), STRN3 acts as an inhibitor of GR-mediated transactivation by forming a trimeric complex with GR and PPP2CA, a phosphatase, which leads to the dephosphorylation of GR at serine 211. This interaction is essential for modulating GR's transcriptional activity (Petta2017Glucocorticoid). STRN3 also influences the cell cycle by regulating microtubule dynamics and is associated with the extension of the G2 phase duration when upregulated, while its downregulation can induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Li2023Cellular). These roles highlight STRN3's importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the STRN3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly gastric cancer. Elevated levels of STRN3 are associated with YAP hyperactivation, a factor linked to poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. This hyperactivation results from STRN3's role in the PP2A phosphatase complex, which inactivates the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway, promoting tumorigenesis (Tang2020Selective). Disruption of the STRN3-PP2A interaction can restore Hippo signaling, suppressing YAP activity and inhibiting gastric cancer growth (Tang2020Selective). STRN3 is also involved in the dephosphorylation of MST1/2 kinases, further contributing to the inactivation of the Hippo pathway and enhancing YAP activity, which promotes gastric tumorigenesis (Tang2020Selective).

In breast cancer, STRN3 expression is increased in tumor tissues and is associated with drug response in patients with positive estrogen receptor status. It plays a role in the regulation of ERα trafficking, crucial for breast cancer progression (Li2023Cellular). STRN3's involvement in the STRIPAK complex and its interactions with PP2A suggest its potential role in oncogenic signaling pathways, contributing to cancer development and progression (Li2023Cellular). These findings highlight STRN3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Striatin-3 (STRN3) is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. Within this complex, STRN3 interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), serving as a central scaffold that recruits various components, including STRIP1, MST kinases, and SIKE1. The coiled-coil domain of STRN3 is essential for these interactions, facilitating the recruitment of PP2Aa, STRIP1, and MST kinases, and interacting with the coiled-coil domain of SIKE1 (Tang2019Architecture).

STRN3 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), forming a trimeric complex with GR and PPP2CA, a catalytic subunit of PP2A. This interaction is enhanced by the synthetic GR agonist Dexamethasone and is crucial for the dephosphorylation of GR at serine 211, which affects GR's transcriptional activity. STRN3 inhibits GR-mediated transactivation but does not affect transrepression (Petta2017Glucocorticoid).

Additionally, STRN3 interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) by recruiting PP2A, leading to the dephosphorylation of ERα at specific serine residues, which modulates its transcriptional activity (Tan2008Striatin3γ). These interactions highlight STRN3's role in regulating various signaling pathways through its scaffold function.
