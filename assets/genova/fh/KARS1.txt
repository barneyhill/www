# KARS1

## Overview
KARS1 is a gene that encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase 1, an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis in human cells. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs, a process essential for translating genetic information into functional proteins. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase 1 is unique in that it is produced in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms through alternative splicing, allowing it to function in different cellular compartments (Wang2020Hearing; Lin2021Biallelic). In the cytoplasm, it is a component of the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC), which plays a role in protein synthesis and regulation (Wang2020Hearing). Beyond its primary function, KARS1 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as cancer metastasis (Sung2022Functional; Kim2013Chemical). Mutations in KARS1 are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders and hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance (Lin2021Biallelic; Sun2019Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The KARS1 gene encodes the human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS), a dimeric enzyme involved in protein synthesis. The protein is composed of three domains: the N-terminal domain, the aminoacylation domain, and the anti-codon binding domain. The anti-codon binding domain features an oligomer-binding (OB)-fold motif, characterized by a conserved five-stranded β-barrel connected by several α-helices (Wang2020Hearing).

The primary structure of hLysRS includes specific residues such as Tyr 145 and Asp 349, which are crucial for its structure and function. Tyr 145 is located in the β2 strand of the OB-fold motif, while Asp 349 is situated in the α9 helix, influencing the interface between the aminoacylation and anti-codon binding domains (Wang2020Hearing).

In terms of quaternary structure, hLysRS can form a homodimer and, to a lesser extent, a tetramer in solution. This protein is part of a large complex known as the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC) in the cytoplasm, which includes ten aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities and three non-enzyme co-factors (Wang2020Hearing). The mitochondrial version of LysRS, encoded by the same gene through alternative splicing, has an N-terminal extension that functions as a tRNA Lys binding element (Peng2022RNA).

## Function
The KARS1 gene encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of the amino acid lysine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation, which is crucial for the accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins (Vargas2020Progressive; Sun2019Lossoffunction). KARS1 is unique in that it produces both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial lysyl-tRNA synthetases through alternative splicing, allowing it to function in both cellular compartments (Wang2020Hearing; Lin2021Biallelic).

In the cytoplasm, lysyl-tRNA synthetase is part of a large complex known as the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC), which includes ten aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities and three non-enzyme co-factors. This complex facilitates protein synthesis by channeling aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome and serving as a regulatory hub (Wang2020Hearing). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining cellular integrity and ensuring translational fidelity, impacting overall organismal protein homeostasis (Vargas2020Progressive; Sun2019Lossoffunction). The proper function of KARS1 is essential for normal cellular processes, and any disruption can lead to various diseases, particularly those affecting the nervous system (Lin2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KARS1 gene, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and hearing loss. These mutations can lead to early-onset complex neurological phenotypes, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, nonsyndromic hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, congenital visual impairment, progressive microcephaly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and leukoencephalopathies (Lin2021Biallelic; Sun2019Lossoffunction). 

Patients with biallelic KARS1 variants often exhibit multisystem abnormalities, primarily affecting the nervous system. Common clinical features include moderate-to-severe developmental delay, progressive neurological and neurosensory impairment, and white matter involvement. Additional symptoms may include developmental regression, intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, and extraneurological signs such as feeding difficulties and neonatal vomiting (Lin2021Biallelic). 

Neuroimaging studies have shown a wide spectrum of manifestations, from normal brain appearance to severe leukodystrophy, with some cases presenting with callosal hypoplasia and cerebellar atrophy (Lin2021Biallelic). The KARS1 gene mutations are also linked to mitochondrial disorders, as suggested by the multiorgan dysfunction observed in affected individuals (Lin2021Biallelic). 

In zebrafish models, loss of KARS1 function leads to significant neuromuscular dysfunction, sensorineural hearing loss, and increased seizure activity, mirroring the phenotypes observed in humans (Lin2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
KARS1, also known as lysyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that extend beyond its primary role in protein synthesis. It is a component of the multisynthetase complex (MSC) and interacts with the protein p38 to form an α2β2 heterotetramer. This interaction utilizes the same interface as the LysRS dimer-dimer interaction and does not interfere with the aminoacylation activity of KARS1, indicating that p38 does not compete with tRNA for binding (Guo2008Crystal).

KARS1 also interacts with the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), a process that is crucial for cancer metastasis. Upon phosphorylation at T52 by p38MAPK, KARS1 dissociates from the MSC and translocates to the plasma membrane, where it stabilizes 67LR, enhancing cell migration and metastasis (Sung2022Functional; Kim2013Chemical). The interaction between KARS1 and 67LR can be inhibited by the compound YH16899, which specifically disrupts this interaction without affecting KARS1's catalytic activity (Kim2013Chemical).

KARS1 also interacts with other proteins such as mutant forms of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), HIV-1 Gag protein, and TIP-15. The Gag protein binds to the dimer interface of KARS1, forming a heterodimer that likely affects its interaction with p38 (Guo2008Crystal).
