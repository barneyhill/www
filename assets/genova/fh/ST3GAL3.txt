# ST3GAL3

## Overview
ST3GAL3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3, which is a type II membrane protein localized in the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme plays a critical role in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways (van2018A; Qi2019ST3GAL3). The sialylation activity of ST3GAL3 is particularly important in the brain, where it contributes to neural development, learning, and memory (Khamirani2021Phenotype). Mutations in the ST3GAL3 gene have been linked to several neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Indellicato2019A; Khamirani2021Phenotype). Additionally, alterations in the expression of ST3GAL3 have been associated with cancer progression, indicating its broader impact on human health (Qi2019ST3GAL3).

## Structure
The ST3GAL3 gene encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3, which is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The primary structure of ST3GAL3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The enzyme contains specific domains, including the sialyltransferase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Uslupehlivan2019Computational). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for the function of ST3GAL3. The enzyme is known to undergo mucin-type O-glycosylation, which influences its interaction with other molecules and its stability (Uslupehlivan2019Computational). 

The tertiary structure of ST3GAL3 involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function, although specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The enzyme's activity and function can be affected by genetic variants, such as the p.Y220* mutation, which results in a truncated and inactive protein, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Indellicato2019A). 

Overall, the structure of ST3GAL3 is integral to its role in sialylation, with specific domains and modifications playing key roles in its enzymatic activity.

## Function
The ST3GAL3 gene encodes the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, which is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to galactose residues, forming sialyl Lewis a (sLe a) epitopes, which are crucial for regulating cell-cell interactions, particularly in the developing brain (van2018A; Khamirani2021Phenotype). ST3GAL3 is a Golgi-localized type II membrane protein, characterized by a short NH2-terminal cytosolic domain, an amphipathic transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a COOH-terminal catalytic domain containing highly conserved sialyl motifs (van2018A).

In healthy human cells, ST3GAL3 is highly expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in neural development, learning, memory, and cognition (Khamirani2021Phenotype). The enzyme's activity is essential for proper cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are vital for neural stem cell behavior, cell migration, adhesion, and synapse formation (van2018A). The sialylation process facilitated by ST3GAL3 is also important for maintaining the stability of glycoproteins and ensuring effective cell signaling (Indellicato2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ST3GAL3 gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. ST3GAL3 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, results from mutations in this gene and is linked to intellectual disability, epilepsy, motor development delay, and behavioral disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (Khamirani2021Phenotype). Specific mutations such as p.Ala13Asp and p.Asp370Tyr are associated with non-syndromic intellectual disability, while p.Ala320Pro is linked to more severe syndromic forms, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 15 (Khamirani2021Phenotype).

A novel variant, p.(Thr235Met), has been identified in Iranian patients with non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability, affecting the protein's stability and conformation (Farajollahi2020A). Another variant, p.Y220*, results in a truncated protein and is associated with severe epilepsy and neuromotor delay (Indellicato2019A). These mutations lead to a loss of sialyltransferase enzyme activity, impacting the sialylation of glycoproteins, which is crucial for normal neurological function (Indellicato2019A).

Alterations in ST3GAL3 expression have also been linked to cancer progression, affecting cell proliferation and signaling pathways, although the specific mechanisms remain under investigation (Qi2019ST3GAL3).

## Interactions
ST3GAL3 is involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins, which plays a significant role in cell signaling and interactions. The enzyme specifically affects the activation of the AKT signaling pathway, suggesting that it modifies glycoproteins that regulate cell proliferation and survival (Gu2024Specific; Qi2019ST3GAL3). In knockout studies, the absence of ST3GAL3 led to decreased phosphorylation levels of AKT, indicating its involvement in signaling pathways related to cell proliferation (Qi2019ST3GAL3).

ST3GAL3 also influences cell morphology and adhesion. Knockout cells lacking ST3GAL3 exhibited increased expression of adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and claudin-1, which promote cell-cell adhesion (Qi2019ST3GAL3). This suggests that ST3GAL3 may interact with proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, affecting cell morphology and proliferation.

The enzyme's role in modifying specific glycoproteins is highlighted by its impact on the α2,3-sialylation of β1 integrin. In ST3GAL3 knockout cells, there was an increase in α2,3-sialylation of β1 integrin, indicating that ST3GAL3 may compete with other sialyltransferases for substrate binding (Qi2019ST3GAL3). These interactions underscore the enzyme's involvement in regulating cell functions and its potential impact on cellular signaling and adhesion.
