# ACP4

## Overview
ACP4 is a gene that encodes the protein acid phosphatase 4, a transmembrane enzyme belonging to the histidine acid phosphatase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in enamel formation, particularly during the development of teeth. Acid phosphatase 4 is primarily expressed in secretory stage ameloblasts, where it localizes to Tomes' processes and the ameloblast lateral plasma membrane, facilitating the dephosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) such as ENAM, AMBN, and AMEL. This dephosphorylation is crucial for the regulation of EMP secretion and turnover, which in turn affects the elongation and organization of enamel mineral ribbons (Liang2022Enamel). Unlike its paralogs ACP2 and ACP3, ACP4 is not a lysosomal enzyme, underscoring its unique function in enamel mineralization (Liang2022Enamel). Mutations in the ACP4 gene are linked to hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by thin and improperly formed enamel, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in dental health (Kim2021Recessive; Liang2022Enamel).

## Structure
The ACP4 protein is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the histidine acid phosphatase family. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-26), an extracellular domain (amino acids 27-393), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 394-414), and a cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 415-426) (Liang2022Enamel). The extracellular domain contains N-glycosylation target sequences at residues N191, N269, N330, and N339, and disulfide bonds connecting C159-C378, C214-C312, and C353-C357, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Liang2022Enamel).

The tertiary structure of ACP4 involves the folding of its extracellular domain, which is essential for its function in enamel formation. The protein forms a homodimer, and specific mutations such as p.(Pro140Leu) and p.(Gln117Arg) are located at the homodimer interface, potentially affecting dimerization (Kim2021Recessive). These structural features are critical for the protein's role in dephosphorylating enamel matrix proteins, a process that may be pH-dependent and localized near ameloblasts during enamel formation (Liang2022Enamel). The ACP4 protein is not a lysosomal enzyme but is localized to Tomes' processes and the ameloblast lateral plasma membrane, indicating its specific role in enamel development (Liang2022Enamel).

## Function
ACP4 (acid phosphatase 4) is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in enamel formation, particularly during tooth development. It is expressed strongly in secretory stage ameloblasts, where it localizes primarily at Tomes' processes, which are involved in the secretion and turnover of enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) such as ENAM, AMBN, and AMEL (Liang2022Enamel). Unlike its paralogs ACP2 and ACP3, ACP4 is not primarily a lysosomal protein due to the absence of lysosomal sorting signals, indicating its unique role in enamel mineralization (Liang2022Enamel).

ACP4 is hypothesized to dephosphorylate EMPs, regulating their secretion and turnover at the mineralization front, which is crucial for the proper elongation and organization of enamel mineral ribbons (Liang2022Enamel). The protein's activity may be pH-dependent, functioning in localized acidic environments near ameloblasts during enamel crystallization (Liang2022Enamel). Mutations in ACP4 can lead to hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, characterized by thin and improperly formed enamel, highlighting its essential role in dental health (Kim2021Recessive; Liang2022Enamel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACP4 gene are associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a genetic disorder affecting enamel formation. AI can manifest in various forms, including hypoplastic, hypomature, and hypocalcified enamel, or as a combination of these conditions (Kim2021Recessive). Specific mutations in ACP4, such as c.774_775del, p.Gly260Aspfs*29, and other single nucleotide variants, have been linked to hypoplastic AI, characterized by thin enamel layers and enamel malformations (Liang2022Enamel). These mutations often result in reduced protein expression, impaired homodimer formation, and decreased acid phosphatase activity, which are crucial for proper enamel development (Kim2021Recessive).

In canine models, a 1-bp duplication in ACP4 has been identified, leading to a frameshift mutation that disrupts the transmembrane domain of the protein, causing hypoplastic enamel in affected dogs (Hytönen2019Canine). This canine model provides insights into the pathophysiology of AI and highlights the potential role of ACP4 in odontoblast differentiation and mineralization during dentine formation (Hytönen2019Canine).

Overall, ACP4 mutations are significant in the pathogenesis of AI, emphasizing their clinical importance in dental health (Kim2021Recessive).

## Interactions
ACP4, or acid phosphatase 4, is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its function in biological systems. In the context of enamel formation, ACP4 is hypothesized to dephosphorylate enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) to regulate their secretion and turnover, although the exact biological substrates remain unclear. This activity might be pH-dependent, functioning in localized acidic environments during enamel formation (Liang2022Enamel). ACP4 localizes to the lateral membrane of secretory stage ameloblasts, suggesting a role in enamel protein secretion (Liang2022Enamel).

In Arabidopsis, ACP4 interacts with acyl-ACP-utilizing enzymes such as stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT), as demonstrated by yeast 2-hybrid assays. These interactions suggest that ACP4 plays a crucial role in acyl lipid biosynthesis by potentially forming interactomes or metabolomes with other lipid enzymes like GPAT and LPAT for local lipid channeling (Xu2023Arabidopsis). Structural models predicted using AlphaFold2 indicate that helix 2 of ACP4 might be involved in its interaction with SAD and LPAT (Xu2023Arabidopsis). These interactions highlight ACP4's role in modulating chloroplast lipid assembly and its potential regulatory functions in lipid biosynthesis pathways (Xu2023Arabidopsis).
