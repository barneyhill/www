# ABCA8

## Overview
The ABCA8 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 8 (ABCA8) protein, which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is characterized by its role as a transmembrane transporter, primarily involved in the efflux of cholesterol and taurocholate, contributing to lipid homeostasis in the liver (Sasaki2018ATPBinding). ABCA8 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, heart, and central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in processes such as cholesterol metabolism and sphingomyelin production in oligodendrocytes (Kim2013ABCA8). The protein's interaction with ABCA1 suggests a synergistic role in cholesterol efflux, which is significant for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) regulation (TriguerosMotos2017ABCA8). Clinically, mutations in ABCA8 have been associated with altered HDL levels and potential implications in cardiovascular diseases and cancer prognosis (Guo2020Prognostic; Wang2020A).

## Structure
The ABCA8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically the subfamily A. The ABCA8 protein is composed of 1621 amino acids and is predicted to contain 14 transmembrane domains and two putative ATP-binding cassettes, although it lacks the common ABC transporter motif LSGGQ (Wang2020A). The full-size variant of ABCA8 includes both ATP-binding domains, while a shorter variant lacks one of these domains (Sasaki2018ATPBinding).

In terms of localization, the full-size ABCA8 protein is expressed in the human liver and is localized on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes (Sasaki2018ATPBinding). In mouse liver, the mABCA8b variant is predominantly found on the sinusoidal plasma membrane (Sasaki2018ATPBinding). The protein's role as a transporter is highlighted by its involvement in the efflux of cholesterol and taurocholate in both human and mouse liver cells (Sasaki2018ATPBinding).

The ABCA8 protein is also suggested to be involved in stimulating sphingomyelin production in oligodendrocytes and is related to anionic drug transport across Xenopus laevis oocyte membranes (Wang2020A). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ABCA8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ABCA8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically the A subfamily. This protein is involved in the efflux transport of cholesterol and taurocholate in the liver, contributing to lipid homeostasis. In human liver cells, ABCA8 is localized on the plasma membranes of hepatocytes, where it mediates the active efflux of cholesterol. The presence of taurocholate enhances this cholesterol efflux, suggesting that taurocholate may act as a substrate or modulator of ABCA8 (Sasaki2018ATPBinding).

In the central nervous system, ABCA8 is expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it regulates sphingomyelin (SM) production. Altering ABCA8 expression affects the expression of SGMS1, a gene responsible for SM synthesis, indicating its role in maintaining intracellular SM concentration. This regulation is crucial for myelination processes, as ABCA8 expression correlates with age-associated increases in white matter volume and myelination in the human prefrontal cortex (Kim2013ABCA8).

ABCA8 also functions as an ATP-dependent transporter for certain substrates, including estradiol-b-glucuronide and taurocholate, in various tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. This suggests a role in the efflux of drugs and other compounds, potentially contributing to drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Tsuruoka2002Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABCA8 gene have been linked to several health conditions. A study on a Han-Chinese family identified a novel nonsense mutation in ABCA8 associated with reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This mutation was found in affected family members but not in healthy ones, suggesting a potential role in the development of ASCVD by affecting cholesterol transport (Wang2020A).

In the context of cancer, ABCA8 expression is downregulated in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and higher expression levels are linked to poor prognosis. This suggests that ABCA8 may serve as a prognostic biomarker in STAD, with its expression associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly M2 macrophages, which are known to indicate poor prognosis (Guo2020Prognostic).

ABCA8 is also involved in the transport of cholesterol and taurocholate in the liver. Alterations in its expression, such as decreased levels in conditions like cholestasis, may contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver, indicating a potential pathophysiological role in liver diseases (Sasaki2018ATPBinding).

## Interactions
ABCA8 interacts with the ABCA1 protein, which is also involved in cholesterol efflux. Both proteins localize at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, where they facilitate cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I. When coexpressed, ABCA8 and ABCA1 enhance cholesterol efflux more effectively than when expressed individually, indicating a synergistic interaction. This is supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that demonstrate a physical interaction between ABCA8 and ABCA1, suggesting they may form a complex or regulate each other's function (TriguerosMotos2017ABCA8).

The interaction between ABCA8 and ABCA1 is significant in the context of cholesterol metabolism and HDL regulation. Mutations in ABCA8 can lead to lower plasma HDLc levels, highlighting its role in HDL metabolism. The interaction may involve overlapping pathways, potentially affecting ABCA1's cholesterol efflux capacity (TriguerosMotos2017ABCA8).

While ABCA8's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism suggests it may engage in regulatory interactions within these pathways (TriguerosMotos2017ABCA8).
