# UTRN

## Overview
The UTRN gene encodes the protein utrophin, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in muscle cell integrity and function. Utrophin is a member of the dystrophin protein family and is characterized by its structural domains, including actin-binding domains and spectrin-like repeats, which facilitate its role in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Moores2000Structure; Keep1999Crystal). Unlike dystrophin, utrophin is primarily localized at the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions in healthy muscle tissue, where it contributes to the stabilization of muscle cell membranes (Dennis1996Molecular). The expression of utrophin is developmentally regulated, with higher levels in fetal tissues, suggesting its involvement in muscle development and regeneration (Clerk1993Dystrophinrelated). Clinically, utrophin is of significant interest as a therapeutic target for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), where its upregulation can compensate for the absence of dystrophin, offering a potential treatment strategy (SoblecheroMartín2021Duchenne). Additionally, UTRN has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene, with implications in various cancers, further highlighting its biological importance (Zhang2021A).

## Structure
Utrophin (UTRN) is a large cytoskeletal protein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes multiple spectrin-like repeats and actin-binding domains. The N-terminal region of utrophin contains two calponin homology (CH) domains, CH1 and CH2, which are crucial for actin binding (Keep1999Crystal). These domains are connected by a long central helix, forming an antiparallel dimer in the crystal structure, although utrophin behaves as a monomer in solution (Keep1999Crystal). 

The secondary structure of utrophin features α-helices, particularly in the CH domains, which form a helical bundle (Keep2000Structural). The tertiary structure of utrophin is characterized by a rod-like shape, with the CH domains adopting an extended conformation when bound to F-actin, suggesting a flexible binding mechanism (Moores2000Structure). 

Utrophin's quaternary structure involves dimerization in the crystal form, but it functions as a monomer when interacting with actin in solution (Keep1999Crystal). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may influence its function and localization. Splice variants of utrophin produce different isoforms, affecting its role in various tissues (SutherlandSmith2003An).

## Function
Utrophin (UTRN) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells by forming part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. This complex links the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby stabilizing muscle cell membranes. In healthy human cells, utrophin is primarily localized at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and myotendinous junctions, where it contributes to muscle fiber stability and function (Wang2011A; Dennis1996Molecular).

Utrophin shares significant structural similarities with dystrophin, including domains for F-actin binding, a central rod region, a cysteine-rich region, and a C-terminal region involved in glycoprotein binding (Schofield1993Expression). It is involved in connecting the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the epidermis and other tissues (Santas2010Utrophin).

During muscle development, utrophin levels decrease as dystrophin levels increase, suggesting a coordinated regulation between these two proteins. This regulation implies that utrophin may compensate for dystrophin deficiency in conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Wang2011A). Utrophin's expression is developmentally regulated, with higher levels observed in fetal tissues, indicating its role in muscle development and regeneration (Clerk1993Dystrophinrelated).

## Clinical Significance
The UTRN gene, encoding utrophin, is clinically significant in the context of muscular dystrophies, particularly Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a severe X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to muscle degeneration. Utrophin, a paralog of dystrophin, can partially compensate for the lack of dystrophin when overexpressed, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for DMD patients (SoblecheroMartín2021Duchenne; Sengupta2020Genome). 

Research has focused on upregulating utrophin expression using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to delete inhibitory microRNA target regions in the UTRN gene, resulting in increased utrophin levels and improved muscle function in DMD models (SoblecheroMartín2021Duchenne; Sengupta2020Genome). This approach is promising as it is applicable to all DMD patients, regardless of their specific dystrophin mutations, and does not provoke immune responses since patients are not naive to utrophin (Sengupta2020Genome).

In addition to its role in muscular dystrophies, UTRN has been implicated in cancer. It is considered a tumor suppressor gene, with decreased expression or mutations observed in various tumors, including gastric adenocarcinoma and breast cancer, where it inhibits tumor cell growth (Zhang2021A).

## Interactions
Utrophin (UTRN) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily forming part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). It binds to β-dystroglycan, α-dystrobrevin, and syntrophins through its C-terminal domain, facilitating the linkage between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix (Perronnet2010Dystrophins). Utrophin also interacts with the intermediate filament protein synemin. Synemin binds to specific regions of utrophin, including the cysteine-rich (CR) and N-terminal domains, with a-synemin TIIB showing strong binding to the CR region (Bhosle2006Interactions). These interactions are confirmed through GST pull-down assays and blot overlay assays (Bhosle2006Interactions).

Utrophin's N-terminal domain binds F-actin, and this interaction is regulated by calcium and calmodulin (Perronnet2010Dystrophins). Unlike dystrophin, utrophin binds actin through a single contiguous actin-binding domain that spans from the amino terminus through repeat 10 of the rod domain (Rybakova2006Dystrophin). This distinct mode of actin binding contributes to its functional interchangeability with dystrophin in muscle cells. Utrophin's interactions are crucial for maintaining muscle fiber integrity and are being explored for therapeutic applications in conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Rajaganapathy2019Distinct).
