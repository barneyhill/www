# MYH11

## Overview
The MYH11 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 11, a protein that plays a critical role in the contractile function of smooth muscle cells. This protein is a component of the myosin complex, which is essential for muscle contraction and cellular movement. Myosin heavy chain 11 is categorized as a motor protein due to its involvement in converting chemical energy into mechanical force, facilitating the interaction with actin filaments. The gene is expressed predominantly in smooth muscle tissues, where it contributes to the maintenance of vascular tone and gastrointestinal motility. Mutations in MYH11 are associated with various smooth muscle-related disorders, including familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, as well as gastrointestinal motility disorders (Kuang2012Rare; Pannu2007MYH11).

## Structure
The MYH11 gene encodes the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, a crucial component of the contractile apparatus in smooth muscle cells. The protein is a hexameric complex composed of two myosin heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains (Kuang2012Rare). The primary structure of MYH11 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the myosin heavy chain, which is organized into specific domains such as the head, neck, and tail regions. The head domain contains ATPase and actin-binding subdomains, essential for muscle contraction (Kuang2012Rare).

The secondary structure of MYH11 involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which fold into a three-dimensional shape to form the tertiary structure. The coiled-coil domain in the tail region enables the protein to dimerize and polymerize, forming thick filaments that interact with actin in thin filaments (Kuang2012Rare). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of myosin heavy chains with light chains to create a functional myosin molecule.

MYH11 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function. The gene also has splice variants that result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Kuang2012Rare). These structural features are critical for the protein's role in smooth muscle contraction and its involvement in various pathologies when mutated.

## Function
The MYH11 gene encodes the smooth muscle-specific isoform of myosin heavy chain, which is integral to the contractile function of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Kuang2012Rare). This protein is a key component of the contractile apparatus, interacting with actin filaments to facilitate muscle contraction and cellular movement (Kuang2012Rare). In healthy human cells, MYH11 is involved in force generation and shortening velocity, essential for maintaining aortic contractility and vascular tone (Kuang2012Rare).

MYH11 plays a crucial role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the cytoskeleton in SMCs (Burger2021Molecular). It is also involved in the maturation of focal adhesions and activation of RhoA signaling, which are critical for maintaining SMC differentiation and contractile protein expression (Kuang2012Rare). The protein's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells, where it influences processes such as blood vessel constriction and gastrointestinal motility (Kuang2012Rare).

Proper function of MYH11 is necessary for the maintenance of normal aortic contraction and the prevention of excessive proliferation and dedifferentiation of SMCs, supporting vascular health (Kuang2012Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH11 gene are associated with several vascular and smooth muscle-related disorders. MYH11 mutations are a known cause of familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), often in conjunction with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). These mutations lead to smooth muscle cell (SMC) disarray and focal hyperplasia in the aortic media, contributing to the distinct vascular pathology observed in these conditions (Milewicz2008Genetic; Pannu2007MYH11). The mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and are linked to increased expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II), which drive the disease process (Pannu2007MYH11).

MYH11 mutations are also implicated in gastrointestinal disorders, such as Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO), due to their impact on smooth muscle contractility (Gilbert2020Protein‐elongating). Additionally, a homozygous loss-of-function variant in MYH11 has been identified in cases of Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), highlighting the gene's role in smooth muscle dysfunction (Gauthier2014A).

In the cerebral vasculature, MYH11 mutations have been linked to intracranial vessel stenosis, with some cases showing similarities to moyamoya disease, although the exact role of MYH11 in this context remains unclear (Larson2020Intracranial).

## Interactions
MYH11, or myosin heavy chain 11, is involved in various protein interactions that are significant in different cellular contexts. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the CBFB::MYH11 oncofusion protein, which includes the MYH11 domain, predominantly interacts with cytoplasmic myosin-related proteins such as MYO18A, MYH9, MYL12B, and LUZP1. These interactions contribute to the cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein, which sequesters RUNX1 in cytoplasmic aggregates, potentially disrupting its normal nuclear functions (Day2023Proteogenomic). The MYH11 domain retains coiled-coil and assembly competence domains, essential for the transforming activity of CBFB::MYH11, and is suggested to mediate cytoplasmic localization and aggregation (Day2023Proteogenomic).

In gastric cancer, MYH11 interacts with TNFRSF14, where it acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to the TNFRSF14 promoter. This interaction is significant in the context of tumor progression, as MYH11 overexpression inhibits TNFRSF14 expression, affecting cell proliferation and migration (Wang2021Interaction). Additionally, MYH11 promoter hypermethylation, mediated by DNMT3B, leads to reduced MYH11 expression, which is associated with gastric cancer progression (Wang2021Interaction).
