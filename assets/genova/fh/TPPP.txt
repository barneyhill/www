# TPPP

## Overview
The TPPP gene encodes the Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP), also known as TPPP/p25, which is a key player in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This protein is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, characterized by its ability to promote tubulin polymerization and stabilize microtubules, thereby influencing cellular processes such as cell shape, motility, and division (Kovács2004Natively; DeBonis2015Self). TPPP/p25 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, impacting the development of axonal networks (Lehotzky2009Tubulin). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as DYNLL/LC8 and HDAC6, further underscore its role in modulating microtubule dynamics and intracellular trafficking (Oláh2019Interactions). Clinically, TPPP is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, where it forms pathological assemblies with alpha-synuclein (Oláh2024Perspective). Additionally, alterations in TPPP expression are associated with cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Chang2021Gain).

## Structure
The Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP), also known as TPPP/p25, is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, particularly in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, which are crucial for its microtubule binding properties (Kovács2004Natively; DeBonis2015Self). The central domain of TPPP/p25 is composed of alpha helices and is conserved across TPPP-like proteins, playing a significant role in its interaction with tubulin (DeBonis2015Self). The protein's primary structure includes a sequence that allows for tight interaction with tubulin, promoting tubulin assembly and microtubule bundling (Tirián2003TPPPp25).

TPPP/p25 is known to undergo structural changes upon binding to tubulin, which can induce the formation of unusual microtubule structures (Hlavanda2002BrainSpecific). The protein is also associated with synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, where it is found in pathological inclusions (Kovács2004Natively). TPPP/p25 does not form visible interbridges between crosslinked microtubules, likely due to its small size and disordered terminal regions (DeBonis2015Self). The protein's ability to bind and stabilize microtubules is evolutionarily conserved, as seen in studies comparing human and sponge TPPPs (Oláh2017Tubulin).

## Function
Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP), also known as TPPP/p25, is a crucial regulator of microtubule dynamics in healthy human cells. It promotes the polymerization and stabilization of tubulin, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and organization of the microtubular network. TPPP/p25 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell shape, motility, and division by stabilizing microtubules and preventing their depolymerization (Lehotzky2004Dynamic).

In oligodendrocytes, TPPP/p25 plays a significant role in differentiation by stabilizing the microtubule network, which is critical for the development and function of axonal networks. This stabilization is vital during the elongation process of oligodendrocytes before myelination (Lehotzky2009Tubulin). TPPP/p25's interaction with microtubules is dynamic, as it can rapidly associate and dissociate, which is crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle (Lehotzky2004Dynamic).

TPPP/p25 is also involved in blocking mitotic spindle formation, which can affect cell division. This function is modulated by GTP, which inhibits TPPP/p25's binding to tubulin, thereby influencing its effects on mitotic spindle formation (Tirián2003TPPPp25).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TPPP gene are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. TPPP is notably involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In these conditions, TPPP interacts with alpha-synuclein (SYN) to form pathological assemblies, such as Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA (Oláh2024Perspective). The co-localization of TPPP and SYN is a hallmark of synucleinopathies, and their interaction is critical in disease progression (Oláh2024Perspective).

In Parkinsonism, TPPP-induced SYN assemblies resist degradation due to dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome pathways. This resistance contributes to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates (Oláh2024Perspective). TPPP's altered distribution, particularly its increased cytosolic concentration, is significant in the progression of MSA and other related disorders (Oláh2024Perspective).

In bladder cancer, TPPP gene amplification is associated with disease progression. Increased TPPP copy number correlates with advanced histological grade and tumor stage, suggesting its role in tumor proliferation and migration (Chang2021Gain). These findings indicate that TPPP may serve as a biomarker for cancer progression and a potential therapeutic target (Chang2021Gain).

## Interactions
TPPP/p25, a tubulin polymerization promoting protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing microtubule dynamics and cellular processes. It interacts with DYNLL/LC8, a hub protein, forming binary and ternary complexes that include tubulin and HDAC6. This interaction is significant for microtubule dynamics, as TPPP/p25 enhances the binding of tubulin to LC8-2, suggesting the formation of multiprotein complexes (Oláh2019Interactions). TPPP/p25 also binds to HDAC6, inhibiting its deacetylase activity, which leads to hyperacetylation of the microtubule network. This interaction is crucial for regulating intracellular trafficking and the acetylation state of microtubules (Oláh2019Interactions).

TPPP/p25 interacts with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), co-localizing in aggresome-like aggregates in cells, which is relevant to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (Oláh2006Interaction). It also associates with alpha-synuclein (SYN), particularly in pathological conditions, where the CORE segment of TPPP/p25 and the SYN 126-140 segment promote aggregation, contributing to the formation of pathological complexes (Szunyogh2024Interactions). These interactions highlight TPPP/p25's role in both physiological and pathological processes, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
