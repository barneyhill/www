# ANTKMT

## Overview
ANTKMT is a gene that encodes the protein adenine nucleotide translocase lysine methyltransferase, which is involved in the post-translational modification of adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) proteins through lysine methylation. This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, a type of enzyme that adds methyl groups to specific substrates, thereby influencing their function. The methylation of ANT proteins by ANTKMT is crucial for regulating the exchange of ATP and ADP across the mitochondrial membrane, a process vital for cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis within cells, particularly in tissues with high energy demands. The activity of ANTKMT has significant implications for cellular respiration and energy balance, impacting overall metabolic health and function (Tang2021Rapid; Di2021NonHistone).

## Function
ANTKMT, or adenine nucleotide translocase lysine methyltransferase, is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function by methylating lysine residues on adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) proteins. This post-translational modification is significant for the regulation of ATP/ADP exchange across the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (Tang2021Rapid).

In healthy human cells, ANTKMT is involved in the fine-tuning of respiratory output in mitochondria. The methylation of ANT by ANTKMT decreases ATP production, suggesting a regulatory role in cellular respiration and energy balance (Di2021NonHistone). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, ensuring that energy production is aligned with cellular demands.

ANTKMT's activity is particularly important in contexts where mitochondrial function and energy metabolism are critical, such as in tissues with high energy demands. The gene's role in methylating ANT proteins highlights its importance in the broader context of cellular metabolism and energy regulation, impacting overall metabolic health and function (Tang2021Rapid; Di2021NonHistone).
