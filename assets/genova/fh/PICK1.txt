# PICK1

## Overview
PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a peripheral membrane protein involved in a variety of cellular processes, particularly in the nervous and endocrine systems. The protein encoded by PICK1 is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain and a BAR domain, which facilitate its role as a scaffold protein in synaptic plasticity and receptor trafficking. The PDZ domain allows PICK1 to interact with numerous ligands, including neurotransmitter receptors, while the BAR domain is crucial for membrane curvature and vesicle formation. PICK1 is integral to the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking in neurons, impacting synaptic strength and plasticity, and is also involved in the biogenesis and trafficking of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, such as insulin granules in pancreatic beta cells. The protein's interactions extend to various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton regulation and intracellular signaling, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular function across different tissues (Erlendsson2015Membrane; Cao2013PICK1; Holst2013PICK1).

## Structure
PICK1 is a protein characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain and a BAR domain, which contribute to its unique structural and functional properties. The PDZ domain of PICK1 is highly conserved and consists of six β-strands and two α-helices, forming a globular fold with two hydrophobic pockets, S0 and S2, that facilitate interactions with various ligands (Erlendsson2015Membrane). This domain is involved in binding over 40 different ligands, including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters (Erlendsson2015Membrane).

The BAR domain of PICK1 is involved in dimerization and membrane curvature, forming a crescent-shaped structure that facilitates the protein's scaffolding function (He2011PDZ). The BAR domain dimerizes to form a coiled-coil six-helix bundle, contributing to the protein's elongated crescent shape (Erlendsson2015Membrane). The PDZ and BAR domains are connected by a flexible linker, allowing the PDZ domains to adopt various positions relative to the BAR domain (Karlsen2015Structure).

PICK1 can form higher-order oligomeric structures, such as dimers, tetramers, and potentially octamers, with the oligomerization being concentration-dependent (Karlsen2015Structure). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its significant biological roles (Li2016Multiple).

## Function
PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase 1) is a peripheral membrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in synaptic plasticity and receptor trafficking. In neurons, PICK1 is involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking, which is crucial for synaptic strength and plasticity, impacting learning and memory. It interacts with the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors via its PDZ domain, promoting receptor internalization and influencing synaptic activity (Erlendsson2015Membrane; Jin2006Lipid).

PICK1 also plays a critical role in the biogenesis and trafficking of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells. It is involved in the formation and maturation of insulin granules in pancreatic beta cells, where it forms complexes with ICA69. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal insulin levels and glucose homeostasis, as PICK1 deficiency leads to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance (Li2018PICK1; Cao2013PICK1).

In addition to its role in the pancreas, PICK1 is involved in the trafficking of proacrosomal granules in spermatocytes and growth hormone vesicles in the pituitary gland, indicating its broader role in dense core vesicle trafficking across various tissues (Cao2013PICK1). PICK1's BAR domain is crucial for membrane curvature sensing and vesicle formation, highlighting its importance in cellular membrane dynamics (Holst2013PICK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PICK1 gene have been implicated in a variety of neurological and non-neurological disorders. In the context of neurological disorders, PICK1 is associated with schizophrenia, where it affects dopaminergic transmission and NMDAR function. Polymorphisms in PICK1 have been linked to both schizophrenia and methamphetamine-induced psychosis, potentially influencing dopamine transporter activity (Focant2013Protein). In Parkinson's disease, PICK1 interacts with parkin, affecting the localization of acid-sensing ion channels and potentially contributing to neuronal loss (Focant2013Protein).

PICK1 is also involved in synaptic plasticity and receptor trafficking, with its dysregulation linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Its interaction with Rab39B affects GluA2 trafficking, which is relevant in these disorders (Li2016Multiple). In the realm of metabolic disorders, PICK1 mutations have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Variants in the PICK1 BAR domain impair insulin granule biogenesis, leading to reduced insulin storage and secretion, contributing to glucose intolerance (Andersen2022Coding).

Additionally, PICK1 mutations are linked to globozoospermia, a male infertility disorder, due to its role in vesicle trafficking in sperm cells (Li2016Multiple). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PICK1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
PICK1 (protein interacting with PRKCA 1) is a scaffold protein that engages in numerous protein-protein interactions, primarily through its PDZ domain. It interacts with AMPA receptor subunits, such as GluR2, influencing receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity. This interaction is modulated by protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation, which affects the stability and cycling of AMPA receptors (Lu2005PICK1; Terashima2004Regulation).

PICK1 also interacts with proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, such as Kalirin-7, affecting synaptic targeting and morphology (Dev2007PDZ). It binds to the PDZ motif of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are involved in vesicle formation at the Golgi apparatus (Dev2007PDZ). PICK1's interaction with calcineurin B is significant in osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in bone tissue (Kamano2018Binding).

The protein also forms complexes with proteins like SNAP and NSF, which are crucial for AMPA receptor trafficking (Dev2007PDZ). PICK1's interactions with proteins such as TIS21/BTG2 suggest a potential role in cell growth regulation and cancer development (Dev2007PDZ). These interactions underscore PICK1's involvement in diverse cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, receptor trafficking, and intracellular signaling.
