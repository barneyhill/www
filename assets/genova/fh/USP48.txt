# USP48

## Overview
USP48 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 48, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes. This enzyme is primarily localized in the nucleus and is characterized by its ability to trim Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby regulating protein stability and function. The protein contains several domains, including an N-terminal ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain, three 'domains in USPs' (DUSP domains), and a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, which are crucial for its catalytic activity and nuclear localization (Schweitzer2015CSNassociated; Sánchez-Bellver2022The). USP48 plays a significant role in modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, interacting with the COP9 signalosome and stabilizing nuclear NF-κB/RelA, which is vital for immune responses and cell survival (Schweitzer2015CSNassociated). Additionally, USP48 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including hereditary hearing loss and corticotroph pituitary tumors, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Bassani2021Variants; Pękul2024Relevance).

## Structure
USP48 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function and localization. The protein contains an N-terminal ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity in trimming long Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains (Schweitzer2015CSNassociated; Sánchez-Bellver2022The). Following the UCH domain are three 'domains in USPs' (DUSP domains), which are associated with protein-protein interactions, although their specific functions remain unclear (Sánchez-Bellver2022The).

At the C-terminus, USP48 features a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, which adopts a three-dimensional structure similar to ubiquitin and plays a regulatory role in its catalytic activity (Sánchez-Bellver2022The; Zhu2007High). The UBL domain is also crucial for the nuclear localization of USP48, facilitated by the nuclear localization signal 938 RHRK 941 (Liu2018938RHRK941).

USP48 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by casein-kinase-2 (CK2) in the nucleus and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in the cytoplasm, which enhances its ubiquitin chain-trimming activity (Sánchez-Bellver2022The). The protein is expressed in various isoforms, with the full-length version being the most extensively studied (Sánchez-Bellver2022The).

## Function
USP48 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and function of proteins within healthy human cells. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and the NF-κB/RelA complex. USP48 stabilizes nuclear NF-κB/RelA by trimming K48-linked ubiquitin chains, preventing its proteasomal degradation and promoting its accumulation in the nucleus. This activity is essential for the regulation of NF-κB signaling, which is important for immune responses and cell survival (Schweitzer2015CSNassociated).

USP48's deubiquitinating activity is enhanced by phosphorylation through casein kinase 2 (CK2), which increases its ability to trim long ubiquitin chains while sparing short ones. This selective trimming is crucial for maintaining protein stability and regulating the turnover of nuclear RelA, thus ensuring a balanced immune response (Schweitzer2015CSNassociated).

In the retina, USP48 interacts with proteins associated with retinal degeneration, such as ARL3 and UNC119a, suggesting a role in ciliary function and photoreceptor stability. It is involved in maintaining protein stability and function in the retina, which is essential for healthy photoreceptor operation (Sánchez-Bellver2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USP48 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss (ADNSHHL). Studies have identified deleterious missense variants in USP48 in families with hearing loss, suggesting that these mutations impair the enzymatic activity of the protein, leading to auditory dysfunction. In particular, variants such as Gly406 and Thr739 have been linked to hearing loss in Italian and Dutch patients, respectively (Bassani2021Variants). Zebrafish models with usp48 knockdown exhibit hearing impairment, further supporting the gene's role in auditory function (Bassani2021Variants).

USP48 mutations have also been implicated in corticotroph pituitary tumors, particularly in female patients. These mutations are associated with less aggressive tumor growth and favorable clinical outcomes, such as lower ACTH levels and non-invasive tumors (Pękul2024Relevance).

In the context of Fanconi Anemia, USP48 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Its loss improves the survival of FA-defective cells by enhancing the recruitment of homologous recombination proteins to DNA damage sites, suggesting a role in balancing DNA repair pathways (Velimezi2018Map).

USP48 is also involved in retinal function, interacting with proteins associated with retinal degeneration. It stabilizes these proteins, indicating its potential role in inherited retinal dystrophies (Sánchez-Bellver2022The).

## Interactions
USP48, a deubiquitinating enzyme, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It physically interacts with the SIRT6 protein, stabilizing it by preventing K48-linked ubiquitination, which is crucial for SIRT6's role in regulating aerobic glycolysis and lipid metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma (Du2021USP48). USP48 also interacts with Aurora B, a protein essential for cell cycle progression. This interaction stabilizes Aurora B by reducing its polyubiquitination, thereby extending its half-life (Antao2021USP48).

USP48 is involved in the regulation of Mdm2 protein levels through a mechanism independent of its deubiquitinase activity. It forms complexes with Mdm2, stabilizing the protein and enhancing its expression (Cetkovská2017Ubiquitinspecific). Additionally, USP48 interacts with TRAF2, modulating its ubiquitination and stability, which affects downstream signaling pathways such as JNK1 activation and E-cadherin expression (Li2017The). These interactions highlight USP48's role in various cellular functions, including protein stability, cell cycle regulation, and signaling pathways.
