# RRN3

## Overview
The RRN3 gene encodes a transcription factor known as RRN3 homolog, which is crucial for the initiation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) in eukaryotic cells. This protein, also referred to as TIF-IA in humans, is integral to the recruitment of Pol I to rRNA gene promoters, facilitating the transcription of rRNA necessary for ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. Structurally, RRN3 is characterized by a unique HEAT repeat fold, which is essential for its protein-protein interactions. Functionally, RRN3 acts as a molecular switch in rRNA synthesis through its interaction with the A43 subunit of Pol I, a mechanism conserved across species. The activity of RRN3 is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its interaction with Pol I and affects transcription initiation. Clinically, alterations in the RRN3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular growth and disease pathogenesis (Blattner2011Molecular; Brownstein2016Overlapping; Rothblum2014Selective).

## Structure
The RRN3 protein, also known as TIF-IA in humans, plays a crucial role in the initiation of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. Its molecular structure is characterized by a unique HEAT repeat fold, consisting of 10 HEAT repeats formed by 20 anti-parallel alpha helices arranged in a superhelical fold. These repeats are essential for protein-protein interactions, which are critical for RRN3's function (Blattner2011Molecular).

RRN3 forms a stable homodimer in solution, as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and size exclusion chromatography. The dimerization interface includes both polar and hydrophobic residues, and mutations in these residues can affect dimer stability (Blattner2011Molecular). However, RRN3 binds to Pol I as a monomer, extending along the back of Pol I between subcomplexes AC40/19 and A14/43 (Blattner2011Molecular).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of RRN3, affecting its interaction with Pol I and its role in transcription regulation. The phosphorylation of a conserved serine patch on RRN3 is crucial for regulating Pol I transcription and cell growth (Blattner2011Molecular). This phospho-regulation mechanism is conserved across species (Blattner2011Molecular).

## Function
The RRN3 gene encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for the initiation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) in human cells. RRN3, also known as TIF-IA in humans, facilitates the recruitment of Pol I to rRNA gene promoters, a key step in the transcription of rRNA, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and cell growth (Blattner2011Molecular; Rothblum2014Selective). 

RRN3 interacts with the A43 subunit of Pol I, forming a complex that acts as a molecular switch for rRNA synthesis. This interaction is stable and does not require phosphorylation of A43, indicating a conserved mechanism across species (Peyroche2000The). The RRN3-Pol I complex is essential for the formation of a transcriptionally competent Pol I, enabling the synthesis of the 47S pre-rRNA, a precursor to mature rRNAs (Rothblum2014Selective).

The activity of RRN3 is regulated by phosphorylation, which can modulate its interaction with Pol I and affect transcription initiation. Under normal conditions, RRN3 binds to Pol I, promoting transcription, while stress-induced phosphorylation can impair this interaction, reducing transcription and cell growth (Blattner2011Molecular). RRN3 is active in the nucleolus, where it plays a vital role in linking nutrient availability to rRNA production, thereby regulating cell growth and proliferation (Blattner2011Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the RRN3 gene, which encodes a transcription factor essential for RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription, have been implicated in various diseases. In cancer, the interaction between RRN3 and the rpa43 subunit of RNA polymerase I is crucial for rRNA synthesis. Disruption of this interaction, such as through the use of inhibitory peptides, can significantly reduce rRNA synthesis, affecting ribosome biogenesis and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. This suggests that targeting the RRN3-rpa43 interaction could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment (Rothblum2014Selective).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, RRN3 is located within the 16p13.11 chromosomal region, which is associated with copy number variations linked to conditions such as childhood-onset psychosis and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Alterations in RRN3, along with other genes in this region, may disrupt synaptic plasticity pathways, potentially contributing to these disorders (Brownstein2016Overlapping; Buttermore202216p13.11). The mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates RRN3, is also implicated in these conditions, highlighting the gene's broader significance in both cancer and neurological disorders (Nguyen2015Regulation).

## Interactions
The RRN3 protein, also known as TIF-IA in humans, plays a crucial role in the initiation of ribosomal RNA synthesis by interacting with RNA polymerase I (Pol I). RRN3 forms a complex with the A43 subunit of Pol I, which is essential for the recruitment of Pol I to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoters. This interaction acts as a molecular switch to regulate rRNA synthesis, and post-translational modifications of RRN3 and/or A43 may influence this process (Rothblum2014Selective; Peyroche2000The).

The interaction between RRN3 and the A43 subunit is highly conserved across species, from yeast to humans, indicating its evolutionary importance. Human RRN3 can functionally replace yeast RRN3, underscoring the conservation of this interaction (Peyroche2000The). A specific region of the RPA43 subunit, comprising amino acids 136 to 157, is necessary for binding to RRN3. This region, known as the '22mer', is crucial for the interaction, and its disruption can inhibit rDNA transcription (Rothblum2014Selective).

RRN3 also interacts with other components of the transcription machinery, such as the core factor subunit RRN6, suggesting a role in the assembly and recruitment of the Pol I complex to the promoter (Peyroche2000The).
