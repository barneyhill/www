# WNK3

## Overview
WNK3, or WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine-threonine kinase belonging to the WNK (With No lysine [K]) kinase family. This family is characterized by the absence of a conserved lysine residue in the ATP-binding site, a feature that distinguishes it from other kinases (Holden2004Cloning). The WNK3 protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ion transport and homeostasis, particularly in the kidneys, where it modulates the activity of various cation-chloride cotransporters and ion channels. These functions are crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure homeostasis (Rinehart2005WNK3; PachecoAlvarez2011WNK3). WNK3 is also involved in the regulation of calcium channels and cell volume, highlighting its broad impact on cellular physiology (de2006WNK3; Zhang2008WNK3). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct tissue distributions, which suggests functional diversity (Holden2004Cloning). Given its regulatory roles, WNK3 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including hypertension and cerebral edema, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Rodan2017WNK).

## Structure
The WNK3 protein is a member of the WNK kinase family, characterized by the absence of a conserved catalytic lysine in subdomain II, which is typically crucial for ATP binding in eukaryotic protein kinases. Instead, WNK3 utilizes a lysine in subdomain I for its catalytic function (Holden2004Cloning). The primary structure of WNK3 includes a kinase domain within the CR1 region, which spans approximately 400 amino acids. This region also contains a 72 amino acid stretch homologous to the autoinhibitory domain of WNK1 and a conserved negatively charged segment (Holden2004Cloning).

The secondary structure of WNK3 likely involves typical kinase features such as alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a compact kinase fold in its tertiary structure. The CR3 region of WNK3 includes two potential coiled-coil domains, which may facilitate interactions between WNK3 monomers or with other proteins, suggesting a quaternary structure involving protein-protein interactions (Holden2004Cloning).

WNK3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that maintain the open reading frame. These isoforms exhibit distinct tissue distribution patterns, indicating functional diversity (Holden2004Cloning). Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification that affects the flexibility and stability of WNK3, particularly in the A-loop region (Jonniya2020A).

## Function
WNK3 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 3) is a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport and homeostasis in human cells. It is involved in the modulation of cation-chloride cotransporters, such as NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC, which are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure homeostasis. WNK3 enhances the phosphorylation and surface expression of these transporters, promoting NaCl reabsorption in the kidney, particularly in the thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (Rinehart2005WNK3; PachecoAlvarez2011WNK3).

WNK3 also regulates the ROMK1 potassium channel by decreasing its expression at the plasma membrane, which is independent of its catalytic activity. This regulation is specific to ROMK1 and does not affect other ion channels like ENaC (Leng2006WNK3). Additionally, WNK3 influences cell volume regulation by modulating the activity of K-Cl cotransporters (KCCs) and Na-(K)-Cl cotransporters, responding to changes in cell volume and intracellular chloride concentration (de2006WNK3; PachecoAlvarez2020WNK3).

In epithelial cells, WNK3 is involved in the regulation of calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6, enhancing their trafficking and activity through a kinase-dependent pathway (Zhang2008WNK3). These functions highlight WNK3's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its impact on physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance.

## Clinical Significance
WNK3 is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in regulating ion transport and cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in WNK3 expression or function can impact blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance, contributing to conditions such as hereditary hypertension with hyperkalemia. This condition is characterized by increased NaCl reabsorption and decreased K+ secretion, which are processes influenced by WNK3's regulation of the ROMK1 potassium channel and the NCC sodium-chloride cotransporter (Leng2006WNK3).

Mutations in WNK3, similar to those in related kinases WNK1 and WNK4, may mimic normal physiological phenomena, potentially affecting the regulation of pathways involved in blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis (Leng2006WNK3). Although specific diseases directly associated with WNK3 mutations are not detailed, its regulatory role suggests a potential link to conditions like pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), which is associated with hypertension and hyperkalemia (de2006WNK3; Rinehart2005WNK3).

WNK3 also plays a role in cerebral edema following stroke, where its knockout in mice has been shown to reduce edema and improve neurological outcomes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for stroke treatment (Rodan2017WNK).

## Interactions
WNK3 interacts with several proteins, influencing various ion channels and transporters. It positively regulates epithelial calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 through a kinase-dependent pathway, enhancing calcium influx and sodium current. This regulation involves the kinase domain of WNK3, which is sufficient to increase TRPV5-mediated calcium transport, and is abolished by a kinase-inactive mutation (Zhang2008WNK3).

WNK3 also interacts with the renal Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC) and the ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4-2. It can counteract the NEDD4-2-mediated inhibition of NCC, suggesting a regulatory interaction that is independent of the phosphorylation of specific serine residues. This interaction does not involve the classic PPxY motif, as WNK3 lacks this motif, but a 'PY-like' motif was identified and tested (Lagnaz2014WNK3).

In addition, WNK3 modulates the potassium channel ROMK1 (Kir1.1) by reducing its surface expression, an effect that is not dependent on WNK3's kinase activity. This suggests that WNK3 primarily affects ROMK1 through protein trafficking rather than direct phosphorylation (Leng2006WNK3). These interactions highlight WNK3's role in regulating ion transport and cellular processes.
