# PCDH15

## Overview
Protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein crucial for sensory functions, particularly in the auditory and visual systems. The protein, also known as protocadherin related 15, is a member of the cadherin superfamily and is characterized by its involvement in mechanotransduction processes within the inner ear's hair cells, where it plays a pivotal role in converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals necessary for hearing and balance (Senften2006Physical; Ahmed2003PCDH15). PCDH15 is also expressed in the retina, suggesting a role in visual function (Ahmed2003PCDH15). Structurally, the protein features multiple extracellular cadherin domains, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic domain, forming complexes with other proteins such as cadherin-23 and myosin VIIa to maintain the integrity and function of sensory cells (Ge2018Structure; Choudhary2020Structural). Mutations in the PCDH15 gene are linked to Usher syndrome type 1F and nonsyndromic deafness DFNB23, highlighting its clinical significance in hereditary sensory disorders (Alagramam2001Mutations; Ahmed2001Mutations).

## Structure
Protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) is a protein characterized by its complex molecular structure, which plays a crucial role in hearing and balance. The primary structure of PCDH15 includes 11 extracellular cadherin domains, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic domain (Ge2018Structure). The secondary structure features a classic cadherin fold in the EC11 domain and a ferredoxin-like fold in the EL domain (Ge2018Structure). 

In terms of tertiary structure, PCDH15 forms a robust dimeric complex with LHFPL5, with the EC11-EL domains forming a 2-fold symmetric dimer with an oval, disk-like shape. This dimer is stabilized by a mannose moiety and exhibits distinct electrostatic potential distributions, with the EC11 domain having a positively charged surface and the EL domain a negatively charged one, except at the C-terminal helix (Ge2018Structure). 

The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterotetrameric complex with cadherin-23 (CDH23), where PCDH15 forms parallel dimers that interact through an anti-parallel 'handshake' of their cadherin domains (Choudhary2020Structural). PCDH15 also exhibits flexibility in its linker regions, which contributes to its mechanical properties and function in mechanotransduction (Choudhary2020Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its dimerization states (Choudhary2020Structural).

## Function
Protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) is a protein encoded by the PCDH15 gene, playing a crucial role in the mechanotransduction process in hair cells of the inner ear, which is essential for hearing and balance. In healthy human cells, PCDH15 is involved in the morphogenesis and cohesion of stereocilia bundles in inner ear hair cells, facilitating the conversion of sound-induced vibrations into electrical signals (Senften2006Physical; Ahmed2003PCDH15). PCDH15 forms extracellular linkages with cadherin-23 (CDH23), which are vital for the integrity and function of hair bundles, acting as mechanosensors for sound and head movements (Goodman2017Integrin).

PCDH15 is also expressed in the photoreceptor cells of the retina, particularly in the outer segments of both rod and cone photoreceptors, suggesting its role in visual function (Ahmed2003PCDH15). The protein is involved in maintaining the structure and function of these sensory cells, contributing to the stability and function of stereocilia and photoreceptors. PCDH15's interaction with myosin VIIa (MYO7A) is crucial for hair bundle morphogenesis and polarity, indicating a cooperative interaction necessary for proper auditory and vestibular function (Senften2006Physical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCDH15 gene are associated with Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F) and nonsyndromic deafness DFNB23. USH1F is characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and retinitis pigmentosa, leading to progressive vision loss. Mutations in PCDH15 disrupt the normal function of hair cells in the inner ear and photoreceptor cells in the retina, contributing to these sensory impairments (Alagramam2001Mutations; Ahmed2001Mutations).

Specific mutations in PCDH15, such as missense, nonsense, and splice-site mutations, have been identified in individuals with USH1F and DFNB23. For instance, the missense mutations p.R134G and p.G262D are linked to nonsyndromic deafness, affecting the formation of lateral links between stereocilia in the inner ear, which are crucial for hearing function (Ahmed2003PCDH15). In USH1F, more severe mutations, such as nonsense mutations, lead to a complete loss of function, resulting in both hearing and vision impairments (Ahmed2001Mutations).

The PCDH15 gene's role in these conditions highlights the importance of its normal interactions and expression levels in maintaining sensory functions. Disruptions in these processes due to genetic mutations underscore the clinical significance of PCDH15 in hereditary sensory disorders (Zheng2004Digenic; Ahmed2008Gene).

## Interactions
Protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in mechanotransduction within sensory hair cells. PCDH15 forms a complex with cadherin-23 (CDH23), creating the tip links that are crucial for opening mechano-sensitive ion channels in hair cells. This interaction is vital for hearing and balance perception, as it influences the mechanical properties of the tip links (Choudhary2020Structural).

PCDH15 also interacts with the scaffold protein whirlin, which supports its anchoring of hair-bundle lateral links in cochlear hair cells. This interaction is important for the structural integrity and function of these cells (Michel2020Interaction). Additionally, PCDH15 binds to myosin VIIa (MYO7A), a protein involved in the development and function of hair bundles. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the integrity and polarity of hair bundles, and its disruption can lead to defects in mechanotransduction (Senften2006Physical).

PCDH15 is also known to interact with harmonin, another protein involved in hair bundle development, suggesting a complex network of interactions that are essential for the proper function of sensory hair cells (Senften2006Physical).
