# CES3

## Overview
The CES3 gene encodes the enzyme carboxylesterase 3, a member of the carboxylesterase family, which is characterized by its α/β hydrolase fold. This enzyme is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis, functioning predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and adipocytes. CES3 plays a critical role in lipolysis, facilitating the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids, which are essential for energy expenditure and heat production, particularly under conditions of cold exposure and β-adrenergic signaling (Yang2019A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the regulation of thermogenic genes and the activation of transcription factors that promote non-shivering thermogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in obesity and metabolic disorders (Mukherjee2019Novel; Yang2019A).

## Structure
The CES3 protein consists of 571 amino acid residues and is part of the carboxylesterase family, which typically features an α/β hydrolase fold. The primary structure of CES3 includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser228, Glu345, and His458, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Holmes2010Mammalian). The secondary structure of CES3 is similar to CES1, featuring α-helix and β-sheet structures near key residues or functional domains, such as the N-terminal signal peptide and the active site (Holmes2010Mammalian). The tertiary structure of human CES3 is predicted to be similar to CES1, with a single helix and two β-sheet structures at the C-termini and four β-sheet structures at the N-termini (Holmes2010Mammalian).

CES3 is predicted to be a monomer, unlike the oligomeric CES1, due to the absence of charge clamps responsible for subunit interaction (Holmes2010Mammalian). The protein also contains a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal tetrapeptide sequence (QEDL), which is involved in localization within endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Holmes2010Recommended). Potential N-glycosylation sites are present at various positions, although CES3 lacks the N-glycosylation site found in CES1 at Asn79-Ala80-Thr81 (Holmes2010Recommended).

## Function
Carboxylesterase 3 (CES3) is an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis, primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and adipocytes. CES3 plays a significant role in lipolysis, the process of breaking down lipids, and is crucial for energy expenditure and thermogenesis, particularly in response to cold exposure and β-adrenergic signaling (Yang2019A). It targets lipid droplets in adipose tissues, facilitating the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids, which are then used to generate heat (Yang2019A).

CES3 is also involved in the regulation of thermogenic genes such as UCP1 and PGC1a, which are essential for non-shivering thermogenesis in brown and white adipose tissues (Yang2019A). The enzyme's activity is linked to the activation of transcription factors like PPARγ, which promote the expression of these thermogenic genes (Yang2019A). Inhibition of CES3 results in decreased lipolysis and impaired thermogenic capacity, highlighting its role in maintaining body temperature and energy balance (Yang2019A). CES3's function in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis suggests its potential as a target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders (Mukherjee2019Novel).
