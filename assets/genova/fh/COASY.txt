# COASY

## Overview
The COASY gene encodes the enzyme Coenzyme A synthase, a bifunctional protein that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), an essential cofactor in numerous metabolic pathways. Coenzyme A synthase is categorized as a bifunctional enzyme due to its two catalytic domains: phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) and dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK), which facilitate the final steps of CoA production. This enzyme is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is involved in key cellular processes, including fatty acid metabolism and energy production. The COASY gene is expressed in various splice variants, with COASY alpha being ubiquitously expressed and COASY beta predominantly found in the brain. Mutations in COASY are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as COASY protein-associated neurodegeneration (CoPAN), highlighting its significance in maintaining neurological health (Cavestro2024CoA; Dusi2014Exome; Zheng2024COASY).

## Structure
The COASY gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in the final steps of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. The protein consists of two catalytic domains: the phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) domain and the dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK) domain, which are responsible for the sequential enzymatic steps required for CoA synthesis (Lin2018CoA; Dusi2014Exome; Cavestro2024CoA). The DPCK domain is crucial for ATP binding and phosphotransfer reactions, with specific residues like Arg499 playing a significant role in its function and stability (Dusi2014Exome).

COASY exists in three splice variants: COASY alpha, COASY beta, and COASY gamma. COASY alpha is ubiquitously expressed, while COASY beta is predominantly found in the brain and includes a 29 amino acid extension at the N terminus. COASY gamma is predicted to code for the C-terminal region of CoA synthase, corresponding to the DPCK domain (Dusi2014Exome).

The protein is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix, with COASY alpha and beta anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane or localized within the mitochondrial matrix (Dusi2014Exome). The COASY protein's role in fatty acid metabolism and its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases highlight its importance in cellular function (Zheng2024COASY; Cavestro2024CoA).

## Function
The COASY gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme, CoA synthase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the final two steps of CoA production, involving the conversion of 4'-phosphopantetheine into dephospho-CoA and its subsequent phosphorylation to form CoA (Cavestro2023Inherited; Dusi2014Exome). CoA is an essential cofactor in numerous biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids, and the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids (Cavestro2023Inherited).

COASY is primarily localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane and the mitochondrial matrix, but it can also be found in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Cavestro2023Inherited). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various intracellular and extracellular stimuli, such as hormones and nutrients, and is modulated by post-translational modifications like tyrosine phosphorylation (Martinez2014Coenzyme). In healthy cells, COASY functions to maintain adequate levels of CoA, which is vital for energy production and cellular metabolism (Cavestro2023Inherited). The regulation of CoA levels within different cellular compartments is crucial for maintaining cellular functions and responding to metabolic demands (Martinez2014Coenzyme).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COASY gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably COASY protein-associated neurodegeneration (CoPAN), which is part of the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) group. CoPAN is characterized by movement disorders such as dystonia and parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, and brain iron accumulation. Patients often exhibit symptoms like mild oro-mandibular dystonia, dysarthria, spastic-dystonic gait, and severe parkinsonism, with MRI findings showing hypointensity in the globus pallidus and swelling of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus (Di2019Inborn; Di2020Neuronal).

Biallelic loss-of-function variants in COASY have been associated with prenatal onset pontocerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and arthrogryposis, leading to a lethal phenotype in the perinatal period (van2018Biallelic). These mutations result in a near-complete loss of CoA synthase activity, which is crucial for CoA biosynthesis (van2018Biallelic).

The COASY gene is also implicated in NBIA, where mutations lead to iron accumulation in the basal ganglia and progressive neurological deterioration. This condition is marked by symptoms such as spastic-dystonic paraparesis, cognitive impairment, and obsessive-compulsive behavior (Dusi2014Exome).

## Interactions
COASY (Coenzyme A synthase) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. During mitosis, COASY interacts with CBP (CREB-binding protein) and TPX2, playing a crucial role in regulating mitotic fidelity. It inhibits CBP-mediated acetylation of TPX2, which is essential for proper spindle assembly and mitotic progression. This interaction is stage-specific and helps prevent genomic instability by ensuring the correct timing of TPX2 degradation and Aurora A kinase inactivation (Lin2018CoA).

COASY also interacts with components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, including PI3K-P85α and P70S6K1. These interactions suggest COASY's role in modulating the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is associated with radioresistance in cancer cells. COASY's interaction with PI3K-P85α involves the SH2 and SH3 domains and is dependent on its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (Breus2009CoA; Ferrandon2020CoA).

Additionally, COASY interacts with S6K1, a kinase in the mTOR/S6K pathway, through its C-terminal region. This interaction is inducible by serum and PMA stimulation, linking CoA biosynthesis with energy metabolism regulation (Nemazanyy2004Specific).
