# SDF2L1

## Overview
The SDF2L1 gene encodes the stromal cell derived factor 2 like 1 protein, which is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response system. This protein is categorized as a chaperone and is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a significant role in managing unfolded proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis. SDF2L1 forms a complex with the ER-resident chaperone ERdj3, enhancing its chaperone activity and preventing protein aggregation. The protein is retained in the ER by a C-terminal HDEL motif, which is essential for its function in the ER stress response and unfolded protein response (UPR). Dysregulation of SDF2L1 has been linked to various metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Yagil2023Dysregulated; Hanafusa2019SDF2like; Sasako2019Hepatic).

## Structure
The SDF2L1 protein is characterized by the presence of three MIR domains, which are predicted to form β-trefoil structures. These structures are important for protein stability and are conserved within the SDF2 family (Hanafusa2019SDF2like). The β-trefoil fold is a common structural motif found in various proteins, including protein O-mannosyltransferases and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (Hanafusa2019SDF2like). 

SDF2L1 forms a complex with ERdj3, a canonical HSP40 co-chaperone, in a 1:1 molar ratio, resulting in a heterotetramer composed of two ERdj3 and two SDF2L1 subunits (Hanafusa2019SDF2like). This complex formation is crucial for enhancing the chaperone activity of ERdj3, suggesting that SDF2L1 may stabilize the conformation of ERdj3, thereby increasing its heat stability and chaperone function (Hanafusa2019SDF2like).

The SDF2L1 protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a C-terminal HDEL motif, which is essential for its ER localization and function (Hanafusa2019SDF2like). This motif prevents the secretion of SDF2L1 into the extracellular space, ensuring its role in ER-associated processes (Hanafusa2019SDF2like).

## Function
The SDF2L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in healthy human cells. It is significantly upregulated during feeding, which induces a transient ER stress response. SDF2L1 is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it likely deals with unfolded proteins and interacts with TMED10, a membrane protein involved in protein trafficking (Sasako2019Hepatic). The protein forms a complex with ERdj3, enhancing its chaperone activity and preventing protein aggregation during the BiP chaperone cycle. This complex is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by retaining ERdj3 in the ER, thus enhancing its chaperone activity compared to ERdj3 alone (Hanafusa2019SDF2like).

SDF2L1 is also involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), where it is specifically induced during ER stress to inhibit further aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins (Yagil2023Dysregulated). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining normal glucose and lipid homeostasis by terminating transient ER stress responses following feeding, thus preventing insulin resistance and excessive triglyceride accumulation (Sasako2019Hepatic). Dysregulation of SDF2L1 is linked to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Sasako2019Hepatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SDF2L1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving metabolic and stress response pathways. In the context of diet-induced diabetes, a mutation in the SDF2L1 gene in the Cohen diabetic rat model leads to impaired unfolded protein response (UPR) and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This mutation prevents the translation of the SDF2L1 protein, resulting in reduced insulin secretion and contributing to the diabetic phenotype (Yagil2023Dysregulated).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-EOC), alterations in SDF2L1 expression have been associated with therapy response and survival outcomes. Low expression of SDF2L1 is linked to shorter survival and increased resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Benvenuto2020Expression).

SDF2L1 also plays a role in managing ER stress in the liver, with its downregulation linked to insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In obese and diabetic models, insufficient SDF2L1 expression correlates with increased ER stress and metabolic dysregulation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sasako2019Hepatic).

## Interactions
SDF2L1 interacts with the ER-resident chaperone protein ERdj3 to form a functional chaperone complex. This interaction occurs at a 1:1 molar ratio, resulting in a heterotetramer composed of two ERdj3 and two SDF2L1 molecules. This complex enhances the chaperone activity of ERdj3, particularly in preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Hanafusa2019SDF2like). The ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex is effective in inhibiting the aggregation of denatured proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), and is comparable to the chaperone activity of BiP, although it operates independently of BiP (Hanafusa2019SDF2like).

SDF2L1 also interacts with TMED10, a membrane protein involved in protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is crucial for the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where SDF2L1 and TMED10 cooperate to manage ER stress and maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis (Sasako2019Hepatic). The absence of SDF2L1 disrupts these interactions, leading to impaired ERAD and increased ER stress, which are linked to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Sasako2019Hepatic).
