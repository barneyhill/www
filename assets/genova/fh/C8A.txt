# C8A

## Overview
The C8A gene encodes the alpha chain of complement component 8 (C8), a critical component of the immune system's membrane attack complex (MAC). The protein product, known as the complement C8 alpha chain, is integral to the formation of the MAC, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by forming pores in the membranes of target cells, leading to cell lysis. The C8 alpha chain is characterized by a membrane attack complex perforin (MACPF) domain, which is essential for its pore-forming function, and it forms a heterodimer with the C8 gamma chain, while also associating with the C8 beta chain to form the complete C8 protein complex. This complex is crucial for the assembly of the MAC, which disrupts pathogen cell membranes. Mutations in the C8A gene can lead to deficiencies in the MAC, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria species (Densen2020A; Kaufmann1993The; Lovelace2011Structure).

## Structure
The C8A gene encodes the alpha chain of the complement component 8 (C8), which is part of the membrane attack complex (MAC) involved in immune defense. The C8α subunit contains a membrane attack complex perforin (MACPF) domain, crucial for its role in pore formation (Lovelace2011Structure; Hadders2007Structure). The MACPF domain is structurally similar to bacterial pore-forming proteins known as cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (Hadders2007Structure).

The C8α subunit forms a heterodimer with C8γ through a disulfide bond and is noncovalently associated with C8β, contributing to the quaternary structure of the C8 protein (Lovelace2008Crystal). The C8α and C8β subunits share a similar fold, with a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helical bundles (Lovelace2011Structure). The C8α subunit also contains thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) domains, which are sites for C-mannosylation, a post-translational modification that may play a role in MAC assembly (Franc2018Comprehensive).

The C8α subunit has several post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at specific sites, contributing to its structural diversity and function (Franc2018Comprehensive). The presence of splice variant isoforms has not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The C8A gene encodes the alpha chain of complement component 8, which is a crucial part of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the complement system. This protein plays a significant role in the body's innate immune defense by forming pores in the membranes of target cells, leading to cell lysis. The MAC is formed through a series of interactions that begin with the cleavage of complement component C5, eventually leading to the assembly of the C5b-9 complex on the surface of pathogens (Kaufmann1993The; Kaufman1989Chromosomal).

The C8 protein is composed of three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma, with the alpha chain being disulfide-linked to the gamma chain. This alpha-gamma dimer is non-covalently associated with the beta chain, forming a functional unit that integrates into the MAC (Kaufmann1993The). The C8A gene, located on chromosome 1, is essential for the formation of this complex, which disrupts the cell membranes of pathogens, thereby contributing to the immune response (Kaufman1989Chromosomal).

In healthy human cells, the C8A protein is active in the extracellular space, where it participates in the immune system's defense mechanisms by targeting and lysing invading pathogens (Willis2018Exploratory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C8A gene, which encodes the alpha chain of complement component 8, are associated with C8α-γ deficiency, particularly in African Americans. This deficiency is primarily caused by a G→A point mutation in intron 6 of the C8A gene, creating a new splice site that results in a 10-nucleotide insertion in the mRNA. This insertion leads to a frameshift and a premature stop codon, preventing the synthesis of functional C8α protein or resulting in a dysfunctional protein. Consequently, individuals with this mutation exhibit absent or low hemolytic activity in their sera, increasing their susceptibility to infections, particularly recurrent Neisseria infections and pneumococcal bacteremia (Densen2020A).

C8α-γ deficiency is linked to a loss of serum bactericidal activity, which is crucial for innate immunity, and an increased risk of meningococcal disease. The C8 protein is part of the membrane attack complex, essential for complement-dependent bactericidal activity. Deficiencies in C8 components, including C8A, result in increased susceptibility to infections, particularly recurrent neisserial infections (Tedesco1990Two; Degn2011DiseaseCausing). The deficiency is predominantly found in African and North African populations (Tedesco1990Two).

## Interactions
The C8A gene encodes the alpha subunit of complement component C8, which is a crucial part of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the complement system. C8A interacts with C8B and C8G to form the C8 complex. This complex then associates with C5b-7 to form the MAC, facilitating cell lysis (Haefliger1991Structural).

C8A specifically interacts with complement component C9, enhancing the efficiency of cell lysis. This interaction is significant for the assembly of the MAC, as C8A induces C9 polymerization, which is essential for forming transmembrane channels that lead to cell lysis (Tschopp1986Antigenic; Esser1993Small).

C8A also interacts with CD59, a complement regulatory protein. This interaction has been studied in both humans and grass carp, with specific amino acid residues identified as crucial for the interaction. The docking sites and spatial conformations of the C8A-CD59 complex have been analyzed, revealing differences between species (Li2020Fish).

The C8A subunit contains a cysteine-rich domain that is shared with complement component C9 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, indicating structural similarities that facilitate these interactions (Tschopp1986Antigenic).
