# B3GNTL1

## Overview
B3GNTL1 is a gene that encodes the protein UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase like 1, which is involved in glycosylation processes. This protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the transfer of sugar moieties to proteins or lipids, thereby playing a crucial role in the modification and function of these biomolecules. The activity of B3GNTL1 is significant in various biological processes, including cell signaling and molecular recognition, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response (Zhao2022Characterization; Hansen2014A).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
B3GNTL1 has been identified as having clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene is one of 56 glycosylation regulatory genes related to prognosis in HCC, with significant differential expression observed between cancerous and normal tissues. Mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) in B3GNTL1 are significant factors affecting its expression in HCC, suggesting that these genetic alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease (Zhao2022Characterization). The study highlights the potential of B3GNTL1 as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in HCC, indicating its role in the tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration, which are crucial for understanding disease progression and therapy response (Zhao2022Characterization).

In the context of broader genetic studies, B3GNTL1 was included in a Functional Mutation Map of Glycogenes, known as GlyMAP, which catalogs nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) in glycosyltransferase genes. This research aims to identify functionally damaging nsSNVs that could lead to inactive enzymes, potentially contributing to diseases. Although the study primarily focused on other genes, B3GNTL1's inclusion underscores its potential relevance in glycosylation-related disorders (Hansen2014A).
