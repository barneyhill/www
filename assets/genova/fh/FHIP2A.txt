# FHIP2A

## Overview
FHIP2A is a gene that encodes the protein FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein 2A, which is a critical component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly facilitating the movement of transport intermediates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. It achieves this by interacting with the dynein/dynactin motor complex, thereby playing a pivotal role in the motility of Rab1A-associated tubular ER-to-Golgi transport intermediates along microtubules (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). FHIP2A predominantly forms complexes with Hook2, which is essential for linking dynein to these transport intermediates, although its interaction with Rab1A is likely indirect, suggesting the involvement of additional molecular interactions (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The protein is not involved in endosome-to-Golgi transport but is specifically associated with the ER-to-Golgi stage, highlighting its specialized role in cellular transport mechanisms (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Function
FHIP2A is a crucial component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex, which plays a significant role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the ER-to-Golgi transport pathway. It is involved in the motility of Rab1A-associated tubular ER-to-Golgi transport intermediates, facilitating their movement along microtubules through interactions with the dynein/dynactin motor complex (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). FHIP2A forms a complex predominantly with Hook2, which is essential for linking dynein to these transport intermediates, although the interaction with Rab1A is likely indirect, suggesting the involvement of additional molecular interactions (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

FHIP2A is not involved in endosome-to-Golgi transport but is specifically associated with the ER-to-Golgi stage, as evidenced by its colocalization with known ER-to-Golgi transport proteins such as GMAP210, SCFD1, and BET1 (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of dynein/dynactin-mediated transport processes, contributing to the specificity of dynein's cellular cargo transport through interactions with Rab GTPases (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
FHIP2A, a component of the FHF complex, interacts primarily with Hook proteins, particularly Hook2, to form distinct FHF complexes. This interaction is crucial for the formation of motile dynein/dynactin complexes, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments where FHIP2A showed a stronger association with Hook2 compared to Hook3 (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). FHIP2A is also involved in ER-to-Golgi transport processes, where it colocalizes with Rab1A, a small GTPase essential for this trafficking, although it does not directly immunoprecipitate with Rab1A, suggesting an indirect interaction (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

FHIP2A's interactome includes proteins involved in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport and ER-Golgi transport, such as TBC1D23, FAM91A1, and GMAP210, indicating its role in linking different cellular cargos (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The protein also forms complexes with Hook2 that link dynein to Rab1A-bound tubular intermediates, playing a significant role in the motility of these structures (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). FHIP2A's interactions are part of a broader mechanism that mediates cytoplasmic dynein-1 cargo diversity through the combinatorial assembly of FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).
