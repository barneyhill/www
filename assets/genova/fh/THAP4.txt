# THAP4

## Overview
THAP4 is a gene that encodes the protein THAP domain containing 4, which is a member of the THAP protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a THAP domain, a zinc-coordinating DNA-binding motif that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. The THAP4 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis, which are essential for organismal development and homeostasis (Sanghavi2019Classification). As a long THAP protein (lTHAP), THAP4 contains conserved alpha helical regions that may form coiled coil structures, facilitating protein oligomerization and potentially affecting gene expression regulation and signal transduction (Sanghavi2019Classification). While the specific molecular functions of THAP4 in normal physiology are not fully elucidated, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stressors (Giordano2014Chronic). Additionally, THAP4 has been implicated in oncogenic processes, such as gene fusions with VAV1 in peripheral T-cell lymphomas, highlighting its potential significance in pathological contexts (Abate2017Activating).

## Structure
THAP4 is a member of the human THAP protein family, characterized by the presence of a THAP domain, a zinc-coordinating DNA-binding motif. The THAP domain in THAP4 includes a C2CH motif, which is crucial for zinc ion coordination and DNA interaction, and typically folds into a β-α-β structure (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). The THAP domain also contains an AVPTIF box at the carboxy terminus, which directly interacts with DNA (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic).

THAP4 is classified as a long THAP protein (lTHAP) due to its extended length and conservation of specific amino acid residues in its alpha helical regions (Sanghavi2019Classification). The predicted alpha helical region of THAP4 spans residues 362-398 and is rich in leucine and hydrophobic residues, suggesting the potential for forming coiled coil structures, which may facilitate protein oligomerization (Sanghavi2019Classification).

The L4 region of the THAP domain in THAP4 contains two consecutive basic residues, Lys67 and Arg68, which are implicated in DNA binding specificity. However, the shorter length of L4 in THAP4 may result in weaker DNA binding affinity compared to other THAP proteins (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). The structural diversity and evolutionary adaptations of the THAP domain contribute to the functional roles of THAP4 in cellular processes.

## Function
THAP4, a member of the THAP protein family, is involved in transcriptional regulation within human cells. The THAP domain, a zinc-dependent DNA-binding motif, suggests that THAP4 plays a role in DNA interaction and gene expression modulation. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis, which are crucial for organismal development and homeostasis (Sanghavi2019Classification).

THAP4 is classified under the long THAP proteins (lTHAP), which are characterized by conserved alpha helical regions that may form coiled coil structures. These structures are important for protein oligomerization, a process that can affect gene expression regulation and signal transduction (Sanghavi2019Classification). Although the specific molecular processes involving THAP4 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its role in transcriptional regulation suggests it may be involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stressors (Giordano2014Chronic).

In pathological contexts, THAP4 has been implicated in gene fusions with VAV1 in peripheral T-cell lymphomas, indicating its potential involvement in oncogenic processes when aberrantly expressed or mutated (Abate2017Activating). However, its precise function in normal cellular physiology remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the THAP4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, although specific clinical significance is not fully detailed in the available literature. In the context of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, a study identified a missense variant in the THAP4 gene with a CADD score of 12, suggesting potential involvement in biological processes such as gliogenesis, cell adhesion, and transmembrane transport. However, the direct clinical implications of these mutations in relation to diseases were not specified (Zhu2024Preliminary).

In Alzheimer's disease research, THAP4 was identified as a gene with significant combined p-values in an integrated analysis of human genetic association studies and mouse transcriptome data. This suggests a potential regulatory role in gene expression related to amyloid-β accumulation, although the specific clinical significance of THAP4 mutations in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear (YamaguchiKabata2018Integrated).

Additionally, the VAV1-THAP4 fusion has been recurrently identified in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), where it contributes to oncogenic activity by replacing the C-terminal SH3 domain of VAV1, leading to increased activation of signaling pathways involved in T-cell transformation (Abate2017Activating; ElenitobaJohnson2018New).
