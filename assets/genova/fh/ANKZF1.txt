# ANKZF1

## Overview
ANKZF1 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and zinc finger peptidyl tRNA hydrolase 1, which plays a pivotal role in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway. This protein is categorized as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase and is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by managing stalled ribosomes during interrupted translation. ANKZF1's enzymatic activity involves cleaving the tRNA acceptor arm of stalled polypeptides, facilitating their release and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, thus preventing the accumulation of aberrant polypeptides that could lead to cellular dysfunction (Inada2019tRNA; Kuroha2018Release). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for recycling tRNAs, contributing to efficient translation and cellular homeostasis (Yip2019Mechanism). ANKZF1's function is particularly significant in protecting against mitochondrial toxicity and maintaining cell viability under respiratory conditions, underscoring its physiological importance in healthy human cells (Inada2019tRNA).

## Function
ANKZF1, also known as ankyrin repeat and zinc finger peptidyl tRNA hydrolase 1, plays a critical role in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by managing stalled ribosomes during interrupted translation. ANKZF1 functions as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, releasing stalled polypeptides from the 60S ribosomal subunit by cleaving the tRNA acceptor arm. This process releases ubiquitinated nascent chains linked to a short 3′-terminal tRNA fragment, facilitating their degradation by the proteasome (Inada2019tRNA; Kuroha2018Release).

The protein's activity is crucial for recycling tRNAs, allowing them to be reused for translation, and is regulated by factors such as NEMF, which delays tRNA cleavage to ensure sufficient ubiquitination (Inada2019tRNA). ANKZF1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to efficient translation and cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of aberrant polypeptides that could lead to cellular dysfunction (Yip2019Mechanism).

ANKZF1's function is particularly important in protecting against mitochondrial toxicity and maintaining cell viability under respiratory conditions, highlighting its physiological significance in healthy human cells (Inada2019tRNA).

## Clinical Significance
ANKZF1 has been implicated in several cancers, with its expression levels serving as a potential biomarker for prognosis. In colon cancer, high ANKZF1 expression is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, particularly in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) or MSI-low status. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker specifically for colon cancer, as it is not associated with survival outcomes in rectal cancer (Zhou2019High). 

In colorectal cancer, ANKZF1 is one of several transcription factors whose increased expression correlates with poor prognosis, indicating its role as a potential biomarker for patient survival rates (Sajadi2022The). ANKZF1 is also part of a glycolysis-related gene signature that predicts poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where its upregulation is linked to worse survival outcomes (Xu2020The; Kong2022Identification). 

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ANKZF1 is associated with splicing mutations, particularly in pediatric cases, although specific details about these mutations are not extensively documented (Zhou2023The).

## Interactions
ANKZF1, also known as ankyrin repeat and zinc finger peptidyl tRNA hydrolase 1, is involved in several protein interactions and cellular processes. It interacts with p97, a protein that plays a role in regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy (Kong2022Identification). ANKZF1 is also a component of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) complex, where it functions in the release of nascent peptide chains from the 60S ribosomal subunit (Lu2022Translational). This involvement in the RQC pathway suggests that ANKZF1 may participate in maintaining proteostasis, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Lu2022Translational).

In cancer, ANKZF1 is implicated in various signaling pathways, including those related to endothelial proliferation and cancer progression (Zhou2019High). Its expression is associated with poor survival outcomes in colon cancer, indicating a potential role in cancer signaling networks (Zhou2019High). Although specific protein interactions in cancer contexts are not detailed, its involvement in these pathways suggests that ANKZF1 may interact with other proteins involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
