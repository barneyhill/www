# PNO1

## Overview
PNO1 is a gene that encodes the protein partner of NOB1 homolog, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The PNO1 protein is characterized as a single-stranded RNA binding protein, containing two K homology (KH) domains that facilitate its interaction with ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These interactions are crucial for the processing and maturation of 18S pre-rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleoli of the nucleus, where ribosome assembly occurs, and is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in cellular function (Heuer2017CryoEM; Raoelijaona2018Domain; Zhou2004Cloning). PNO1's involvement in ribosome biogenesis and its interactions with other ribosomal proteins highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal cellular processes (Liu2020PNO1; Hu2019PNO1).

## Structure
The PNO1 protein, encoded by the human PNO1 gene, is a single-stranded RNA binding protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. It contains two K homology (KH) domains, which are known for their RNA-binding capabilities. The KH2 domain of PNO1 is particularly important, as it forms multiple interactions with rRNA, recognizing single-stranded bases and the stem of h45. This domain includes a GXXG-RNA binding motif that positions nucleobases in a hydrophobic pocket, facilitating its interaction with RNA (Heuer2017CryoEM; Raoelijaona2018Domain).

The primary structure of PNO1 includes a sequence of amino acids that results in a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa. It is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential function (Zhou2004Cloning). The protein localizes primarily in the nucleus, particularly in the nucleoli, and contains two putative nuclear localization signals at the N-terminal (Zhou2004Cloning).

In terms of quaternary structure, PNO1 interacts with hNob1, forming a complex that is crucial for the maturation of 18S pre-rRNA. This interaction involves the KH-like domain of PNO1 and a conserved sequence in hNob1, highlighting the importance of specific conserved sequences for their binding (Raoelijaona2018Domain).

## Function
PNO1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. In healthy human cells, PNO1 plays a crucial role in the processing of pre-rRNA, particularly in the cleavage at the 3' end of 18S pre-rRNA, which is essential for the formation of functional ribosomes (Liu2020PNO1; Hu2019PNO1). This process is vital for efficient protein synthesis and cellular growth, as ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins.

PNO1 is localized to the nucleus, particularly within the nucleoli, where ribosome assembly occurs (Lin2019Importance). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function (Liu2020PNO1). Although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully explored, its involvement in ribosome biogenesis suggests a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal cellular processes.

PNO1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney, but is absent in the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, pancreas, and prostate (Hu2019PNO1). Its expression pattern and essential role in ribosome assembly underscore its importance in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PNO1 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PNO1 is overexpressed, which is associated with increased tumor size, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced autophagy, indicating its oncogenic potential. High PNO1 expression correlates with poor prognosis, including lower overall survival and disease-free survival rates in HCC patients. PNO1 promotes HCC cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through the MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that targeting PNO1 could be a therapeutic strategy for HCC (Han2021PNO1).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PNO1 is also overexpressed and linked to poor patient survival. It is negatively regulated by miR-340-5p, and its overexpression promotes cancer progression through the Notch signaling pathway, which is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This makes PNO1 a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in LUAD (Liu2020PNO1).

In bladder urothelial carcinoma, PNO1 expression is higher in high-grade tumors. Knockdown of PNO1 reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor growth and survival (Lin2019Importance). These findings suggest that PNO1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a target for novel therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PNO1, a partner of NOB1, is involved in several critical interactions essential for ribosome biogenesis. It forms a complex with NOB1, which is crucial for the maturation of the 18S rRNA, a component of the small ribosomal subunit. This interaction is mediated by specific domains in both proteins, with the KH-like domain of PNO1 playing a significant role (Sloan2019Interactions; Raoelijaona2018Domain). PNO1 also interacts with ribosomal proteins such as Rps5 and Rps14, which are necessary for the Nob1-dependent cleavage step during ribosome assembly (Campbell2011ProteinProtein).

PNO1 is part of a core module with NOB1 and RIO2, which is highly interconnected and essential for ribosome assembly. This module is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis (Campbell2011ProteinProtein). PNO1 also binds cooperatively with NOB1 to specific regions of the 18S rRNA, suggesting a coordinated role in rRNA maturation (Sloan2019Interactions).

Using TurboID proximity labeling technology, PNO1 was found to interact with numerous proteins involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA translation and RNA metabolism, highlighting its broader functional roles beyond ribosome assembly (Xu2024the).
