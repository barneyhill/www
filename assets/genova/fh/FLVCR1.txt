# FLVCR1

## Overview
The FLVCR1 gene encodes the FLVCR choline and heme transporter 1, a transmembrane protein that belongs to the SLC49 Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis by facilitating the transport of heme and choline across cellular membranes. The FLVCR1 gene produces multiple isoforms, including FLVCR1a, which is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in heme export, and FLVCR1b, a mitochondrial heme exporter. These isoforms are essential for processes such as erythropoiesis and lipid metabolism, impacting cellular differentiation and iron balance (Chiabrando2012The; Fiorito2024Unearthing). Mutations in FLVCR1 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its significance in human health (Fiorito2024Unearthing; Yusuf2017A).

## Structure
The FLVCR1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SLC49 Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters, characterized by a common structural fold despite substrate specificity heterogeneity. The FLVCR1a isoform is approximately 560 amino acids long and features 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains and 6 hydrophilic extracellular loops, with both the amino and carboxyl termini located in the cytosol (Fiorito2024Unearthing). The protein has three N-glycosylation sites, two in the third extracellular domain and one in the transmembrane domain 11. It also contains putative sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation, casein kinase II phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation (Fiorito2024Unearthing).

The transmembrane helices are organized into two structurally similar domains: the N-domain (TM1-TM6) and the C-domain (TM7-TM12), with the substrate-binding site centrally located and composed of residues from both domains (Fiorito2024Unearthing). The operational mode of FLVCR1a is predicted to follow a 'clamp-and-switch' mechanism, typical for MFS transporters, which involves at least four conformational states and does not require external energy input (Fiorito2024Unearthing).

The FLVCR1b isoform, a mitochondrial heme exporter, is composed of six hydrophobic transmembrane domains and is likely to homodimerize to form a transporter with 12 transmembrane domains, similar to FLVCR1a, suggesting a quaternary structure involving dimerization (Chiabrando2012The).

## Function
The FLVCR1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transporter for both heme and choline, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. FLVCR1a, one of the isoforms, is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in exporting heme from cells, which is essential for preventing heme toxicity and maintaining heme homeostasis (Fiorito2024Unearthing; Chiabrando2016Mutations). This function is particularly important in erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production, where FLVCR1a helps regulate heme levels to support erythroid differentiation (Chiabrando2012The; Fiorito2024Unearthing).

FLVCR1 also plays a significant role in choline transport, which is vital for cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function. The protein facilitates choline uptake, impacting the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major component of cell membranes, and influencing lipid metabolism (Kenny2022Integrative). The dual role of FLVCR1 in heme and choline transport underscores its importance in cellular differentiation, metabolism, and maintaining cellular iron balance, contributing to overall organismal health (Fiorito2024Unearthing; Kenny2022Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the FLVCR1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its role in heme and choline transport. Mutations in FLVCR1 can lead to Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as conditions like Walker Warburg Syndrome (WWS), Posterior Column Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa (PCARP), non-syndromic Retinitis Pigmentosa (ns-RP), and Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy (HSAN) (Fiorito2024Unearthing). These conditions often involve progressive vision loss, sensory ataxia, and lack of pain sensitivity, with additional features such as scoliosis and developmental delays (Fiorito2024Unearthing).

In particular, FLVCR1 mutations are linked to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and PCARP. A specific splice-site variant, c.1092+5G>A, is associated with RP without posterior column ataxia, suggesting a novel phenotype (Yusuf2017A). The p.Tyr341Cys variant is another mutation linked to non-syndromic RP, characterized by classical RP features (Dockery2019A). FLVCR1 dysregulation is also implicated in metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes and various cancers, where its altered expression affects glucose metabolism and tumor growth (Fiorito2024Unearthing).

## Interactions
FLVCR1, a transporter protein, is known to physically interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). One significant interaction is with the protein CSE1L. This interaction was identified through mass spectrometry analysis, which revealed 28 specific FLVCR1-interacting proteins, with CSE1L being a notable downstream target gene. The physical interaction between FLVCR1 and CSE1L was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation assays in KYSE-150 cells, demonstrating that these proteins can coprecipitate, indicating a direct interaction (Zhou2021FLVCR1).

The interaction between FLVCR1 and CSE1L is functionally significant, as it appears to promote ESCC cell proliferation and migration. Knockdown of FLVCR1 results in decreased CSE1L expression, which can be counteracted by restoring CSE1L expression, suggesting that FLVCR1 may exert its effects on tumor growth and migration through CSE1L (Zhou2021FLVCR1).

Bioinformatics analysis has also identified other potential FLVCR1-interacting proteins, including HK1, TNPO1, and SEC61A1, although the primary focus has been on the interaction with CSE1L due to its significant impact on survival prognosis in esophageal cancer patients (Zhou2021FLVCR1).
