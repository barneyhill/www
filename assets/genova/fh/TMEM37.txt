# TMEM37

## Overview
TMEM37 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 37, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of ion channels, particularly those associated with calcium ions. The protein plays a crucial role in modulating calcium ion flow across cell membranes, acting as an inhibitory subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. This regulation is vital for various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and signaling (Solimena2017Systems; Chen2007Calcium). TMEM37's expression and function have been implicated in several cancer-related processes, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Song2019Epithelialmesenchymal; Gao2024The).

## Function
TMEM37, or transmembrane protein 37, is involved in the regulation of ion channels, particularly influencing calcium ion flow across cell membranes. It is suggested to encode an evolutionarily conserved inhibitory subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. In beta cells, TMEM37 plays a critical role in regulating calcium influx and insulin secretion. Acute depletion of TMEM37 has been shown to increase intracellular calcium levels and insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation, while its overexpression results in the opposite effect, indicating its function as an inhibitory regulator of calcium channels (Solimena2017Systems).

TMEM37 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, contributing to processes such as muscle contraction and neurotransmission, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling. Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, TMEM37's involvement in calcium channel regulation suggests it plays a significant role in cellular and organismal functions related to calcium ion homeostasis (Chen2007Calcium). The protein's activity in modulating calcium channels is crucial for various physiological processes, including insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, which is vital for glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (Solimena2017Systems).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM37 has been implicated in various cancer-related processes through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colon cancer, TMEM37 is identified as one of the 47 hub genes associated with prognosis and drug treatment prediction. The study by Gao et al. utilized mRNA expression profiles to construct a multi-gene risk model, highlighting TMEM37's potential role in cancer prognosis (Gao2024The).

In lung adenocarcinoma, TMEM37 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer progression and metastasis. It is identified as a regulatory hub within a gene module associated with early EMT markers, showing significant upregulation in cancer-associated fibroblast-treated cells (Song2019Epithelialmesenchymal).

TMEM37 is also noted in the context of gastric adenocarcinomas, where it is expressed more strongly compared to neuroendocrine carcinomas, suggesting a differential expression pattern that may contribute to the distinct molecular characteristics of these cancer types (MAKUUCHI2017&lt; Comprehensive; b&gt).

In breast cancer, TMEM37 is one of the top genes co-expressed with YTHDF1, a gene involved in mRNA metabolism and stability. This co-expression suggests a potential role in cancer immunity and prognosis (Luo2024YTHDF1’s). These findings indicate that TMEM37 may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.
