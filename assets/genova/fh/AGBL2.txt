# AGBL2

## Overview
AGBL2 is a gene that encodes the protein AGBL carboxypeptidase 2, a cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin. This protein plays a critical role in the detyrosination of alpha-tubulin, a process essential for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability, which in turn affects various cellular functions such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal signaling (Karaca2015Genes; Zhang2014Clinical). AGBL2's activity is particularly significant in the brain, where it is associated with maintaining normal brain structure and function, and its disruption has been linked to cortical dysplasia syndromes (Karaca2015Genes). The protein also interacts with other molecules, such as the tumor suppressor RARRES1 and latexin, influencing microtubule dynamics and autophagy, with implications for cancer progression (Wang2018AGBL2; Sahab2011Tumor).

## Function
AGBL2 (AGBL carboxypeptidase 2) encodes a cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically in the detyrosination process of alpha-tubulin. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of microtubules, which are key components of the cytoskeleton in cells. The detyrosination of tubulin by AGBL2 influences microtubule dynamics and stability, impacting cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal signaling (Karaca2015Genes; Zhang2014Clinical).

AGBL2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with microtubules, where it removes glutamate residues from polyglutamylated tubulin. This activity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of microtubules, which are involved in various cellular activities, including the maintenance of cell shape, motility, and the segregation of chromosomes during cell division (Karaca2015Genes; Wang2018AGBL2).

In the context of brain function, AGBL2 is implicated in maintaining normal brain structure and function, as its disruption is associated with cortical dysplasia syndromes, highlighting its importance in neurogenetic processes (Karaca2015Genes).

## Clinical Significance
AGBL2 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In HCC, AGBL2 is frequently overexpressed, correlating with larger tumor size, multiplicity, and advanced clinical stages. High AGBL2 expression is associated with shorter disease-free survival, making it an independent prognostic factor for poor survival. AGBL2 promotes cancer cell growth by enhancing autophagy and cell cycle progression, and by increasing the activity of Aurora A kinase, a key regulator of mitosis (Wang2018AGBL2).

In RCC, AGBL2 expression is linked with tumor grade and co-expression with RARRES1, a tumor suppressor gene. The combination of AGBL2 and RARRES1 expression is significantly correlated with tumor size, grade, necrosis, and stage, although AGBL2 alone does not have significant prognostic value in RCC (Peterfi2020Expression).

AGBL2 also interacts with RARRES1 in regulating the α-tubulin tyrosination cycle, which is crucial for microtubule dynamics. Alterations in this interaction can affect microtubule stability, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Sahab2011Tumor). These findings suggest that AGBL2 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
AGBL2, a cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate the α-tubulin tyrosination cycle. It interacts with the tumor suppressor RARRES1, forming a complex that influences microtubule dynamics by modulating the detyrosination of α-tubulin. RARRES1 acts as an inhibitor of AGBL2, reducing its activity and consequently affecting the levels of detyrosinated tubulin (Sahab2011Tumor). This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments, highlighting the presence of AGBL2 in the RARRES1 complex (Sahab2011Tumor).

AGBL2 also forms immune complexes with latexin, a known carboxypeptidase inhibitor, suggesting a regulatory role in the tubulin tyrosination cycle through this interaction (Zhang2014Clinical). In hepatocellular carcinoma, AGBL2 interacts with LC3A/B and detyrosinated α-tubulin, playing a significant role in autophagy regulation. This interaction is crucial for the formation and trafficking of autophagosomes (Wang2018AGBL2). These interactions underscore AGBL2's involvement in critical cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and autophagy, with implications for cancer progression and treatment.
