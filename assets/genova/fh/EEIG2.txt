# EEIG2

## Overview
The EEIG2 gene encodes the protein EEIG family member 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. EEIG family member 2 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The gene's expression and the protein's function are significant in understanding certain pathological conditions, as alterations in EEIG2 have been associated with various diseases. Research into the EEIG2 gene and its encoded protein continues to provide insights into its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
