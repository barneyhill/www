# TEX30

## Overview
TEX30 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 30, which is implicated in several cellular processes, including stress response and spermatogenesis. The protein is known to be a component of stress granules, cellular structures that form in response to stress and are involved in RNA metabolism and protein interactions (Zhao2024The). In the context of reproductive biology, TEX30 is considered a candidate gene of interest for its potential role in chromosome segregation and synapsis during spermatogenesis (GómezH2019The). Additionally, TEX30 has been identified as a significant prognostic factor in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Liu2019Identification). Despite these associations, the specific molecular functions and interactions of the testis expressed 30 protein remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its roles in various biological contexts.

## Structure


## Interactions
TEX30, also known as C13orf27, is a protein that has been identified as a constituent of stress granules (SGs) in TM4 cells under heat stress conditions. It co-localizes with G3BP1-GFP, indicating its involvement in the formation or function of SGs, which are cellular structures that form in response to stress and are involved in RNA metabolism and protein interactions (Zhao2024The). 

In the context of spermatogenesis, TEX30 is considered a candidate of interest for its potential role in chromosome segregation and synapsis, although specific interactions with other proteins in this process have not been detailed (GómezH2019The). 

TEX30 has also been identified as one of the top prognostic factors in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in cellular pathways related to cancer progression. However, the specific interactions or pathways involving TEX30 in this context are not detailed (Liu2019Identification). 

Overall, while TEX30 is implicated in various cellular processes, detailed information on its specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remains limited. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise roles and interactions in different biological contexts.
