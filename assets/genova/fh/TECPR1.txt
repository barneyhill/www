# TECPR1

## Overview
TECPR1 (tectonin beta-propeller repeat containing 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the autophagic process, particularly in the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The protein, also named TECPR1, is characterized by its structural complexity, featuring nine β-propeller repeats, a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, and several other functional motifs that facilitate its role in autophagy (Pan2019Structural). As a key player in cellular homeostasis, TECPR1 is involved in the conjugation of LC3/ATG8 to damaged lysosomes, providing E3-ligase like activity to the ATG5-ATG12 complex, which is crucial for lysosome repair and the prevention of harmful substance leakage into the cytosol (Wang2023TECPR1). Additionally, TECPR1 plays a significant role in aggrephagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting protein aggregates, which is particularly important in neurons to prevent the accumulation of neurotoxic aggregates implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Wetzel2020TECPR1). The protein's ability to interact with various autophagic components underscores its essential function in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential implications in clinical conditions associated with autophagy dysfunction.

## Structure
TECPR1 (tectonin beta-propeller repeat containing 1) is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains nine β-propeller repeats, which are involved in facilitating protein-protein interactions (Pan2019Structural). These β-propeller structures are a hallmark of the tecpr domains, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with other components of the autophagy machinery.

TECPR1 also features an internal ATG12-ATG5-interacting region (AIR), a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, and two dysferlin domains (Pan2019Structural). The PH domain is crucial for binding phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), which is present in phagophores and autophagosomes, and is essential for TECPR1's autophagic function (Wetzel2020TECPR1). The interaction between the AIR and the PH domain regulates the binding of the PH domain to PtdIns(3)P, which is critical for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Pan2019Structural).

TECPR1 also contains a LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is important for binding to LC3C, a member of the hATG8 family, and is involved in the recruitment of autophagosomes to lysosomes (Wetzel2020TECPR1). The protein's structure allows it to substitute for ATG16L1 in the conjugation of LC3 to damaged lysosomes, providing E3-ligase like activity to the ATG5-ATG12 complex (Wang2023TECPR1).

## Function
The TECPR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in autophagy, a cellular process responsible for degrading and recycling cellular components. TECPR1 is involved in the conjugation of LC3/ATG8 to damaged lysosomes, providing E3-ligase like activity to the ATG5-ATG12 complex. This activity is essential for the repair and removal of damaged lysosomes, preventing the leakage of harmful substances into the cytosol and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2023TECPR1).

TECPR1 also plays a significant role in aggrephagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting protein aggregates. It recruits LC3C autophagosomes to lysosomes, facilitating the degradation of these aggregates. This process is particularly important in neurons, where TECPR1 helps prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Wetzel2020TECPR1).

The protein contains several domains, including an N-terminal tectonin repeat domain and a central PH domain, which are involved in tethering lysosomes to autophagosomes. TECPR1's interaction with LC3C is mediated by its LC3-interacting region (LIR), which is crucial for its function in autophagy (Wetzel2020TECPR1; Wang2023TECPR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TECPR1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative conditions. TECPR1 is downregulated in neurons of patients with TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, which correlates with the accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates. This suggests that TECPR1 plays a role in clearing these aggregates, and its reduced expression may contribute to disease progression (Wetzel2020TECPR1). In neural stem cells, overexpression of TECPR1 has been shown to reduce neurotoxic protein aggregates, such as Huntingtin, indicating its potential neuroprotective function (Wetzel2020TECPR1).

TECPR1 is also involved in the autophagic degradation of damaged lysosomes. It provides E3-ligase like activity to the ATG5-ATG12 complex, facilitating the conjugation of LC3 to damaged lysosomes, which is crucial for lysosome repair and regeneration. Disruption of TECPR1 function can impair this process, potentially leading to cellular dysfunction and contributing to disease (Wang2023TECPR1). While specific diseases directly caused by TECPR1 mutations are not detailed in the provided context, its role in autophagy and lysosome function suggests that alterations in TECPR1 could be relevant in conditions related to autophagy dysfunction.

## Interactions
TECPR1 interacts with several proteins involved in autophagy, playing a crucial role in the recruitment and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. It selectively binds to LC3C, a member of the human autophagy-related 8 proteins (hATG8s), through a specific LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, W175AKI178, which is essential for its interaction with LC3C (Wetzel2020TECPR1). This interaction facilitates the recruitment of LC3C autophagosomes to lysosomes, promoting aggrephagy, a selective type of autophagy that degrades protein aggregates (Wetzel2020TECPR1).

TECPR1 also interacts with the ATG5-ATG12 complex, providing E3-ligase like activity that facilitates the conjugation of LC3 to damaged lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for the autophagic process and lysosome repair (Wang2023TECPR1). TECPR1 can recruit ATG5 to lysosomes independently of ATG16L1, indicating its potential to substitute for ATG16L1 in certain conditions (Wang2023TECPR1).

Additionally, TECPR1 binds to phosphoinositides, specifically PtdIns(4)P, through its PH domain, which targets it to lysosomes and plays a role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Wetzel2020TECPR1). This interaction is independent of LC3C recruitment, suggesting distinct functions for TECPR1 in autophagy.
