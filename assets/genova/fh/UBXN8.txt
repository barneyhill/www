# UBXN8

## Overview
UBXN8 is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 8, a transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. As a member of the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) protein family, UBXN8 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a pivotal role in protein quality control by facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins. This function is achieved through its interaction with the p97 ATPase complex, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rezvani2016UBXD; Yang2021Epigenetic). UBXN8 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression is often altered, impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Yang2021Epigenetic; Yang2024Exploring). The gene's involvement in these critical cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure


## Function
UBXN8, also known as UBXD6 or REP-8, is a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It is a member of the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) protein family, which is the largest known group of p97 cofactors. UBXN8 plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by tethering the p97 protein, a versatile ATPase complex, to the ER membrane via its UBX domain. This association facilitates the efficient degradation of misfolded proteins, maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (Yang2021Epigenetic).

In healthy human cells, UBXN8 is involved in regulating physiological processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. It has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor that functions in a TP53-dependent manner, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (Yang2021Epigenetic). The protein's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis is critical, as insufficient expression of UBXN8 can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, potentially inducing the unfolded protein response (UPR) or ER stress, which can affect the stability of TP53, a tumor suppressor protein (Yang2021Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
UBXN8 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the t(8;21) translocation, UBXN8 is epigenetically silenced through promoter hypermethylation mediated by the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein. This silencing contributes to leukemogenesis by inhibiting myeloid precursor differentiation and increasing proliferation (Yang2021Epigenetic). Restoring UBXN8 expression in these leukemia cells can induce cell cycle arrest, promote differentiation, and inhibit tumor growth, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Yang2021Epigenetic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, UBXN8 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitors such as TP53 and p21CIP1/WAF1. Low expression of UBXN8 can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, causing stress that may result in the degradation of p53, thereby affecting tumorigenesis (Yang2024Exploring). The role of UBXN8 in cancer progression highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, with its expression levels serving as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response (Yang2024Exploring).

## Interactions
UBXN8, a member of the UBXD protein family, is known to interact with the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP, a crucial component in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is facilitated by the UBX domain of UBXN8, which allows it to bind to p97, playing a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Rezvani2016UBXD). The interaction with p97 is important for maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis, although the specific protein interaction networks involving UBXN8 in these pathways are not fully understood (Rezvani2016UBXD).

In the context of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), UBXN8 is epigenetically silenced by the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein, which recruits DNA methyltransferases to its promoter region, leading to transcriptional repression. This silencing affects UBXN8's role as a tumor suppressor, as its expression can induce cell cycle arrest and promote differentiation in leukemia cells (Yang2021Epigenetic). While the specific interactions of UBXN8 with other proteins in its tumor suppressive functions remain unclear, its interaction with p97 suggests a potential involvement in protein homeostasis mechanisms that could be relevant in cancer pathways (Yang2021Epigenetic).
