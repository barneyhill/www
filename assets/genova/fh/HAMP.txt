# HAMP

## Overview
The HAMP gene encodes the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide, a crucial regulator of iron homeostasis in humans. Hepcidin is a small peptide hormone primarily produced in the liver, and it plays a vital role in maintaining systemic iron balance by binding to and promoting the degradation of ferroportin, an iron export protein. This interaction effectively reduces iron efflux into the bloodstream, thereby preventing iron overload and contributing to the body's defense against infections. Hepcidin is categorized as a peptide hormone due to its regulatory functions in iron metabolism. The expression of the HAMP gene is modulated by various physiological factors, including iron levels, inflammation, and erythropoiesis, through complex signaling pathways such as BMP/SMAD and JAK/STAT. Mutations in the HAMP gene can lead to disorders like hereditary hemochromatosis, while its expression levels have been implicated in the prognosis of certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Nemeth2004Hepcidin; Darshan2010Severe; Tang2022High).

## Structure
HAMP encodes hepcidin, a small peptide hormone crucial for iron regulation. The primary structure of hepcidin consists of 25 amino acids. Its secondary structure is characterized by the presence of beta-sheets and a hairpin loop. The tertiary structure of hepcidin is stabilized by four disulfide bonds, which are critical for maintaining its functional conformation. Hepcidin functions as a monomer and therefore lacks a quaternary structure. Common post-translational modifications of hepcidin include proteolytic processing from a larger precursor, which is essential for its maturation and activity.

## Function
The HAMP gene encodes hepcidin, a peptide hormone that plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis in humans. Hepcidin is primarily produced in the liver and regulates iron levels by binding to ferroportin, an iron export protein located on the surface of enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes. This binding leads to the internalization and degradation of ferroportin, thereby reducing iron efflux into the bloodstream and maintaining systemic iron balance (Nemeth2004Hepcidin; Jacolot2004HAMP).

Hepcidin expression is influenced by various factors, including body iron stores, inflammation, and erythropoiesis. In response to increased iron levels or inflammation, hepcidin production is upregulated, which helps sequester iron within cells and limits its availability in the plasma. This mechanism is crucial for preventing iron overload and protecting against infections, as many pathogens require iron for growth (Darshan2010Severe; Nemeth2003Hepcidin).

In healthy cells, hepcidin ensures that iron absorption from the diet is balanced with the body's needs, preventing both iron deficiency and excess. Its regulation involves complex signaling pathways, including the BMP/SMAD and JAK/STAT pathways, which respond to changes in iron levels and inflammatory signals (Darshan2010Severe).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HAMP gene, which encodes the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide, have significant clinical implications. In hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), mutations in HAMP can exacerbate iron overload. For instance, the G71D and Met50del IVS2+1(-G) mutations in HAMP, when combined with mutations in the HFE gene, such as C282Y, can lead to severe iron overload conditions, including juvenile hemochromatosis (MerryweatherClarke2003Digenic; Jacolot2004HAMP). These mutations disrupt hepcidin function, leading to increased iron absorption and deposition in tissues, which can result in organ damage (Brissot2018Haemochromatosis).

In cancer, HAMP expression levels are associated with prognosis and disease progression. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high HAMP expression correlates with poor overall survival and is an independent prognostic predictor (Tang2022High). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reduced HAMP expression is linked to early-stage disease and better disease-specific survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Chen2023HAMP). In cholangiocarcinoma, low HAMP expression is associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis, highlighting its role in tumor progression and immune regulation (Wang2021Identification).

## Interactions
HAMP, or hepcidin antimicrobial peptide, is involved in several critical interactions that regulate iron homeostasis. Hepcidin binds to the iron exporter protein ferroportin, which is located on the surface of cells such as absorptive enterocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and placental cells. This binding induces the internalization and degradation of ferroportin, thereby reducing iron export from cells and maintaining iron balance in the body (Nemeth2004Hepcidin).

Prohepcidin, the precursor form of hepcidin, has been shown to interact with the promoter region of its own gene, HAMP. It binds specifically to a STAT3 site within the HAMP promoter, suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism where prohepcidin can down-regulate its own expression by binding to its promoter (Pandur2013Prohepcidin). This interaction is disrupted when prohepcidin is bound to alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), indicating that A1AT sequestration prevents prohepcidin from regulating HAMP gene expression (Pandur2013Prohepcidin).

These interactions highlight the dual role of hepcidin and its precursor in both regulating iron efflux through ferroportin and modulating its own expression through promoter binding.
