# AMBRA1

## Overview
AMBRA1 (autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. The AMBRA1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including a WD40 domain and intrinsically disordered regions, which facilitate its role as a molecular hub in various cellular processes (Wang2024AMBRA1:; Liu2023Structure). Functionally, AMBRA1 is pivotal in autophagy regulation, cell cycle control, and mitophagy, interacting with key proteins such as Beclin-1, ULK1, and PARKIN to maintain cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Cianfanelli2015Ambra1; Maiani2021AMBRA1). Clinically, mutations in the AMBRA1 gene have been associated with a range of conditions, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neural tube defects, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (La2019Neurodevelopmental; Revathidevi2022AMBRA1).

## Structure
AMBRA1 is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes a WD40 domain, which is a seven-blade β-propeller structure. This domain is split into two parts: WD40-N and WD40-C. The WD40-N includes Blades I-III and the first two strands of Blade IV, while the WD40-C contributes to the latter two strands of Blade IV and the remaining Blades V-VII. This split domain must reunite to form a functional substrate receptor, which is crucial for its interaction with the CRL4 E3 ligase complex (Liu2022Structural; Liu2023Structure).

AMBRA1 also contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that provide conformational flexibility, allowing it to interact with various partners. These IDRs are essential for the protein's role as a molecular hub in cellular processes like autophagy and cell cycle regulation (Wang2024AMBRA1:; Liu2023Structure).

The protein features an N-terminal helix-loop-helix motif, which is critical for its interaction with DDB1, a component of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is stabilized by hydrophobic and ionic interactions (Liu2022Structural; Liu2023Structure).

AMBRA1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by ULK1, which influences its subcellular localization and function in autophagy (Wang2024AMBRA1:). The protein can also be ubiquitinated and degraded by the CUL4-DDB1 and RNF2 E3 ligase complexes (Wang2024AMBRA1:).

## Function
AMBRA1 (autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1) is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, AMBRA1 is part of a complex with Beclin-1 and PI3KIII, which is essential for autophagosome formation. Upon autophagy induction, AMBRA1 translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the formation of autophagosomes by regulating ULK1 activity and stability (Antonioli2014AMBRA1; Cianfanelli2015Ambra1).

AMBRA1 also plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by mediating the degradation of D-type cyclins, thus preventing replication stress and maintaining genomic integrity. This function is vital for the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, which is crucial for DNA replication and cell division (Maiani2021AMBRA1).

In addition to its role in autophagy and cell cycle regulation, AMBRA1 is involved in mitophagy, a selective autophagy process for damaged mitochondria, by interacting with proteins such as PARKIN and LC3 to enhance mitochondrial clearance (Cianfanelli2015Ambra1). These activities underscore AMBRA1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AMBRA1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder, the Q30R mutation in AMBRA1 has been associated with hyperproliferative potential, leading to benign hamartomatous lesions. This mutation disrupts the G1/S phase transition control, contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation (Revathidevi2022AMBRA1).

AMBRA1 mutations are also implicated in neural tube defects (NTDs), with specific missense mutations like p.Thr80Met and p.Leu274Phe affecting autophagy induction, a critical process for neural tube closure. These mutations have been identified in cases of meningomyelocele, encephalocele, and spina bifida (Ye2020Rare).

In cancer, AMBRA1 plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. Its expression is linked to tumor survival and progression, with decreased expression correlating with poor prognosis in certain cancers, such as breast cancer. Mutations in AMBRA1 can lead to chemoresistance by modulating autophagy, impacting treatment outcomes (Cianfanelli2015Connecting; Karabay2024Bioinformatic).

AMBRA1 is also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Alterations in AMBRA1 protein levels have been correlated with these conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopment (La2019Neurodevelopmental).

## Interactions
AMBRA1 (autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1) is involved in several key interactions that regulate autophagy and apoptosis. It interacts with BECLIN 1, enhancing the BECLIN 1/Vps34 functional interaction, which is crucial for autophagy. This interaction is facilitated by AMBRA1's ability to bind BECLIN 1 mutants, indicating that an intact BH3 binding site for BCL-2 is not required for AMBRA1 binding (Strappazzon2011Mitochondrial). AMBRA1 also competes with BCL-2 to bind BECLIN 1, suggesting overlapping binding regions (Strappazzon2011Mitochondrial).

AMBRA1 interacts with BCL-2, particularly the mitochondrial pool of BCL-2 (mito-BCL-2), and this interaction is disrupted upon autophagy induction. This suggests that BCL-2 binds AMBRA1 at the mitochondria to inhibit its pro-autophagic function (Strappazzon2011Mitochondrial). AMBRA1's interaction with BCL-2 is independent of BECLIN 1, and it can bind both wild-type and mutant forms of BCL-2 (Strappazzon2011Mitochondrial).

AMBRA1 is also involved in the regulation of mitophagy through its interaction with Parkin, where it translocates to depolarized mitochondria and activates the PI3KIII complex, contributing to mitochondrial clearance (Cianfanelli2015Connecting). These interactions highlight AMBRA1's role as a central regulator in autophagy and apoptosis pathways.
