# CD300LB

## Overview
CD300LB is a gene that encodes the CD300 molecule like family member b, a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. As a transmembrane receptor, CD300LB is involved in recognizing and binding to specific lipids, such as phosphatidylserine, which are externalized on the membranes of apoptotic or activated cells. This interaction is vital for processes like phagocytosis and cytokine production, contributing to immune homeostasis and the body's response to infections and inflammation (Clark2009The; Vitallé2018CD300). The receptor's involvement in immune regulation is underscored by its potential role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and its expression in macrophages suggests a function in the immune environment of the testes (Zhao2014DNA; Chen2023Identification).

## Function
CD300LB, also known as CD300 molecule like family member b, is a non-canonical immunoglobulin superfamily activating receptor expressed on the surface of various immune cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. It plays a significant role in modulating immune responses by interacting with phosphatidylserine and other ligands, which are translocated to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during cell apoptosis, activation, transformation, or infection (Clark2009The; Vitallé2018CD300).

In healthy human cells, CD300LB is particularly enriched in macrophages, suggesting its involvement in the immune environment of the testes and potentially in spermatogenesis (Chen2023Identification). The receptor is involved in controlling the biological function of dendritic cells and is associated with mediating inflammatory responses in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and heart failure (Chen2023Identification). CD300LB's role in immune regulation is further highlighted by its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, where it is overexpressed in CD4+ T cells (Zhao2014DNA).

Overall, CD300LB contributes to maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to infections or inflammation by influencing processes like phagocytosis, cytokine production, and cell signaling (Clark2009The).

## Interactions
CD300LB, a member of the CD300 receptor family, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate immune responses. It is known to form a complex with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which plays a significant role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced responses in myeloid cells (Vitallé2018CD300). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of inflammatory responses, particularly in the context of bacterial infections.

CD300LB interacts with adaptor proteins containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motifs (ITAMs), such as DAP12. This interaction facilitates the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt pathway, which is essential for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (Murakami2014CD300b). The association with DAP12 is mediated through a positively charged lysine residue in the transmembrane segment of CD300LB, which allows for efficient signaling and immune response modulation (Murakami2014CD300b).

The CD300LB protein also recognizes lipids like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine on apoptotic cells, aiding in their clearance by immune cells (Vitallé2018CD300). These interactions highlight the role of CD300LB in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.
