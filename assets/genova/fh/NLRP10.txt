# NLRP10

## Overview
NLRP10 is a gene that encodes the protein NLR family pyrin domain containing 10, which is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a pyrin domain (PYD) and a Nucleotide-binding and Oligomerization (NACHT) domain, but notably lacks the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain found in many other NLR proteins (Singh2018Membrane; Tee2013Domain). The absence of the LRR domain suggests a unique role for NLRP10 in immune regulation, particularly in modulating inflammatory responses. NLRP10 functions primarily as a regulatory protein, influencing immune pathways by interacting with key components such as ASC and caspase-1, and is involved in the regulation of cytokine release and T-cell responses (Xu2024NLRP; Vacca2017NLRP10). Its involvement in immune processes underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling inflammation and immune-related disorders.

## Structure
NLRP10 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and is characterized by the presence of specific domains that contribute to its function in immune response. The protein contains a pyrin domain (PYD), which is involved in protein-protein interactions, and a Nucleotide-binding and Oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which is crucial for its oligomerization and activation (Tee2013Domain). Unlike many other NLR family members, NLRP10 lacks the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is typically involved in ligand sensing and pathogen recognition (Krishnaswamy2015Coincidental; Singh2018Membrane).

The absence of the LRR domain suggests a unique regulatory role for NLRP10 in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in inflammation (Singh2018Membrane). The PYD domain of NLRP10 has been structurally characterized using 3D NMR, with the solved structure available under PDBe ID 2m5v, which has been used for docking studies to predict protein-protein interactions (Singh2018Membrane). The structural analysis of NLRP10, including computational modeling and visualization techniques, aims to enhance the understanding of its role in immunologic defense and its structural characteristics (Tee2013Domain). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of NLRP10 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NLRP10, also known as NOD8, PAN5, or PYNOD, is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses in human cells. Unlike other NLRP proteins, NLRP10 lacks the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is typically necessary for forming inflammasome complexes, suggesting it may function independently of inflammasomes (Xu2024NLRP). NLRP10 is thought to act as a regulator or adaptor rather than a sensor of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It negatively regulates inflammasome activation and associated cell death by inhibiting ASC-mediated NF-κB activation and preventing IL-1β release through the inhibition of caspase-1-mediated maturation of IL-1β (Imamura2010AntiInflammatory; Xu2024NLRP).

NLRP10 is also involved in enhancing CD4+ T-cell-mediated IFNγ responses by regulating IL-12 release from dendritic cells (DCs). This regulation is crucial for optimal IFNγ production, which is important for Th1 cell responses (Vacca2017NLRP10). In the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, NLRP10 modulates the production of bioactive IL-12p70, which is essential for a protective Th1-cell-mediated immune response (Vacca2017NLRP10). NLRP10's role in immune regulation highlights its potential as a target for anti-inflammatory strategies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NLRP10 gene have been linked to various inflammatory and immune-related conditions. NLRP10 plays a critical role in regulating immune responses, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and inflammatory diseases. In murine models, NLRP10 deficiency has been associated with increased inflammatory responses and impaired resolution of lesions in cutaneous leishmaniasis, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role for the gene (Clay2017An). NLRP10-deficient mice also exhibit increased susceptibility to systemic Candida albicans infections, with defects in Th1 and Th17 responses, indicating its importance in adaptive immunity against fungal infections (Joly2012Cutting).

In the context of ischemic stroke, NLRP10 has been shown to play a pro-inflammatory role, with its ablation leading to reduced neuroinflammation and improved outcomes in ischemia/reperfusion-associated brain injury (Li2020NLRP10). Additionally, NLRP10 is involved in the regulation of dendritic cell migration, and its deficiency, often linked with a coincidental DOCK8 mutation, results in impaired immune responses due to defective dendritic cell function (Krishnaswamy2015Coincidental). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NLRP10 in various immune and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
NLRP10 is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune responses. It interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1, although no strong direct interaction was found in a yeast two-hybrid screen. NLRP10 can bind overexpressed ASC and caspase-1 in human epithelial cells, suggesting a role in inflammasome regulation (Lautz2012NLRP10). In the context of bacterial infections, NLRP10 enhances pro-inflammatory responses by interacting with components of the NOD1 signaling pathway, including RIP2, TAK1, and NEMO. These interactions suggest that NLRP10 acts as a scaffold to recruit and stabilize the active NOD1-Nodosome complex, amplifying NOD1-mediated signaling (Lautz2012NLRP10).

In the presence of cigarette smoke extract, NLRP10 is recruited to membrane microdomains, potentially interacting with lipid raft proteins such as caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, although direct physical interactions were not confirmed (Singh2018Membrane). NLRP10's interaction with ASC is also influenced by its pyrin domain (PYD), which has a distinct conformation in humans compared to mice, affecting its ability to inhibit ASC aggregation and procaspase-1 processing (Su2013ThreeDimensional).
