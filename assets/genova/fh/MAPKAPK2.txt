# MAPKAPK2

## Overview
MAPKAPK2, or Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated Protein Kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in cellular stress and inflammatory responses. The protein, commonly referred to as MAPK activated protein kinase 2, is a crucial component of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway, which regulates various cellular processes, including cytokine production, mRNA stabilization, and autophagy. As a kinase, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates a range of substrates, influencing their activity and stability, thereby playing a significant role in mediating cellular responses to stress and inflammation. The protein's activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation, and it interacts with several other proteins, such as p38α MAPK and 14-3-3 proteins, to execute its functions. Alterations in the MAPKAPK2 gene have been linked to various diseases, including invasive aspergillosis, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and multiple myeloma, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression and immune response modulation (Soni2019MAPKAPK2; SánchezMaldonado2020Polymorphisms; Cargnello2011Activation).

## Structure
MAPKAPK2, also known as MAPK activated protein kinase 2, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cellular stress and inflammatory responses. The primary structure of MAPKAPK2 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein's backbone. Its secondary structure includes a standard two-lobe kinase architecture, with the kinase domain adopting an active conformation even when unphosphorylated (Meng2002Structure). The tertiary structure features a kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain, which forms a helix-turn-helix structure plus a long strand (Meng2002Structure). 

The C-terminal regulatory domain contains two phosphorylation sites, Thr 334 and Thr 338, which are crucial for regulating catalytic activity and nuclear export (Meng2002Structure). Phosphorylation of threonine 334 acts as a switch for nuclear import and export, facilitating the transport of p38 to the cytoplasm (Meng2002Structure). MAPKAPK2 does not form dimers in solution, indicating a lack of quaternary structure involving dimerization (Meng2002Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating MAPKAPK2's activity and function. The protein is involved in phosphorylating various nuclear and cytoplasmic targets, highlighting its role in signal transduction pathways (Meng2002Structure).

## Function
MAPKAPK2 (MAPK activated protein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation. It is activated by the p38 MAP kinase and is involved in various molecular processes, including cytokine production, mRNA stabilization, and autophagy. In healthy human cells, MAPKAPK2 forms a stable complex with p38α, which stabilizes both proteins and facilitates their functions in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Cargnello2011Activation).

MAPKAPK2 is involved in the regulation of cytokine production by controlling the translation and stability of mRNAs for TNF-α and IL-6, which are essential for the inflammatory response (Cargnello2011Activation). It also plays a role in mRNA stabilization through the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which targets AU-rich elements in mRNA transcripts, crucial for the expression of inflammatory mediators (Winzen1999The).

Additionally, MAPKAPK2 is implicated in autophagy regulation, particularly during amino acid starvation. It phosphorylates Beclin 1 at serine 90, a key step in activating autophagy, which is vital for cell survival under nutrient deprivation (Wei2015The). This phosphorylation is also linked to the tumor suppressor function of Beclin 1, highlighting MAPKAPK2's role in cellular stress responses (Wei2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the MAPKAPK2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including invasive aspergillosis (IA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and multiple myeloma (MM). Polymorphisms within the MAPKAPK2 gene, such as the rs12137965G and rs11119267C alleles, are associated with an increased risk of developing IA, while the rs17013271T allele is linked to a decreased risk. These genetic variations may influence immune responses by affecting immune cell populations and cytokine levels, contributing to IA susceptibility (SánchezMaldonado2020Polymorphisms).

In the context of cancer, MAPKAPK2 is overexpressed in HNSCC, where it regulates transcript stability, affecting genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Knockdown of MAPKAPK2 in HNSCC cells results in reduced tumor progression, highlighting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Soni2019MAPKAPK2). Similarly, MAPKAPK2 is upregulated in MM, where it is associated with early disease development and poor prognosis. Its overexpression is observed in a significant proportion of MM cases, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Felix2009SAGE). These findings indicate that MAPKAPK2 plays a critical role in the progression of these diseases through its impact on cellular processes and immune responses.

## Interactions
MAPKAPK2 (MAPK activated protein kinase 2) is known for its interactions with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses. It forms a stable complex with p38α MAPK, with each protein stabilizing the other, indicating a mutual dependency. This interaction is essential for the activation of MAPKAPK2, which is phosphorylated by p38α at specific sites, including Thr222, Ser272, and Thr334 (Cargnello2011Activation; Meng2002Structure).

MAPKAPK2 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle control and apoptosis. It phosphorylates 14-3-3 at Ser-58, affecting its dimerization and ligand-binding capabilities. This phosphorylation is p38 MAPK-dependent and has been shown to regulate the interaction of 14-3-3 with other proteins like Raf-1 (Powell2003Proteomic).

Additionally, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates heat shock proteins Hsp25 and Hsp27, which are involved in actin remodeling and cell migration. This phosphorylation affects the ability of Hsp27 to form oligomers, thereby influencing actin polymerization (Cargnello2011Activation). These interactions highlight the role of MAPKAPK2 in mediating stress and inflammatory responses.
