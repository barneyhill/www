# ADGRL3

## Overview
ADGRL3, also known as the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3, is a gene that encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family, specifically the Latrophilin3 protein. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a large extracellular region with multiple domains such as the Lectin, Olfactomedin, Hormone Binding, and GPCR Autoproteolysis Inducing (GAIN) domains, followed by a seven-transmembrane helix region. ADGRL3 is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a pivotal role in neurophysiological and neurodevelopmental processes, including cell-cell adhesion, neuron guidance, and synaptic plasticity. It interacts with various G protein-dependent pathways and is involved in critical protein-protein interactions that influence synapse formation and neuronal communication. Mutations and altered expression of ADGRL3 have been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), highlighting its significance in central nervous system development and function (Martinez2016An; Folts2019Adhesion; Vidal2022ADGRL3).

## Structure
The ADGRL3 protein, also known as Latrophilin3, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family. It features a large extracellular region (ECR) composed of several domains, including the Lectin (Lec) domain, Olfactomedin (Olf) domain, a stalk-like region, a Hormone Binding (HormR) domain, and a GPCR Autoproteolysis Inducing (GAIN) domain, which precedes the seven-transmembrane helix region (7TM) (Kordon2024Structural; Kordon2022Isoform). The GAIN domain is a conserved feature across aGPCRs and contains an autoproteolysis site that is cleaved during protein maturation, with the cleaved fragments remaining non-covalently connected on the cell surface (Kordon2024Structural).

The tertiary structure of ADGRL3 includes a compact multidomain module, with the HormR domain positioned close to the membrane and the 7TM region (Kordon2024Structural). The GAIN domain is composed of two subdomains: the N-terminal subdomain A with six α-helices and the C-terminal subdomain B with 13 β-strands (Kordon2024Structural). N-linked glycosylation sites at residues N843 and N817 are conserved within ADGRLs, potentially playing a role in maintaining the conformation of the GAIN domain (Kordon2024Structural). Alternative splicing of the Lphn3 gene, which encodes ADGRL3, results in different isoforms that affect the extracellular and intracellular regions of the protein, including the GAIN domain and the 7TM region (Wang2024Alternative).

## Function
ADGRL3, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3, is a critical component in various neurophysiological and neurodevelopmental processes. It is primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion, neuron guidance, and synaptic plasticity, which are essential during the development of the central nervous system (CNS) (Vidal2022ADGRL3). The protein is involved in modulating neuronal interactions and axon guidance, contributing to the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections (Vidal2022ADGRL3).

ADGRL3 interacts with several G protein-dependent pathways, including Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13, which are involved in synapse formation and circuit wiring specificity (Huong2023The). The protein's structure includes domains such as the hormone receptor domain (HRM) and the GPCR-autoproteolysis inducing (GAIN) domain, which are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling (Vidal2022ADGRL3). The HRM domain interacts with the Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), suggesting a role in insulin secretion regulation and potentially linking ADGRL3 to metabolic processes (Vidal2022ADGRL3).

In healthy human cells, ADGRL3 is integral to the membrane and participates in protein-protein interactions with various leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins, contributing to neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and long-term depression (Vidal2022ADGRL3). These interactions are vital for maintaining proper neuronal communication and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADGRL3 gene, also known as LPHN3, have been strongly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Variants within this gene, particularly those affecting an ultraconserved brain-specific enhancer known as ECR47, are linked to ADHD susceptibility. The risk haplotype, including variants rs17226398, rs56038622, and rs2271338, disrupts the binding of the YY1 transcription factor, leading to reduced ADGRL3 expression in the thalamus, a brain region implicated in ADHD pathophysiology (Martinez2016An). 

ADGRL3 is also associated with other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and substance use disorder. These associations are supported by genetic studies that highlight the gene's role in predicting ADHD severity and comorbidity with disruptive symptoms (Martinez2016An; Vidal2022ADGRL3). 

Animal models have demonstrated that loss-of-function variants in ADGRL3 result in abnormal dopaminergic brain wiring and ADHD-like behaviors, which can be mitigated with ADHD treatments (Folts2019Adhesion). These findings suggest that ADGRL3 plays a crucial role in the development and function of the central nervous system, influencing susceptibility to ADHD and related disorders.

## Interactions
ADGRL3, also known as latrophilin-3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and neural development. One of the primary interactions of ADGRL3 is with fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3 (FLRT3). This interaction occurs through the extracellular domains of both proteins, forming a high-affinity complex that is significant for excitatory synapse development. The binding interface is located on the concave surface of the FLRT3 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and the olfactomedin (Olf) domain of ADGRL3 (Lu2015Structural).

ADGRL3 also participates in forming a trimeric complex with FLRT3 and UNC5D, where FLRT3 acts as a bridge between ADGRL3 and UNC5D. This complex supports intercellular adhesion and is implicated in synapse formation and synaptic transmission (Lu2015Structural). Mutations in the binding interface of ADGRL3 and FLRT3 can disrupt these interactions, which are linked to conditions such as ADHD and cancer (Lu2015Structural).

Additionally, ADGRL3 interacts with other ligands such as teneurins, although the FLRT3-binding site on ADGRL3 is distinct from the teneurin-binding site, allowing for multiple simultaneous interactions (Lu2015Structural). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ADGRL3 in neural development and synaptic organization.
