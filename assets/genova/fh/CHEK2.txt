# CHEK2

## Overview
CHEK2 is a gene that encodes the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) protein, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. The CHK2 protein is integral to maintaining genomic stability by mediating cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. It is activated through phosphorylation by the ATM kinase, particularly at threonine 68, which facilitates its dimerization and subsequent activation. CHK2 phosphorylates several key substrates, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby stabilizing it and promoting the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Additionally, CHK2 interacts with other proteins such as BRCA1 and CDC25C, further contributing to its role in DNA repair and cell cycle control. Mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with an increased risk of various cancers, highlighting its significance as a tumor suppressor (Antoni2007CHK2; Zannini2014CHK2; Bartek2001Chk2).

## Structure
The CHEK2 gene encodes the CHK2 protein, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the DNA damage response. The protein consists of 543 amino acids and includes several key domains: the SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD), the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and the kinase domain (Boonen2021Functional; McCarthyLeo2024Comprehensive). The SCD, located at the N-terminus, contains phosphorylation sites crucial for activation by ATM kinase, particularly at threonine 68 (Boonen2021Functional; Berge2010Chk2). The FHA domain, spanning residues 92-205, is involved in phosphopeptide recognition and protein-protein interactions (Boonen2021Functional; McCarthyLeo2024Comprehensive). The kinase domain, extending from residues 212-501, includes the activation loop and is essential for CHK2's role in signal transduction (Boonen2021Functional; McCarthyLeo2024Comprehensive).

CHK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which is critical for its activation and function. Phosphorylation at threonines 383 and 387 within the activation loop is necessary for full kinase activity (Boonen2021Functional; Bartek2001Chk2). The protein can form dimers, a process facilitated by phosphorylation and necessary for its activation (Boonen2021Functional; Berge2010Chk2). Splice variants of CHK2, such as Chk2Δ4 and Chk2isoI, have been identified, some of which exhibit altered kinase activity and may impact the function of the wild-type protein (Berge2010Chk2).

## Function
The CHEK2 gene encodes the CHK2 protein, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) in human cells. CHK2 is activated in response to genotoxic stress and phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis (Chehab2000Chk2hCds1; Zannini2014CHK2). It stabilizes p53 by phosphorylating it on serine 20, which disrupts its interaction with Mdm2, preventing p53 degradation and allowing for the transcription of p53-dependent genes like p21 (Hirao2000DNA; Chehab2000Chk2hCds1).

CHK2 is involved in maintaining genomic stability by coordinating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair processes. It acts downstream of ATM and ATR kinases, linking them to checkpoint effectors and ensuring that DNA replication and repair are completed before cell division continues (Zannini2014CHK2; Bartek2001Chk2). CHK2 also phosphorylates other proteins such as BRCA1 and CDC25C, contributing to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (Bartek2001Chk2). In healthy cells, CHK2 helps prevent the propagation of damaged DNA, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (Bartek2001Chk2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer. Specific mutations, such as 1100delC and I157T, are linked to a higher susceptibility to breast and prostate cancer. The I157T mutation is also associated with increased risks of ovarian, colorectal, kidney, thyroid, and bladder cancers, as well as leukemias (Antoni2007CHK2). CHEK2 mutations are more frequent in breast cancer patients, particularly those with a family history of the disease, and are associated with a younger age of onset and increased risk of bilateral breast cancer (Stolarova2020CHEK2; Antoni2007CHK2).

CHEK2 mutations are also implicated in prostate cancer, with a significant proportion of patients carrying these mutations, especially in cases of metastatic disease (Stolarova2020CHEK2). In addition, CHEK2 is linked to renal cell carcinoma and Wilms tumors (Stolarova2020CHEK2). The gene is considered a low-to-moderate cancer predisposition gene, and carriers of pathogenic mutations may require intensified cancer screening and management (Stolarova2020CHEK2).

Alterations in CHEK2 expression or function can disrupt cell cycle control and DNA repair, contributing to tumorigenesis. These mutations may lead to unstable or inactive proteins, potentially contributing to cancer through haploinsufficiency rather than a dominant-negative effect (Antoni2007CHK2).

## Interactions
CHEK2, a serine/threonine kinase, is a critical component of the DNA damage response pathway, interacting with several key proteins to maintain genomic stability. It is activated by phosphorylation at Thr68, primarily by the ATM kinase, which is triggered by DNA double-strand breaks. This phosphorylation facilitates CHEK2 dimerization and activation through intermolecular interactions involving the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and the kinase domain (Cai2009Structure).

CHEK2 phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, at Ser20. This phosphorylation event disrupts the interaction between p53 and Mdm2, leading to p53 stabilization and activation, which is crucial for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Hirao2000DNA). CHEK2 also phosphorylates BRCA1, influencing DNA repair pathways by repressing non-homologous end-joining and promoting homologous recombination (Roeb2012Response).

In the S-phase checkpoint, CHEK2 phosphorylates Cdc25A, leading to its degradation and subsequent inhibition of Cdk2 activity, thereby halting DNA synthesis (Falck2001The). CHEK2's interactions with these proteins underscore its role as a tumor suppressor and a key regulator of the DNA damage response.
