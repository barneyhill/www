# RALY

## Overview
The RALY gene encodes the RALY heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism and regulation. This RNA-binding protein is characterized by an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and a glycine-rich region (GRR), facilitating its involvement in RNA processing, splicing, translation, and transport (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide; Rossi2017Identification). RALY is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it associates with polyribosomes and ribonucleoprotein complexes, influencing RNA stability and expression (Gasperini2018The). The protein's interactions with other hnRNPs and its role in regulating the expression of enzymes like PRMT1 underscore its importance in maintaining cellular function and preventing neurodegenerative disorders (Gasperini2018The). Additionally, RALY's altered expression is linked to various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Gasperini2018The; Rossi2017Identification).

## Structure
The RALY protein is a human RNA-binding protein characterized by specific structural motifs. It consists of 306 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 36 kDa and shares 87.5% identity with its murine homolog (Rossi2017Identification). The primary structure includes an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) located at the N-terminal region, which is crucial for its RNA-binding capability (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide; Rossi2017Identification). The RRM shares 43% homology with hnRNP C (Rossi2017Identification). 

The protein also contains a glycine-rich region (GRR) at the C-terminal region, although its function remains unclear (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide). This GRR domain is not necessary for RALY's localization to the nuclear compartment or for its RNA-binding activity, but it is required for specific protein interactions, such as with ELAVL1 (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide). RALY has two predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS), suggesting its potential role in nuclear transport (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide). 

RALY is involved in forming ribonucleoprotein complexes and is associated with RNA transport, translational control, and non-sense mediated decay (Rossi2017Identification). The protein's interaction with other proteins, such as FUS, suggests a role in neurodegenerative diseases (Gasperini2018The).

## Function
The RALY gene encodes a protein that is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which is involved in RNA processing and regulation. In healthy human cells, RALY plays a significant role in RNA metabolism, including RNA processing, splicing, translation, and transport (Gasperini2018The; Rossi2017Identification). It binds preferentially to poly-U stretches within the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts, influencing RNA stability and expression (Gasperini2018The).

RALY is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it associates with polyribosomes and ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) (Gasperini2018The). It regulates the expression of PRMT1, an enzyme responsible for protein arginine methylation, which affects the localization and function of nuclear RNA-binding proteins like FUS (Gasperini2018The). This regulation is crucial for preventing the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates associated with neurodegenerative disorders (Gasperini2018The).

RALY's interaction with specific mRNAs and proteins suggests its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Rossi2017Identification). Its role in RNA metabolism and gene expression highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and development.

## Clinical Significance
The RALY gene is implicated in various diseases due to its role in RNA metabolism and regulation. Altered expression of RALY is associated with several cancers, including ovarian, lung, bladder, brain, and breast cancers, as well as multiple myelomas and melanomas. Its upregulation in these tissues suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, possibly through the regulation of mRNAs like ANXA1 and H1FX, which are markers for cancer development (Rossi2017Identification). In lung cancer, RALY is involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis by mediating alternative splicing of specific isoforms (Wippel2021Deciphering).

In neurodegenerative diseases, RALY interacts with the FUS protein, and mutations in RALY can lead to its delocalization, affecting FUS's binding to mRNAs crucial for neuron physiology. This interaction is significant in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where RALY mutations may contribute to disease progression (Gasperini2018The). Additionally, RALY's involvement in Alzheimer's disease has been noted, where its expression is linked to cognitive decline and reserve phenotypes. Higher RALY expression is associated with slower cognitive decline, suggesting a protective role in Alzheimer's disease progression (Zhang2020Exploring).

## Interactions
The RALY protein, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. RALY interacts with numerous proteins, including MATR3, PABP1, and ELAVL1, primarily through RNA-dependent interactions (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide). It also forms complexes with other hnRNPs such as hnRNP C1/2, hnRNP F, hnRNP K, hnRNP L, hnRNP M, and hnRNP U, as well as ribosomal proteins (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide). 

The interaction between RALY and the ALS-linked protein FUS is particularly noteworthy. This interaction is RNA-dependent, as RNase treatment reduces their association, although the interaction with EWSR1 is not completely abolished, suggesting an additional protein-protein interaction (Gasperini2018The). RALY also interacts with the Drosha complex, facilitating miRNA processing through its binding to pri-miRNAs, a process enhanced by m6A methylation (Sun2020RNA-binding).

RALY's association with polysomes suggests a role in translation regulation, as it co-sediments with ribosomal proteins in polysomal fractions (Rossi2017Identification). These interactions highlight RALY's multifaceted role in RNA processing and regulation.
