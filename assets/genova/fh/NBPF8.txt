# NBPF8

## Overview
The NBPF8 gene encodes the protein NBPF member 8, which is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, a group of proteins characterized by the presence of DUF1220 domains. These domains are notably expanded in the human genome and are linked to advanced cognitive functions, particularly in the neocortex, a region of the brain associated with higher-order cognitive processes (Popesco2006Human). The NBPF8 protein is implicated in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, a critical cellular mechanism for maintaining mRNA stability and integrity, which is essential for proper neural development and function (Boehm2024Rapid). Through its involvement in this pathway, NBPF8 is thought to play a role in neural stem cell proliferation and brain development, underscoring its potential significance in human cognitive evolution and neurological health.

## Structure


## Function
NBPF8, a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, plays a significant role in brain development and cognitive functions. This gene is part of a family characterized by the presence of DUF1220 domains, which are highly expanded in the human genome and are associated with higher cognitive functions. These domains are expressed predominantly in neurons, particularly in the neocortex, a brain region linked to advanced cognitive abilities (Popesco2006Human).

NBPF8 is involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, regulated by the helicase UPF1. This pathway is crucial for maintaining the stability and integrity of the transcriptome by targeting mRNAs with premature termination codons for degradation. The regulation of NBPF8 by UPF1 suggests its involvement in neural stem cell proliferation and brain development, as UPF1-mediated degradation controls the expression of genes implicated in these processes (Boehm2024Rapid).

The NBPF8 gene is expressed during human corticogenesis, indicating its potential role in driving neural stem cell proliferation. The expression of NBPF8 and other NBPF family members is typically controlled by UPF1-mediated degradation, highlighting the importance of NMD regulation in human brain development (Boehm2024Rapid).
