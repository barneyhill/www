# PSRC1

## Overview
The PSRC1 gene encodes the protein proline and serine rich coiled-coil 1, which is integral to cell cycle regulation and lipid metabolism. This protein is primarily involved in mitosis, where it facilitates spindle assembly and chromosome segregation by interacting with microtubule depolymerases, thereby ensuring proper cell division and genomic stability (Tönjes2017Genomewide). Beyond its role in cell division, PSRC1 is part of the CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 gene cluster, which has been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) and lipid regulation, particularly influencing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1). The protein's interactions with other molecules involved in cholesterol metabolism, such as SORT1 and SORL1, underscore its significance in cardiovascular health (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1). Through its multifaceted roles, PSRC1 is a critical player in both cellular processes and broader physiological outcomes, particularly those related to cardiovascular disease.

## Structure


## Function
The PSRC1 gene encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It plays a crucial role in spindle assembly and chromosome segregation by recruiting and regulating microtubule depolymerases, which are essential for proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability (Tönjes2017Genomewide). PSRC1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the dynamic changes required for cell division (Influence; ALEitan2020&lt; p&gt).

In addition to its role in mitosis, PSRC1 is implicated in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health. It is part of the CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 gene cluster, which has been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and plasma lipid levels. The gene's expression is linked to lower levels of circulating lipids, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and reduced CAD risk (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1). PSRC1 influences cholesterol metabolism by affecting the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and transport, such as Srebf2 and Pcsk9, and may impact cholesterol efflux through actin polymerization (Wei2019The). These functions suggest that PSRC1 plays a significant role in both cellular processes and broader organismal outcomes related to cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
The PSRC1 gene is clinically significant due to its association with coronary artery disease (CAD) and cholesterol metabolism. Variants in the PSRC1 gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs599839 and rs646776, have been linked to altered plasma lipid levels and CAD risk. These SNPs are associated with lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, suggesting a protective role against CAD (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1; CastilloAvila2023Association). The expression of PSRC1 is higher in individuals carrying the minor alleles of these SNPs, indicating a potential regulatory role at the mRNA level (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1).

Alterations in PSRC1 expression have been observed in CAD patients, with lower expression levels correlating with increased disease risk (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1). The gene's expression is also linked to lipid metabolism, influencing cholesterol synthesis, homeostasis, and transport (Wei2019The). Overexpression of PSRC1 in animal models has shown effects on cholesterol metabolism-related genes, potentially impacting atherosclerosis development (Wei2019The). These findings highlight the gene's role in cardiovascular health and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PSRC1 (proline and serine rich coiled-coil 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and cholesterol metabolism. It interacts with proteins involved in lipoprotein uptake and transport, such as SORT1 and SORL1, which are significant in lipid regulation (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1). PSRC1 also interacts with proteins involved in mitosis, including CDCA3 and CDCA8, and is responsible for microtubule destabilization and spindle assembly, highlighting its role in cell division (Arvind2014CELSR2–PSRC1–SORT1).

In the context of cholesterol metabolism, PSRC1 affects the expression of several genes related to cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis, such as SREBP-2 and PCSK9, which influence blood cholesterol levels (Wei2019The). The protein's interaction with the MAPK pathway suggests its involvement in cholesterol regulation and reverse cholesterol transport (Wei2019The).

PSRC1 is also implicated in the regulation of Schwann cell proliferation through its interaction with the lncRNA loc680254, which acts as a microRNA sponge. This interaction affects the expression of mitosis-related genes, including PSRC1 itself, indicating its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways (Yao2021Loc680254).
