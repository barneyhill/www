# TBC1D5

## Overview
TBC1D5 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 5, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) primarily for Rab GTPases, including Rab7 and Rab7b. This protein is integral to the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly in endosomal and lysosomal pathways. TBC1D5 interacts with the retromer complex, a critical component in endosome-to-Golgi and endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking, thereby influencing receptor recycling and cellular homeostasis. Additionally, TBC1D5 is involved in autophagy, interacting with proteins such as ATG8, and plays a role in mitophagy, which is significant for maintaining mitochondrial function. The protein's structural features, including its TBC domain and unique insertions, facilitate its interactions with other proteins and complexes, underscoring its importance in cellular processes (Jia2016Structural; Borg2018TBC1D5; Popovic2012Rab).

## Structure
TBC1D5 is a protein that features a TBC domain, which is crucial for its function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases. The TBC domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the retromer cargo-selective complex (CSC), specifically binding to VPS29 and possibly VPS35, with a high-affinity interaction characterized by a K D value of 220 ± 10 nM (Jia2016Structural). Within the TBC domain, TBC1D5 contains two unique insertions, Ins1 and Ins2, which are critical for its interaction with the CSC. Ins1 is particularly important, as it binds in a surface groove on VPS29 through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Jia2016Structural).

The protein forms a hydrophobic cluster with VPS29, and this interaction is conserved across species (Jia2016Structural). The crystal structure of the TBC1D5-VPS29-VPS35 complex shows that TBC1D5 interacts with VPS29 through a region corresponding to Ins1, without directly contacting VPS35 (Jia2016Structural). The interaction with VPS29 enhances the GAP activity of TBC1D5 towards Rab7, which is essential for endosomal recycling of retromer cargoes (Jia2016Structural). The structural configuration of TBC1D5 in the context of its role in retromer-mediated trafficking is crucial for its function, although specific details about its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are not explicitly described in the available context.

## Function
TBC1D5 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular trafficking, particularly in endosomal transport. It acts as a GAP for Rab7 and Rab7b, small GTPases involved in endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. By promoting GTP hydrolysis, TBC1D5 inactivates Rab7 and Rab7b, which is essential for their proper cycling between the membrane and cytosol, influencing their localization and function (Jia2016Structural; Borg2018TBC1D5).

TBC1D5 interacts with the retromer complex, a key player in endosome-to-Golgi and endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Rab7 activity and the disassembly of the retromer from membranes, facilitating receptor recycling and maintaining cellular trafficking processes (Jia2016Structural). TBC1D5 is also involved in autophagy, where it interacts with mammalian ATG8 proteins, contributing to autophagosome formation and cargo selection (Popovic2012Rab).

In healthy human cells, TBC1D5's regulation of Rab7 and Rab7b is vital for endosomal transport, Golgi function, and autophagy, impacting processes such as receptor recycling, lysosomal function, and cellular homeostasis (Jimenez‐Orgaz2017Control; Borg2018TBC1D5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TBC1D5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TBC1D5 is significantly underexpressed compared to normal kidney tissue. This low expression is associated with advanced tumor stages, higher histological grades, and poorer patient outcomes, including overall survival and disease-free survival. TBC1D5 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting autophagy, which is crucial for reducing tumor progression and lipid accumulation in ccRCC. The gene's regulation of autophagy is significant in its ability to suppress ccRCC progression (Huang2024TBC1D5).

In ischemic/hypoxic cardiomyocytes, a decrease in TBC1D5 impairs retrograde transport, affecting the trafficking of lysosomal cathepsins. This impairment is linked to the blockade of the Rab7 membrane cycle, which is crucial for lysosomal function. The deficiency in TBC1D5 leads to decreased levels of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), resulting in abnormal distribution of lysosomal cathepsins and potentially contributing to lysosomal dysfunction in ischemic conditions (Cui2021Impaired).

TBC1D5 is also involved in the regulation of RAB7 activity, which is crucial for mitophagy. Alterations in TBC1D5 expression or function can impact processes like mitophagy, relevant to conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease (Jimenez‐Orgaz2017Control).

## Interactions
TBC1D5 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular trafficking. It acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab7b, a small GTPase involved in retrograde trafficking from late endosomes to the Golgi. TBC1D5 facilitates the conversion of Rab7b to its inactive GDP-bound form, which is essential for proper localization and function (Borg2018TBC1D5). TBC1D5 also interacts with the retromer complex, specifically with components like VPS35 and VPS29, to regulate Rab7b activity and promote GTP hydrolysis (Cui2021Impaired; Borg2018TBC1D5).

In ischemic/hypoxic cardiomyocytes, TBC1D5 is crucial for the proper inactivation and dissociation of Rab7 from endosomes, which is necessary for the recruitment and cycling of the retromer complex. A decrease in TBC1D5 impairs Rab7 membrane recycling and affects the trafficking of lysosomal cathepsins (Cui2021Impaired). TBC1D5 also influences the association between the retromer complex and microtubules, which is essential for the detachment of the retromer-cargo complex (Cui2021Impaired).

Additionally, TBC1D5 interacts with proteins involved in autophagy, such as MAP1LC3, ULK1, and ATG9, and is involved in the regulation of autophagy-related processes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Huang2024TBC1D5).
