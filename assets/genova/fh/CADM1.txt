# CADM1

## Overview
Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The CADM1 protein, also known as SynCAM1 or TSLC1, plays a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell adhesion and maintaining cellular integrity across various tissues, including epithelial and neural tissues. It is characterized by its three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail that contains motifs for protein-protein interactions (Baliova2020Comparison; Shirakabe2017Mechanistic). CADM1 is involved in numerous cellular processes, such as the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell migration, and signal transduction, through its interactions with other proteins and its post-translational modifications (Moiseeva2014CADM1; Huang2024Glycosylation). Clinically, CADM1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and genetic alterations can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Mazumder2011Alterations; Li2021Functional).

## Structure
The CADM1 protein, also known as SynCAM1 or TSLC1, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is composed of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) loop domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail contains two protein-protein interaction motifs: a juxtamembrane protein 4.1 binding motif and a C-terminal type II PDZ binding motif (Baliova2020Comparison; Shirakabe2017Mechanistic).

The primary structure of CADM1 includes 12 exons, with alternative splicing resulting in several variants, such as v8 and v8/9, which differ in their susceptibility to ectodomain shedding (Shirakabe2017Mechanistic). The secondary structure features beta-sheets typical of immunoglobulin folds, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these Ig-like domains, which are crucial for its adhesive properties (Huang2024Glycosylation).

Post-translational modifications of CADM1 include both N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation, which are essential for its function. N-glycosylation occurs on asparagine residues, while O-glycosylation involves threonine residues, particularly in the stalk region encoded by exons 8 and 9 (Kikuchi2012Expression; Shirakabe2017Mechanistic). These modifications influence CADM1's cell adhesion, migration, and shedding susceptibility (Huang2024Glycosylation).

## Function
CADM1 (Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion processes, particularly in epithelial cells and mast cells. In epithelial cells, CADM1 is crucial for maintaining cell structure and adhesion by forming complexes with proteins such as 4.1B and members of the MAGuK family (MPP1, MPP2, and MPP3). These complexes are essential for the recruitment of E-cadherin and ZO-1 to cell-cell contact sites, facilitating the formation of mature adhesion structures characterized by thick circumferential actin filament bundles (SakuraiYageta2009Tumor). CADM1's role in epithelial cells ensures proper localization of its binding proteins to the plasma membrane, which is critical for maintaining epithelial cell integrity (SakuraiYageta2009Tumor).

In mast cells, CADM1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton assembly and extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. It influences the adhesion of mast cells to both cells and ECM by modulating phosphotyrosine signaling and the polymerization of actin filaments, which are essential for integrin-mediated adhesion (Moiseeva2014CADM1). CADM1 also stabilizes the surface expression of the Kit receptor, which is involved in signal transduction to integrins, facilitating their interaction with ECM ligands (Moiseeva2014CADM1). These functions highlight CADM1's importance in cell adhesion and signaling, impacting cell survival and morphology.

## Clinical Significance
CADM1, also known as TSLC1, is implicated in various cancers and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In breast cancer, low CADM1 expression is linked to poor prognosis, especially in breast cancer brain metastasis, where it correlates with disease stage and tumor size (Li2021Functional). In malignant melanoma, CADM1 overexpression inhibits invasion and migration, with low expression associated with poor survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Hartsough2019CADM1). In lung adenocarcinoma, CADM1 is involved in the Hippo pathway, regulating cell proliferation and contact inhibition (Li2021Functional).

CADM1 is also significant in cervical cancer, where its promoter methylation is linked to early invasiveness and poor prognosis (Mazumder2011Alterations). In neuroblastoma, CADM1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with low expression correlating with unfavorable prognostic markers (Nowacki2007Expression). In aldosterone-producing adenomas, specific CADM1 mutations are associated with increased aldosterone production, affecting hypertension (Wu2023Somatic).

Overall, CADM1's expression and methylation status are critical in the progression and prognosis of these cancers, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target (Li2021Functional).

## Interactions
CADM1, also known as cell adhesion molecule 1, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. It forms a multiprotein complex with MPP3, Dlg, and the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, which is essential for cell spreading mediated by the PI3K pathway. MPP3 and Dlg act as connectors between CADM1 and PI3K, facilitating the recruitment of PI3K to cell-cell contact sites in epithelial cells (Murakami2014TransHomophilic).

CADM1 also interacts with MUPP1, a scaffold protein containing multiple PDZ domains, through its PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is significant in the cerebellum, where CADM1 forms a complex with MUPP1 and GABBR2, a gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor, at the post-synaptic membrane. This complex is involved in synaptic organization and is thought to stabilize neurotransmitter receptor clusters (Fujita2012A).

In pancreatic islet β-cells, CADM1 interacts with components of the insulin secretory machinery, including CASK, Munc18, and syntaxin-1A. These interactions promote the assembly of submembrane secretory complexes, influencing insulin secretion (Zhang2016Extracellular). CADM1's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in cellular adhesion and signaling processes.
