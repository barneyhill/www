# AFG3L2

## Overview
AFG3L2 is a gene that encodes the AFG3-like matrix AAA peptidase subunit 2, a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. This protein is a part of the m-AAA protease complex, which is involved in the quality control and processing of proteins within the mitochondria. As a zinc-metalloprotease, AFG3L2 is essential for the degradation of misfolded proteins and the processing of specific substrates, contributing to mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory chain assembly (Puchades2019Unique; Almajan2012AFG3L2). The protein forms both homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric complexes, particularly with paraplegin, to execute its functions effectively (Maltecca2008The). Mutations in the AFG3L2 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) and spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome (SPAX5), highlighting its significance in neuronal health and mitochondrial dynamics (Cagnoli2010Missense; Ghosh2023Multifaceted).

## Structure
The AFG3L2 protein is a mitochondrial AAA+ protease that forms a homohexameric complex, crucial for its function in protein quality control within the mitochondria. The hexameric structure consists of two stacked rings: a planar C6 symmetric protease base and an asymmetric ATPase spiral. The ATPase domains are arranged in a staircase formation, with specific subunits binding to nucleotides such as AMP-PNP and ADP, facilitating substrate translocation and degradation (Puchades2019Unique).

The protein contains distinct ATPase and protease domains, with the ATPase domain featuring unique structural elements like pore-loop 2, which includes a four-residue insertion that positions the aromatic residue F421 closer to the substrate. This configuration is essential for substrate engagement and translocation (Puchades2019Unique). The protease domain contains six M41 zinc-metalloprotease active sites, each coordinating a zinc ion for catalysis, involving a conserved HEXXH motif (Puchades2019Unique).

The C-terminal residues (750-779) are crucial for stabilizing the hexameric complex and are positioned at the membrane-proximal face of AFG3L2, interacting with both the protease and ATPase domains (Puchades2019Unique). The structure of AFG3L2 also includes a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates phenylalanine residues, indicating substrate specificity (Puchades2019Unique).

## Function
The AFG3L2 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in neurons. This protease is involved in the quality control of misfolded proteins within the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a regulatory role by processing specific substrates (Almajan2012AFG3L2). AFG3L2 is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis, as it supports the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal components necessary for the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits (Almajan2012AFG3L2). The protein forms both homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric complexes with paraplegin, which are vital for its function in mitochondrial assembly and metabolism (Maltecca2008The).

In healthy human cells, AFG3L2 is particularly important for the survival of Purkinje cells, a type of neuron in the cerebellum, by maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and preventing degeneration (Almajan2012AFG3L2). The absence of AFG3L2 leads to impaired mitochondrial morphology and metabolism, affecting the nervous system and resulting in neurodegenerative conditions (Maltecca2008The). AFG3L2's role in mitochondrial function is underscored by its involvement in the assembly of respiratory complexes I and III, which are critical for mitochondrial metabolism and energy production (Maltecca2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AFG3L2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28). SCA28 is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by progressive incoordination, dysarthria, and impairment of eye movements, primarily affecting the cerebellum. The onset typically occurs at a juvenile age, with a mean onset age of 27 years (Edener2010Early). Missense mutations in the AFG3L2 gene, particularly in exons 15 and 16, are causative for SCA28, affecting the peptidase M41 domain of the protein (Cagnoli2010Missense).

AFG3L2 mutations are also linked to spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome (SPAX5), which can result from homozygous mutations and is characterized by early onset spastic ataxia and neuropathy (Ghosh2023Multifaceted). Additionally, AFG3L2 mutations have been implicated in optic neuropathies, such as dominant optic atrophy (DOA), where they affect OPA1 processing, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation (Caporali2020ATPase).

In Parkinson's disease, a unique frameshift mutation in AFG3L2 is associated with mild parkinsonism and cognitive decline, although its direct relation to the disease remains unclear (Ghosh2023Multifaceted). AFG3L2 mutations can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to various neurological disorders due to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and increased oxidative stress (Maltecca2009Haploinsufficiency).

## Interactions
AFG3L2 is a mitochondrial protein that forms part of the m-AAA protease complex, which is crucial for protein quality control and processing within mitochondria. It interacts with paraplegin (SPG7) to form hetero-oligomeric complexes. These complexes are involved in the degradation of misfolded polypeptides and processing of ribosomal subunits like MrpL32 and Ccp1 (Koppen2007Variable). AFG3L2 can also form homo-oligomeric complexes, particularly in the absence of paraplegin, as observed in brain mitochondria (Koppen2007Variable).

AFG3L2 interacts with other m-AAA protease subunits, such as Afg3l1 and paraplegin, forming complexes in both liver and brain mitochondria (Koppen2007Variable). In yeast cells, coexpression of AFG3L2 with paraplegin restores respiratory growth, indicating a functional interaction between these proteins (Koppen2007Variable).

The structural features of AFG3L2, including its C-terminus and pore-loops, play a crucial role in substrate processing. These structural adaptations are linked to the protease's ability to handle diverse substrates and are implicated in disease-linked mutations that affect AFG3L2's activity and stability (Puchades2019Unique).
