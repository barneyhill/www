# PRKX

## Overview
The PRKX gene encodes the protein kinase cAMP-dependent X-linked catalytic subunit, a member of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase family, which is distinct from the classical protein kinase A (PKA) isoforms. This kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and is particularly active in developing tissues such as the brain, kidney, and lung (Huang2016PRKX; Li2011PRKX). PRKX is notable for its ability to be activated at lower cAMP concentrations compared to PKA, and it plays a crucial role in endothelial cell functions, promoting vascular structure formation (Li2011PRKX). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathways, influencing gene expression and cell cycle regulation (Zimmermann1999PrKX). PRKX's interactions with various proteins, such as Pin-1, Magi-1, and Bag-3, further underscore its involvement in critical developmental and physiological processes (Huang2016PRKX; Li2011PRKX).

## Function
The PRKX gene encodes a novel catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase family, distinct from classical PKA isoforms. It plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. PRKX is highly expressed in developing tissues such as the brain, kidney, and lung, and is involved in the formation of epithelial tubular structures and ureteric bud branching, crucial for kidney morphogenesis (Huang2016PRKX; Li2011PRKX).

In endothelial cells, PRKX stimulates proliferation, migration, and the formation of vascular-like structures, essential for angiogenesis. It is activated at lower cAMP concentrations than PKA and promotes endothelial cell functions, contrasting with PKA, which inhibits vascular structure formation (Li2011PRKX). PRKX interacts with proteins such as Pin-1, Magi-1, and Bag-3, which are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, potentially contributing to its role in angiogenesis and development (Huang2016PRKX; Li2011PRKX).

PRKX is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathways, affecting gene expression and cell cycle regulation (Zimmermann1999PrKX). Its activity is regulated by interactions with the regulatory subunit type I (RIα) and is inhibited by the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (Zimmermann1999PrKX).

## Clinical Significance
The PRKX gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. PRKX is associated with kidney diseases, including Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). Abnormal activation of PRKX can lead to a cystic tubular phenotype in ADPKD, and its high expression is linked to kidney carcinoma, where it contributes to cancer cell migration and resistance to sunitinib therapy (Huang2016PRKX). PRKX is also involved in sex reversal disorders, which can occur due to abnormal interchanges between the X and Y chromosomes involving PRKX and its homolog PRKY. These interchanges can result in unbalanced Xp; Yp translocations, contributing to sex reversal (Huang2016PRKX).

In the context of cancer, PRKX's role in angiogenesis is significant, as it stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, processes essential for tumor growth and metastasis (Li2011PRKX). PRKX is also expressed in the human brain and may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders, although specific conditions are not detailed (Huang2016PRKX). Understanding PRKX's involvement in these diseases could aid in developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
PRKX, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts specifically with the regulatory subunit type I (RI) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, with its activity being inhibited by RI but not by the RII subunit. This interaction is reversible by cAMP, which causes PRKX to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Zimmermann1999PrKX). PRKX also binds to the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) with high affinity, inhibiting its phosphorylation activities (Zimmermann1999PrKX).

PRKX interacts with proteins such as Pin-1, Magi-1, and Bag-3, which are involved in angiogenesis, suggesting a role in endothelial cell functions (Li2011PRKX). It also interacts with the Rep proteins of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2), particularly Rep52, which significantly inhibits PRKX activity (Chiorini1998Inhibition). In black carp, a PRKX homologue interacts with TGF-b-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), modulating antiviral signaling pathways by promoting TAK1 degradation through a lysosome-dependent pathway (Yang2023PRKX).

These interactions highlight PRKX's involvement in diverse signaling pathways, affecting processes such as angiogenesis, immune response, and viral interactions.
