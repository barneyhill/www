# IL1RAPL1

## Overview
The IL1RAPL1 gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 1, a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in synaptic formation and neuronal connectivity. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature, featuring extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which are essential for its function in synaptic differentiation and stabilization (Jin2000Two; Montani2017The). IL1RAPL1 is involved in the formation of excitatory synapses through interactions with protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ), influencing synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Yoshida2011IL1). Mutations in the IL1RAPL1 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Pavlowsky2010A; Yasumura2014IL1RAPL1).

## Structure
The IL1RAPL1 protein is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family and is composed of 696 amino acids. It features three extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain (Jin2000Two; Montani2017The). The extracellular domain is involved in forming a trans-synaptic signaling pathway by binding to receptor tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ), which is crucial for synaptic differentiation (Yamagata2015Mechanisms). The intracellular portion includes a 150 amino acid C-terminal extension that interacts with neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1), regulating voltage-gated calcium channel activity and synaptic function (Montani2017The; Boraschi2013The).

The IL1RAPL1 protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms. A smaller isoform lacks the transmembrane domain, potentially corresponding to a soluble form of the extracellular domain (Carrié1999A). Post-translational modifications may include glycosylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in synapse formation and stabilization, contributing to cognitive processes (Montani2017The).

## Function
The IL1RAPL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in synapse formation and neuronal connectivity in healthy human cells. It is involved in the formation of excitatory synapses through a trans-synaptic interaction with protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ). This interaction is essential for presynaptic differentiation and the development of dendritic protrusions, which are critical for synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Yoshida2011IL1).

IL1RAPL1 is expressed in dendrites and overlaps with postsynaptic Shank1 clusters, indicating its involvement in synaptic structures. The extracellular domain of IL1RAPL1 is necessary for presynaptic differentiation, while both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains are required for spinogenesis and the accumulation of postsynaptic proteins like Shank2 (Yoshida2011IL1).

The protein also regulates the synaptic localization of PSD-95 and influences dendritic spine density, which are important for maintaining normal cognitive abilities and synaptic strength. IL1RAPL1's role in synapse formation and stabilization is mediated through interactions with various signaling pathways, including the RhoA signaling pathway, which affects AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic stabilization (Hayashi2013IL1RAPL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL1RAPL1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). IL1RAPL1 is an X-linked gene, and its mutations can lead to nonsyndromic forms of intellectual disability and are implicated in autism (Pavlowsky2010A; Yasumura2014IL1RAPL1). The gene's dysfunction is linked to impairments in synapse formation and stabilization, which are crucial for cognitive and behavioral functions (Montani2017The; Yasumura2014IL1RAPL1).

In individuals with IL1RAPL1 mutations, there is often a decrease in dendritic spine density and excitatory synapses, leading to deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairments (Pavlowsky2010A). Specific mutations, such as frameshift mutations, can result in truncated proteins that severely alter neuronal function, affecting neurite outgrowth and synaptic organization (Piton2008Mutations). These genetic alterations can manifest as a spectrum of phenotypes, from mild learning disabilities to severe intellectual disabilities and autism, with varying degrees of behavioral issues (Jin2000Two; Franek2011Deletion). The gene's role in regulating synaptic functions and its involvement in neurodevelopmental pathways underscore its clinical significance in these disorders.

## Interactions
The IL1RAPL1 protein interacts with several key proteins involved in synaptic function and cognitive processes. It is part of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family and interacts with PSD-95, a major component of the excitatory postsynaptic compartment. This interaction is crucial for synaptic localization and is regulated by the c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, affecting PSD-95 phosphorylation and dendritic spine morphology (Pavlowsky2010A). IL1RAPL1 also binds trans-synaptically to protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ) through its extracellular domain, which is essential for synapse formation. This interaction recruits RhoGAP2 to synapses, necessary for excitatory synapse formation and dendritic spine formation (Valnegri2011The; Yoshida2011IL1). The interaction between IL1RAPL1 and PTPδ is mediated by specific atomic-level interactions, including hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, which are critical for binding affinity (Yamagata2015Mechanisms). IL1RAPL1 also interacts with the neuronal calcium sensor NCS-1, affecting the activity of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which plays a role in neurotransmitter release (Pavlowsky2010A). These interactions highlight IL1RAPL1's role in synaptic organization and cognitive function.
