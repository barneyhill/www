# ZNF793

## Overview
ZNF793 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 793, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. ZNF793 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins, including KAP1 and SIRT1, to modulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Helleboid2019The). The gene has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including early-onset colorectal cancer and Barrett's esophagus, where alterations in its expression or methylation status may contribute to disease progression (Yu2015Methylated; Kramer2024Exploring). Despite its recognized roles, further research is necessary to fully elucidate the comprehensive functions and interaction networks of ZNF793 in both normal physiology and disease contexts.

## Function
ZNF793, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, is involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This regulation is facilitated through its interaction with KAP1, a central node in the protein interactome of KRAB zinc finger proteins, which often involves chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Helleboid2019The). ZNF793 is associated with SIRT1, a deacetylase, suggesting its involvement in processes related to deacetylation and chromatin remodeling (Helleboid2019The).

In the context of cellular processes, ZNF793 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription, as it is listed among genes associated with transcription regulation in studies examining gene expression profiles (Perez‐Añorve2019New). Although the specific molecular function of ZNF793 in cell biology is not fully detailed, its interactions suggest a role in maintaining normal cellular function and development through the modulation of gene expression patterns (Helleboid2019The). The protein's activity in the nucleus and its involvement in transcriptional regulation highlight its importance in cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF793 has been implicated in several cancers, particularly in early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). In EO-CRC, a homozygous deletion in the ZNF793 gene was identified, which overlaps an exon and suggests a potential tumor suppressor role. This deletion is associated with a progressive decrease in ZNF793 expression from normal colon tissue to adenoma and further to adenocarcinoma, indicating its involvement in colorectal cancer progression (Kramer2024Exploring).

In the context of Barrett's esophagus, ZNF793 is noted for its aberrant methylation, which is significantly higher in BE samples compared to normal tissues. This methylation status has been proposed as a biomarker for BE detection, with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% at a certain methylation cutoff. The methylation of ZNF793 is implicated in the early development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Grady2018Molecular; Yu2015Methylated).

Additionally, ZNF793 has been identified in studies of hereditary breast cancer, where a splicing variant with a high CADD score was noted, suggesting a potentially significant impact, although specific diseases or conditions associated with this variant were not detailed (Liu2022WholeExome).

## Interactions
ZNF793, a KRAB zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its functional roles in cellular processes. It is known to associate with SIRT1, a deacetylase, in the context of KAP1-mediated interactions. KAP1 serves as a central scaffold in the interactome of KRAB zinc finger proteins, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as HP1a, HP1c, and SMARCAD1 (Helleboid2019The). These interactions suggest that ZNF793 may play a role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling.

In the context of cancer, ZNF793 has been implicated in transcription regulation pathways, although specific protein interactions in this setting are not detailed (Perez‐Añorve2019New). Additionally, ZNF793 is frequently hypermethylated in gastric cancer, indicating a potential regulatory mechanism through DNA methylation, although specific protein interactions related to this process are not provided (Gómez2021FollowUp).

Overall, ZNF793's interactions with proteins like SIRT1 and its involvement in transcriptional regulation pathways highlight its potential roles in gene expression and chromatin dynamics, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its interaction network.
