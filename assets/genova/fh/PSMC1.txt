# PSMC1

## Overview
PSMC1 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 1, a crucial component of the 26S proteasome complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein functions as an ATPase, playing a vital role in the energy-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, which is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle and stress responses (Ebstein2023PSMC3). The 26S proteasome, comprising a 20S core and a 19S regulatory particle, relies on PSMC1 for the recognition and processing of ubiquitin-tagged substrates, facilitating their entry into the proteolytic core (Tian2022Methylation). PSMC1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, underscoring its involvement in diverse cellular functions such as transcription regulation and immune response (Larsson2022Pancancer). Additionally, PSMC1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Integrated; Jia2023Pancancer).

## Function
PSMC1 encodes a subunit of the 26S proteasome, a critical complex in eukaryotic cells responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. This degradation process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and responding to cellular stress. PSMC1 functions as an ATPase, providing the necessary energy for the unfolding and translocation of substrate proteins into the proteasome's 20S core, where proteolysis occurs (Ebstein2023PSMC3). 

The 26S proteasome consists of a 20S core particle and a 19S regulatory particle, with PSMC1 being part of the base of the 19S regulatory complex. This complex is crucial for recognizing and capturing ubiquitin-modified substrates, facilitating their entry into the proteolytic core (Tian2022Methylation). PSMC1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, reflecting its involvement in diverse cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins (Larsson2022Pancancer).

In healthy human cells, PSMC1 plays a significant role in adaptive immunity and antigen processing, highlighting its importance in immune system function (Tian2022Methylation). Its activity is vital for cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and apoptosis (Ullah2022Evaluating).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMC1 gene have been associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Li2021Integrated). In LUAD, PSMC1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues and is linked to worse survival outcomes. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor mutational burden, immune checkpoint expression, and specific immune cell profiles, such as the exclusion of B cells and enrichment of M1 macrophages (Jia2023Pancancer). The PSMC1 gene is part of a prognostic signature used to stratify LUAD patients into high- or low-risk groups, with high-risk groups showing higher PSMC1 expression and poorer survival (Jia2023Pancancer).

The PSMC1 gene is also implicated in cancer cell proliferation and invasion, with its expression associated with pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK, which are crucial for tumor development and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Jia2023Pancancer). These findings suggest that PSMC1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target. The gene's expression levels are more critical for prognosis than its methylation or genomic alterations (Jia2023Pancancer).

## Interactions
The PSMC1 gene encodes the 26S protease regulatory subunit 4, also known as P26s4, which is a component of the 26S proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. P26s4 interacts with TOPORS, a dual E3 ubiquitin and SUMO1 ligase, in the context of retinal dystrophies. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent co-localization studies in mammalian cell lines and retinal sections (Czub2016TOPORS). P26s4 and TOPORS co-localize at the interface between the photoreceptor outer segment and the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting a role in photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (Czub2016TOPORS).

The interaction between P26s4 and TOPORS is mediated by specific domains of TOPORS involved in SUMOylation, which may regulate P26s4's degradation processes. P26s4 contains SUMO-interacting motifs, indicating potential regulation by SUMOylation (Czub2016TOPORS). The C-terminal region of TOPORS, associated with its E3 SUMO1 ligase activity, interacts with P26s4, suggesting that P26s4 may be a SUMOylation substrate for TOPORS (Czub2016TOPORS). This interaction is significant for understanding the phenotype associated with RP31 mutations, as photoreceptors are sensitive to disruptions in proteostasis (Czub2016TOPORS).
