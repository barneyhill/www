# AQP5

## Overview
Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is a gene that encodes the aquaporin 5 protein, a member of the aquaporin family of transmembrane water channel proteins. These proteins are integral to the regulation of water transport across cell membranes, particularly in epithelial cells of exocrine glands such as salivary, lacrimal, and sweat glands (Direito2016Aquaporin5:; Agre2006The). The aquaporin 5 protein is characterized by its tetrameric structure, with each monomer forming a water pore that facilitates rapid water movement in response to osmotic gradients. This function is crucial for maintaining water homeostasis and is involved in physiological processes such as saliva secretion, tear production, and respiratory tract fluid regulation (Direito2016Aquaporin5:). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation, as well as interactions with other proteins that influence its localization and function (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5; Login2021Aquaporin5). Alterations in AQP5 expression have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Jaskiewicz2023The; Ala2021Aquaporins).

## Structure
Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) is a water channel protein that forms a tetrameric structure in the cell membrane, with each monomer acting as an independent water channel. Each monomer consists of 265 amino acids and is composed of six transmembrane alpha-helices connected by five loops, with both the N-terminus and C-terminus located in the cytoplasm (Wang2021Deciphering; Direito2016Aquaporin5:). The loops B and E fold back into the membrane, forming two half-helices with conserved asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) motifs, which are critical for water and solute permeation (Direito2016Aquaporin5:). 

The AQP5 pore contains two conserved filters: the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) constriction selectivity filter and the NPA-capped ends of the half-helices. These filters prevent the permeation of large molecules and positive charges, including protons, thus maintaining proton gradients (Direito2016Aquaporin5:). The ar/R filter is composed of an arginine residue in an aromatic environment, excluding solutes larger than 2.8 Å (Direito2016Aquaporin5:). 

AQP5's structure was solved with a lipid molecule occluding the central pore, whose physiological relevance is unclear but may inhibit oxygen permeation (Direito2016Aquaporin5:). The protein is dynamically regulated through transcriptional and translational modulation, post-translational modifications, and trafficking to the plasma membrane (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5).

## Function
Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) is a water channel protein that plays a crucial role in facilitating water transport across cell membranes, primarily in epithelial cells of exocrine glands such as salivary, lacrimal, and sweat glands. In healthy human cells, AQP5 is involved in maintaining water homeostasis by enabling rapid water movement in response to osmotic gradients, which is essential for processes like saliva secretion, tear production, and respiratory tract fluid regulation (Direito2016Aquaporin5:; Agre2006The).

Structurally, AQP5 is a tetramer composed of four identical monomers, each forming a water pore. These monomers contain conserved asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) motifs critical for water and solute permeation. The protein's pore structure includes selective filters that prevent the passage of large molecules and protons, ensuring efficient water transport while maintaining cellular ion balance (Direito2016Aquaporin5:).

AQP5 is primarily located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells, where it facilitates water transport. Its regulation involves complex mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, as well as gating mechanisms that allow AQP5 to switch between open and closed states, affecting water permeability (Direito2016Aquaporin5:). This function is vital for maintaining water balance in tissues and contributes to processes like airway hydration and skin moisture regulation (Direito2016Aquaporin5:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AQP5 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, AQP5 overexpression is associated with the progression of various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, where it is involved in tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5; Jaskiewicz2023The). AQP5 is also implicated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where its high expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes (Chen2022AQP5).

In non-cancerous conditions, mutations in AQP5, such as p.Leu51Pro, are linked to congenital cataracts, affecting lens transparency and leading to blindness in infants (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5). AQP5 expression is altered in Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands, where decreased AQP5 expression contributes to reduced saliva and tear production (Ala2021Aquaporins). The gene's expression is also influenced by hormonal and inflammatory stimuli, impacting conditions like endometriosis and pulmonary diseases (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5).

AQP5's role in signaling pathways, such as the Ras-MAPK and EGFR pathways, further underscores its involvement in cancer cell proliferation and migration, making it a potential therapeutic target (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5; Elkhider2020Aquaporin).

## Interactions
Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function and localization. AQP5 interacts with Aquaporin 2 (AQP2), impairing AQP2's cell surface expression and reducing its abundance on the plasma membrane. This interaction is significant in the context of kidney function and water homeostasis (Wu2013Aqp5).

AQP5 also interacts with several cell adhesion proteins, including β-catenin, plakoglobin, and desmoglein 2 (DSG2). These interactions are crucial for regulating junctional protein levels and cell-cell adhesion. AQP5 overexpression can lead to decreased levels of these proteins at cell-cell contacts, which may facilitate cancer cell dissemination (Login2021Aquaporin5).

In secretory cells, AQP5 interacts with proteins such as the Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), anion exchanger 2 (AE2), TRPV4, and prolactin-inducible protein (PIP). These interactions are important for AQP5's trafficking and function, particularly in regulating cell volume and maintaining proper localization in tissues like the lacrimal glands (D’Agostino2023Aquaporin5; TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).

The interaction between AQP5 and ezrin, involving the ezrin FERM domain and AQP5's C-terminus, is essential for AQP5's localization and trafficking, particularly in the context of diseases like Sjögren's syndrome (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight).
