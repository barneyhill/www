# RPS6KA1

## Overview
RPS6KA1 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This kinase is characterized by its dual kinase domains, which enable it to function as a downstream effector in various cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and cell cycle progression (Lee2007p90; Wright2023Therapeutic). The protein encoded by RPS6KA1 is activated through a series of phosphorylation events, which are crucial for its role in mediating cellular responses to external stimuli (Cargnello2011Activation). RPS6KA1 is implicated in cell growth, proliferation, and survival, and its dysregulation is associated with pathological conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it contributes to drug resistance and poor prognosis (Weidenauer2023The; Guo2024RPS6KA1). As a result, RPS6KA1 is considered a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment strategies.

## Structure
The RPS6KA1 gene encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes two non-identical kinase domains: an N-terminal kinase domain (NTKD) and a C-terminal kinase domain (CTKD) (Lee2007p90; Wright2023Therapeutic). The NTKD is responsible for substrate phosphorylation, while the CTKD is crucial for the activation of the NTKD by mediating signals from MAPKs (Lee2007p90; Wright2023Therapeutic).

Activation of RPS6KA1 involves phosphorylation at specific sites, including Ser573 in the CTKD and Ser363 in the linker region, followed by autophosphorylation at Ser380, which creates a docking site for PDK1 (Lee2007p90). This phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification essential for the protein's function. The protein's structure allows it to act as a downstream effector in the MAPK/ERK pathway, playing roles in various cellular processes such as transcription, translation, and cell cycle progression (Wright2023Therapeutic; Weidenauer2023The).

RPS6KA1 may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties and interactions.

## Function
RPS6KA1 encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This kinase plays a crucial role in cell growth, proliferation, and survival by phosphorylating various substrates, including ribosomal protein S6. RPS6KA1 is activated in response to Ras/MAPK pathway signals, leading to the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 at Ser235 and Ser236. This phosphorylation event facilitates the assembly of the translation preinitiation complex, enhancing cap-dependent translation and linking the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway to translation initiation regulation (Cargnello2011Activation).

RPS6KA1 is also involved in cell survival mechanisms. It phosphorylates the proapoptotic protein Bad, enhancing its binding to 14-3-3 proteins, and inactivates death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), which increases cell survival. It promotes survival through transcription-dependent mechanisms by phosphorylating the transcription factor CREB, thereby increasing the transcription of survival-promoting genes (Cargnello2011Activation).

In addition to its role in translation and survival, RPS6KA1 is involved in regulating intracellular pH, cell volume, and neurite outgrowth by phosphorylating substrates such as the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE-1) and the cell adhesion molecule L1 (Cargnello2011Activation).

## Clinical Significance
The RPS6KA1 gene is clinically significant in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression levels of RPS6KA1 are associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates in AML patients. This gene is identified as a key prognostic risk factor, with its elevated expression linked to increased AML-related gene mutations and chemotherapy resistance (Yu2021Dysregulation; Guo2024RPS6KA1). RPS6KA1 is involved in the regulation of histone deacetylation and is enriched in pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway, which are crucial in cancer progression (Guo2024RPS6KA1).

Inhibition of RPS6KA1 has been shown to reduce proliferation, migration, and invasion of AML cells, while inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting malignant progression (Guo2024RPS6KA1). The gene also plays a role in drug resistance, particularly in resistance to venetoclax and azacitidine, where its inhibition can increase the efficacy of these treatments (Weidenauer2023The). RPS6KA1's interaction with other proteins, such as MCL-1, further underscores its role in AML treatment resistance (Weidenauer2023The). These findings highlight RPS6KA1 as a potential therapeutic target in AML.

## Interactions
RPS6KA1, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is a downstream effector in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, where it interacts with ERK1/2, which phosphorylates and activates RPS6KA1 (Guo2024RPS6KA1). This activation allows RPS6KA1 to phosphorylate several substrates, including transcription factors such as CREB and c-Fos, which are crucial for gene expression regulation.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RPS6KA1 interacts with glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), where its inhibition leads to increased GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of MCL-1 at serine 159, resulting in MCL-1 degradation. This interaction is significant because MCL-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax, a drug used in AML treatment (Weidenauer2023The). RPS6KA1 also affects apoptosis by modifying pro-apoptotic factors such as BAD and BIM, contributing to cell survival and drug resistance (Weidenauer2023The).

RPS6KA1 is also implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through its interaction with ETS1 in the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction is modulated by AMPKα2, which, when knocked down, results in the downregulation of RPS6KA1 and ETS1, thereby impairing EMT progression (Yin2020Knockdown).
