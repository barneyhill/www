# RER1

## Overview
RER1 is a gene that encodes the protein retention in endoplasmic reticulum sorting receptor 1, a transmembrane sorting receptor involved in the quality control and assembly of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is characterized by four transmembrane domains and plays a crucial role in retrieving unassembled subunits of oligomeric membrane complexes, such as the γ-secretase complex, from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. This retrieval process is essential for proper protein assembly and preventing the secretion of misfolded proteins, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Annaert2020Bring). RER1's function is significant in various physiological processes, including neuromuscular junction function and neuronal activity, by ensuring the correct assembly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels (Annaert2020Bring). Additionally, alterations in RER1 expression have been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2019RER1; Annaert2020Bring; Park2017The).

## Structure
The RER1 protein is a 23 kDa sorting receptor characterized by four transmembrane domains (TMDs) and cytosolic N- and C-termini (JurischYaksi2013Protein; Annaert2020Bring). These TMDs are crucial for its function in recognizing and binding to specific motifs within its cargo proteins, facilitating their retrieval to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Annaert2020Bring). The protein's structure includes spaced polar residues within the hydrophobic core of its TMDs, which are essential for interaction with various cargo proteins (Annaert2020Bring).

RER1 contains several highly conserved domains, including a cytoplasmic loop between TMD2 and TMD3, a small lumenal loop between TMD3 and TMD4, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Annaert2020Bring). These domains are highly conserved across species, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Annaert2020Bring).

Post-translational modifications of RER1 include ubiquitination, which is mediated by the NEDD4-2 protein. This modification targets RER1 for degradation via the proteasomal pathway, particularly under conditions of ER stress (Liu2022Nedd42). The interaction between NEDD4-2 and RER1 is facilitated by a STPY motif in the N-terminal domain of RER1 (Liu2022Nedd42).

## Function
The RER1 gene encodes a sorting receptor protein that plays a critical role in the quality control and assembly of various proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. It is involved in the retrieval of unassembled subunits of oligomeric membrane complexes, such as the γ-secretase complex, from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER, ensuring proper protein assembly and preventing the secretion of misfolded proteins (Annaert2020Bring). RER1 is essential for the assembly of the γ-secretase complex, which processes over 90 substrates, including the amyloid-β precursor protein, and is crucial for controlling amyloid-β production, implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Annaert2020Bring).

RER1 also interacts with unassembled subunits of the skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), preventing their escape from the ER and ensuring proper assembly, which is vital for neuromuscular junction function (Annaert2020Bring). Additionally, RER1 is involved in the assembly of voltage-gated sodium channels in the central nervous system, affecting neuronal function (Annaert2020Bring). The protein is active in the ER and Golgi compartments, maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring proteins are correctly processed and transported (Annaert2020Bring).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RER1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In pancreatic cancer, RER1 is upregulated, and its higher expression is associated with poor survival outcomes. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. RER1 also enhances the stem-cell-like behavior of cancer cells, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Chen2019RER1).

RER1 is involved in the degradation of α-synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Overexpression of RER1 decreases α-synuclein levels, suggesting that RER1 could be a therapeutic target for reducing α-synuclein accumulation and associated cytotoxicity (Park2017The).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RER1 affects the assembly of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in amyloid-β peptide production. Alterations in RER1 expression can influence amyloid-β levels, potentially impacting disease progression (Annaert2020Bring).

RER1 is also linked to 1p36-deletion syndrome, a condition characterized by brain disorders and developmental abnormalities. The gene's location within the deleted region suggests that its reduced expression may contribute to the syndrome's symptoms (Hara2018Rer1mediated).

## Interactions
RER1 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and protein assembly processes. It interacts with unassembled subunits of oligomeric membrane complexes, such as the skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and voltage-gated Na+ channels, preventing their escape from the ER and subsequent degradation (Annaert2020Bring). RER1 also binds to components of the γ-secretase complex, specifically nicastrin (NCT) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), acting as a negative regulator of γ-secretase assembly (Annaert2020Bring).

In yeast, RER1 interacts with the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Sec12p, a protein involved in ER localization, and is dynamically localized to the Golgi apparatus by coatomer (Sato2001Rer1p). It also interacts with peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), particularly mutant forms associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, playing a role in their retention within the ER (Hara2014Rer1). Additionally, RER1 interacts with DAP12, a transmembrane adapter protein, retaining it in the ER before assembly with TREM2, which is crucial for immune cell function (Liu2024DAP12). These interactions highlight RER1's role in the assembly, localization, and quality control of various proteins.
