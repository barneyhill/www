# CCDC146

## Overview
CCDC146 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 146 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the organization and function of centrioles and microtubules. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a PF05557 motif associated with mitotic checkpoint proteins (Muroňová2023Lack). CCDC146 is primarily localized to the centrosome and microtubular structures, playing a crucial role in cell division and spermatogenesis by contributing to the assembly of the mitotic spindle and the formation of the sperm flagellum (Muroňová2023Lack). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as CFAP58, underscore its role in maintaining ciliary function and structural integrity (McCafferty2023An). Clinically, mutations in CCDC146 are linked to non-syndromic male infertility and have implications in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), highlighting its significance in both reproductive health and neurological conditions (Muroňová2023Lack; Zhang2024Deep).

## Structure
The CCDC146 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Muroňová2023Lack). These domains typically form alpha-helical structures, although the specific function of these domains in CCDC146 is not fully understood (Muroňová2023Lack). The protein also contains a PF05557 motif, which is associated with mitotic checkpoint proteins (Muroňová2023Lack).

CCDC146 is known to form part of a stable complex with CFAP58, involving coiled-coil interactions in a head-to-head conformation, suggesting a quaternary structure that supports its role in cilia function (McCafferty2023An). The protein is associated with microtubule doublets in spermatozoa, indicating its role as an axonemal protein (Muroňová2023Lack).

Post-translational modifications of CCDC146 may include phosphorylation, as suggested by the slightly higher molecular weight observed in tagged versions of the protein, indicating possible modifications (Muroňová2023Lack). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CCDC146 are not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The CCDC146 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of centrioles and microtubules in human cells. It is primarily associated with the centrosome, the major microtubule-organizing center in animal cells, and is involved in various cell cycle-dependent processes. In somatic cells, CCDC146 localizes to the centrosome and other microtubular structures, such as the mitotic spindle, and is involved in cell division by controlling the assembly of the mitotic spindle (Muroňová2023Lack).

CCDC146 is also crucial for spermatogenesis, particularly during the spermiogenesis stage, where it is involved in the formation of the sperm flagellum and the head-to-tail coupling apparatus. It localizes to the axoneme of the sperm flagellum, where it is associated with microtubule doublets, essential for sperm motility (Muroňová2023Lack). The absence of CCDC146 leads to non-syndromic male infertility due to immotile and non-functional sperm, highlighting its essential role in spermatogenesis (Muroňová2023Lack). The protein's ability to localize to multiple subcellular compartments suggests it contains several domains, including a PF05557 motif related to the mitotic spindle checkpoint (Muroňová2023Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC146 gene are associated with non-syndromic male infertility, specifically linked to Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Flagella (MMAF) syndrome. This condition is characterized by severe asthenozoospermia, where total sperm motility is below 10%, and various flagellar abnormalities. Pathogenic bi-allelic mutations in CCDC146 have been identified in infertile patients, leading to defects in sperm axoneme formation and function, resulting in immotile and non-functional sperm (Muroňová2023Lack).

In addition to its role in male infertility, alterations in CCDC146 expression have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A specific noncoding genetic variant linked to elevated CCDC146 expression exacerbates ALS-associated phenotypes, such as TDP-43 mislocalization in motor neurons. Suppression of CCDC146 using an antisense oligonucleotide has been shown to rescue ALS-associated survival defects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ALS (Zhang2024Deep).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC146 in both reproductive health and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the importance of understanding its genetic and molecular interactions.

## Interactions
CCDC146 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion membrane protein CT288. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. CCDC146 is recruited to the periphery of the Chlamydia-containing vacuole in infected cells, suggesting a specific interaction with CT288, although this recruitment does not solely depend on CT288 (Almeida2018The). The interaction is particularly associated with the C-terminal region of CCDC146, spanning residues 692-955, which binds to CT288 (Almeida2018The).

CCDC146 also interacts with proteins involved in the structure and function of motile cilia. It forms a complex with CFAP58, potentially contributing to the structural integrity of axonemal dyneins. This interaction is part of a broader network involving other ciliopathy-related proteins, such as CCDC39 and CCDC40, which are crucial for the structural organization of cilia (McCafferty2023An). These interactions highlight the role of CCDC146 in both infection-related processes and the maintenance of ciliary function.
