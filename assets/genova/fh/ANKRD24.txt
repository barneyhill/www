# ANKRD24

## Overview
ANKRD24 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 24 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, making the protein a potential player in various cellular processes. The ankyrin repeat domain 24 protein is implicated in the structural integrity and function of stereocilia, the hair-like projections in auditory hair cells, by being a candidate member of the ankle link complex. This complex is essential for the proper development and function of stereocilia, which are crucial for hearing (Yazdidoust2016Defining). Although the protein does not directly bind to MYO7A, a motor protein, it is found in MYO7A complexes, suggesting its involvement in the organization of stereocilia through indirect interactions (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A). The precise role of ANKRD24 in human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but it is hypothesized to contribute to cellular structure and function, potentially affecting cell signaling pathways (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A).

## Structure


## Function
ANKRD24 (ankyrin repeat domain 24) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. In the context of stereocilia in hair cells, ANKRD24 is implicated as a candidate member of the ankle link complex, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of these cellular projections. Stereocilia are essential for hearing, and the proper formation of ankle links is necessary for their development and function (Yazdidoust2016Defining).

ANKRD24 has been found to co-precipitate with MYO7A, a motor protein involved in the transport and localization of proteins within stereocilia. Although ANKRD24 does not directly bind to MYO7A, its presence in MYO7A complexes suggests it may interact through other proteins, indicating a role in the structural or functional organization of stereocilia (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A).

Despite its involvement in these complexes, the specific function of ANKRD24 in healthy human cells remains unclear. It is suggested to be involved in maintaining cellular structure and function, potentially influencing cell signaling pathways and interactions within the cytoplasm (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A).
