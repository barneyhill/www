# TAC3

## Overview
The TAC3 gene encodes the protein tachykinin precursor 3, which is a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides. This precursor is primarily responsible for producing neurokinin B (NKB), a peptide that plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. NKB is crucial for the modulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, thereby influencing reproductive function and development (Topaloglu2011Neurokinin; Silveira2010Impact). The TAC3 gene is organized into multiple exons, with specific regions encoding the NKB sequence, and it can produce different isoforms through alternative splicing (Page2005New). Mutations in TAC3 have been linked to reproductive disorders such as normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Francou2011Normosmic). Beyond its reproductive roles, TAC3 is also implicated in broader neuroendocrine functions, including the modulation of stress-related responses (Andero2014A).

## Structure
The TAC3 gene encodes the neurokinin B (NKB) peptide, which is part of the tachykinin family. The gene is organized into seven exons, with exon 5 specifically encoding the NKB sequence (Page2005New). In humans, TAC3 produces two precursor isoforms, β and γ TAC3, which differ in their last 24 C-terminal amino acid residues (Page2005New). The primary structure of NKB includes a conserved hydrophobic C-terminal region, FXGLM-NH2, crucial for receptor activation (Page2005New).

The secondary structure of NKB is predicted to include an α-helix, similar to the structure observed in related peptides (Campo2018Tachykinin3). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the peptide, which is important for its interaction with tachykinin receptors. There is no information on the quaternary structure of TAC3, as it typically functions as a single peptide rather than a multi-subunit complex.

Splice variants of TAC3 have been identified, including a variant missing exon 5, which encodes NKB, suggesting a mechanism for post-transcriptional control of peptide translation (Page2005New). The functional significance of these splice variants remains unclear.

## Function
The TAC3 gene encodes neurokinin B (NKB), a neuropeptide that is part of the tachykinin family and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which is essential for reproductive function. NKB is primarily active in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, where it influences the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (Topaloglu2011Neurokinin; Silveira2010Impact). This regulation is critical for the initiation and maintenance of the GnRH pulse generator, a key component in the control of reproductive hormone release (Topaloglu2011Neurokinin).

In healthy human cells, the TAC3 gene is essential for normal reproductive development and function. It influences the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, which is crucial for the control of human reproduction (Silveira2010Impact). The NKB/NK3R signaling pathway, involving the neurokinin 3 receptor encoded by TACR3, is vital for the proper functioning of the reproductive axis, affecting processes such as puberty onset and fertility (Topaloglu2011Neurokinin). Mutations in TAC3 can lead to conditions like normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, characterized by a failure of pubertal progression and low levels of sex steroids and gonadotropins (Silveira2010Impact).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TAC3 gene, which encodes the neuropeptide neurokinin B, are implicated in several reproductive disorders. Notably, TAC3 mutations are associated with normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH), a condition characterized by absent or incomplete puberty and low levels of sex steroids despite normal pituitary function (Francou2011Normosmic). This condition is linked to a low frequency of endogenous GnRH secretion, leading to an elevated FSH/LH ratio, which can serve as a diagnostic marker for prescreening patients (Francou2011Normosmic). The transmission of this genetic form is autosomal recessive (Francou2011Normosmic).

TAC3 mutations also play a role in idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which presents with similar reproductive challenges, including primary amenorrhea and micropenis (Silveira2010Impact). These mutations disrupt the normal signaling pathways necessary for the activation of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, crucial for reproductive function (Silveira2010Impact).

Alterations in TAC3 expression have been linked to neurological conditions, such as the modulation of fear memory consolidation, potentially contributing to stress-related disorders like PTSD (Andero2014A). This suggests that TAC3's role extends beyond reproductive health, impacting broader neuroendocrine functions.
