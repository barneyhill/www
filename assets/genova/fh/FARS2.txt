# FARS2

## Overview
FARS2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (mtPheRS), an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs, a fundamental step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Li2021Developmental; Chen2022Neuropathyassociated). The proper function of mtPheRS is essential for the assembly and operation of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is vital for ATP production and cellular respiration (Fan2021FARS2). Mutations in the FARS2 gene can lead to a variety of mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Almannai2018FARS2).

## Structure
FARS2 encodes the mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, a protein essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The primary structure of FARS2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and folding. The tertiary structure of FARS2 forms a three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to effectively catalyze the attachment of phenylalanine to its corresponding tRNA.

FARS2 may also participate in quaternary structure interactions if it forms complexes with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not provided. The protein contains specific domains, including a catalytic domain that is vital for its function in protein synthesis. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the protein's activity or interactions. Additionally, FARS2 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, which may result in variations in its functional or regulatory properties. These structural features and modifications are essential for the proper functioning of FARS2 in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

## Function
The FARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtPheRS), an enzyme essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of phenylalanine to its corresponding mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA Phe), a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Li2021Developmental; Chen2022Neuropathyassociated). These proteins are integral components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which is crucial for ATP production and cellular respiration (Li2021Developmental; Chen2022Neuropathyassociated).

In healthy human cells, FARS2 ensures the proper assembly and function of OXPHOS complexes, particularly complexes I, III, IV, and V, which are vital for energy production (Fan2021FARS2). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, including ATP generation, by supporting the stability and activity of these complexes (Chen2022Neuropathyassociated). FARS2 is widely expressed in multiple organs, including the heart, liver, kidney, and central nervous system, and its expression increases significantly in the brain during late embryonic development (Chen2022Neuropathyassociated). This widespread expression underscores its critical role in cellular energy metabolism and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FARS2 gene, which encodes mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders. These include infantile-onset epileptic mitochondrial encephalopathy, later-onset spastic paraplegia, and juvenile-onset refractory epilepsy. The mutations often lead to disrupted aminoacylation activity, resulting in a loss-of-function mechanism that impairs mitochondrial function and increases neuronal apoptosis (Chen2022Neuropathyassociated). 

FARS2 mutations are also linked to fatal infantile Alpers encephalopathy, characterized by treatment-resistant epilepsy, lactic acidosis, and developmental arrest. Neuroimaging in affected individuals often shows severe progressive cerebral atrophy, similar to Alpers syndrome, which is typically associated with mutations in other mitochondrial genes (Elo2012Mitochondrial). 

Additionally, FARS2 mutations can cause combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 14 (COXPD14), which presents with early-onset encephalopathy, developmental delay, and elevated lactate levels. The clinical presentation of FARS2-related disorders can vary significantly, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms and early death, while others may survive into adulthood (Li2022Two). 

The variability in clinical phenotypes suggests that FARS2 mutations may have secondary effects or tissue-specific impacts, complicating genotype-phenotype correlations (Almannai2018FARS2).

## Interactions
The FARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtPheRS), which primarily interacts with mitochondrial tRNA to facilitate the attachment of phenylalanine, a crucial step in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Almannai2018FARS2). The interaction between mtPheRS and tRNA involves specific domains of the enzyme, such as the anticodon binding domain (ABD), which is essential for recognizing and binding the tRNA anticodon loop (Peretz2020Breaking). This interaction is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, notably involving the guanine base at position 34 (G34) of the tRNA anticodon loop and specific amino acid residues in mtPheRS, such as Asp364 (Peretz2020Breaking).

Mutations in FARS2, such as Asp364Gly, can disrupt these interactions, leading to significant loss of aminoacylation activity and associated mitochondrial diseases (Peretz2020Breaking). The structural integrity and dynamic behavior of the mtPheRS-tRNA complex are crucial for its function, with molecular dynamics simulations highlighting the importance of maintaining an open conformation for effective tRNA binding and aminoacylation (Peretz2020Breaking). These interactions underscore the critical role of FARS2 in maintaining mitochondrial function and protein synthesis.
