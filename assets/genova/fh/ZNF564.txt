# ZNF564

## Overview
ZNF564 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 564, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF564, are typically involved in various cellular processes such as gene expression, cell differentiation, and development. The protein encoded by ZNF564 is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with various diseases, including diabetic kidney disease and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, ZNF564 has been identified as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis, particularly in gastric cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Zhou2021Prognostic; Peng2024Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF564 has been identified as a significant biomarker in the context of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and cognitive dysfunction. Studies using machine learning algorithms have highlighted ZNF564 as one of eight overlapping biomarkers with excellent predictive ability, as indicated by AUC values greater than 0.7. The gene's expression levels are associated with pathways involved in diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Specifically, the low expression phenotype of ZNF564 is linked to pathways like glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis heparan sulfate and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, which may contribute to the occurrence of these diseases (Peng2024Identification).

In the context of cancer, ZNF564 has been included in a prognostic signature for gastric cancer. This signature, constructed using transcription factors, has been shown to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer patients, with high-risk groups exhibiting lower survival rates. Although the study does not specifically discuss diseases directly caused by ZNF564 mutations, its role as part of a prognostic signature suggests its involvement in cancer progression (Zhou2021Prognostic). However, the specific mechanisms by which ZNF564 influences these conditions remain to be fully elucidated.
