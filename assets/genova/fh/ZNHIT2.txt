# ZNHIT2

## Overview
ZNHIT2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger HIT-type containing 2 protein, which plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the assembly and regulation of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) within the spliceosome. The protein is characterized by a zinc finger HIT domain, which facilitates its interaction with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, part of the R2TP chaperone system, crucial for pre-mRNA splicing and chromatin remodeling (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike; Serna2021CryoEM). ZNHIT2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis. Additionally, alterations in ZNHIT2 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Kanwal2018Characterization; Du2023Estimating).

## Structure
The ZNHIT2 protein contains a zinc finger HIT (zf-HIT) domain, characterized by two anti-parallel beta sheets followed by two alpha helices packed against the second beta sheet. This domain includes a conserved CCCC-CCHC motif where histidine and cysteine residues coordinate two zinc ions in a cross-brace manner (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). The tertiary structure of the zf-HIT domain resembles treble clef domains such as B-box, RING, and PHD, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). 

The C-terminal domain of ZNHIT2 is crucial for its interaction with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, as it binds strongly even in ATPase-deficient mutants, indicating that ATP binding or hydrolysis is not necessary for the interaction (Serna2021CryoEM). The ZNHIT2 C-terminal domain provides important contacts with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, as supported by cryoEM and XL-MS data (Serna2021CryoEM). The flexibility and heterogeneity of the ZNHIT2 C-terminal domain pose challenges for achieving atomic-level resolution, but its structural organization and interaction with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 have been elucidated (Serna2021CryoEM). The HIT domain of ZNHIT2 is not required for interaction with RUVBL1-RUVBL2, contrary to previous assumptions (Serna2021CryoEM).

## Function
ZNHIT2 is a protein involved in the assembly and regulation of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a critical component of the spliceosome responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. It functions as a cofactor for the RUVBL1/2 ATPases within the R2TP chaperone system, facilitating the assembly of the U5 snRNP by interacting with specific proteins such as PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200 (Malinová2017Assembly; Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). ZNHIT2 is suggested to act as a bridging factor between the R2TP complex and U5-specific proteins, playing a crucial role in the biogenesis and stability of the U5 snRNP (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike).

The protein is characterized by a zinc finger HIT domain, which is essential for its interaction with RUVBL2, particularly in the presence of ADP, indicating its role in protein-protein interactions rather than nucleotide binding (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). ZNHIT2 also influences the ATPase activity of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, which is important for the assembly of large macromolecular complexes, including those involved in chromatin remodeling and pre-mRNA processing (Serna2021CryoEM). Through these interactions, ZNHIT2 contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNHIT2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In familial lung cancer (FLC) within the Chinese population, ZNHIT2 mutations were found at significantly higher frequencies in lung cancer tissues compared to healthy samples, suggesting a potential association with lung cancer. However, the clinical significance of these mutations remains unclear, as they may also be present in healthy individuals as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) not directly linked to cancer (Kanwal2018Characterization).

In thyroid cancer, ZNHIT2 is one of the cuprotosis-related genes (CRGs) with higher expression levels in cancerous tissues compared to normal thyroid tissues. This elevated expression is negatively correlated with disease-free survival, indicating that higher ZNHIT2 expression may be associated with better survival outcomes (Du2023Estimating).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ZNHIT2 is identified as a low survival marker when upregulated, suggesting that increased expression of this gene is associated with lower survival rates in these patients (Diviney2019An).

The interaction of ZNHIT2 with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex is crucial for the biogenesis of pre-mRNA splicing factor 8 (PRPF8). Disruptions in these interactions, potentially due to mutations, could affect cellular processes, although the direct clinical implications of such disruptions are not fully understood (Serna2021CryoEM).

## Interactions
ZNHIT2 is known to interact with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, which are AAA+ ATPases, as part of the R2TP/PFDL chaperone system. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a component involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The zinc finger HIT (zf-HIT) domain of ZNHIT2 mediates its binding to RUVBL2, with the interaction being enhanced in the presence of ADP and reduced with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). ZNHIT2 also forms a complex with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and RPAP3, which recruits HSP90, indicating its role in the R2TP chaperone system (Serna2021CryoEM).

Cryo-electron microscopy studies have shown that ZNHIT2 binding induces conformational changes in the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, particularly affecting the RUVBL2 subunits by disrupting their interaction with nucleotides. This interaction stimulates the ATPase activity of the complex (Serna2021CryoEM). The C-terminal domain of ZNHIT2 is sufficient for binding to the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, with the DII domains of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 being crucial for this interaction (Serna2021CryoEM). ZNHIT2 is also involved in the regulation of PRPF8 biogenesis, interacting with other proteins such as ECD and AAR2, which are part of the network required for U5 snRNP assembly (Serna2021CryoEM).
