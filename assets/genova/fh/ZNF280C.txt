# ZNF280C

## Overview
ZNF280C is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 280C, also known as ZPET, which is a crucial component in the cellular DNA damage response. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its characteristic structural motif that facilitates binding to DNA. ZNF280C plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), primarily through modulating DNA end-resection processes. It achieves this by regulating the recruitment of the Mre11 nuclease to DSB sites, thereby influencing the balance between different DNA repair pathways (Moquin2018Localized; Kamaliyan2024Zinc). The protein's activity is independent of other known DNA repair proteins, highlighting its unique function in the DNA damage response. Clinically, alterations in ZNF280C expression or function have been implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy and male infertility, underscoring its significance in both oncological and reproductive health contexts (Chen2020Wholeexome; Moquin2018Localized).

## Function
ZNF280C, also known as ZPET, is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA damage repair processes. It is particularly important in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), where it functions by slowing DNA end-resection. This is achieved by regulating the recruitment of the Mre11 nuclease to DSB sites, thereby modulating the balance between different DNA repair pathways (Moquin2018Localized; Kamaliyan2024Zinc). ZNF280C binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and localizes to DSBs and stalled replication forks, inhibiting the binding of MRE11 to ssDNA and delaying its recruitment to chromatin. This action restricts homologous recombination (HR) by controlling DNA end resection, which is crucial for accurate DNA repair (Moquin2018Localized).

In the cellular context, ZNF280C is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA and other proteins to modulate gene expression and DNA repair processes. Its activity is independent of other proteins like 53BP1 and HELB, highlighting its unique role in the DNA damage response (Moquin2018Localized). The loss of ZNF280C can lead to increased HR efficiency and resistance to DNA damage, indicating its role as a repressor of HR and its importance in maintaining genomic integrity (Moquin2018Localized).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF280C, also known as ZPET, plays a significant role in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. Alterations in ZNF280C expression or function can have clinical implications, particularly in cancer and infertility. In the context of cancer, ZNF280C is involved in DNA double-strand break repair by regulating the recruitment of the Mre11 nuclease, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Loss of ZNF280C function can lead to increased DNA end-resection and homologous recombination, potentially contributing to chemotherapy resistance (Moquin2018Localized; Kamaliyan2024Zinc). This resistance is particularly noted in cells deficient in BRCA1, where ZNF280C loss enhances resistance to PARP inhibitors, a class of drugs used in cancer therapy (Moquin2018Localized).

In the realm of infertility, ZNF280C has been identified as a potential candidate gene for non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in a cohort of Chinese patients. The gene is highly expressed in human testes, particularly in spermatogonia, suggesting its involvement in spermatogenesis. Mutations or dysregulation of ZNF280C may contribute to male infertility by affecting homologous recombination processes essential for spermatogenesis (Chen2020Wholeexome). These findings underscore the importance of ZNF280C in both cancer resistance mechanisms and reproductive health.

## Interactions
ZNF280C, also known as ZPET, is a zinc finger protein involved in DNA damage repair processes. It plays a critical role in regulating the recruitment of the Mre11 nuclease to DNA double-strand break sites, thereby influencing DNA end-resection. The loss of ZNF280C leads to increased end-resection and homologous recombination, which may contribute to chemotherapy resistance (Kamaliyan2024Zinc). ZNF280C interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and localizes to DNA double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks. It inhibits the binding of MRE11 to ssDNA and delays the recruitment of MRE11 and CtIP to chromatin, thus slowing DNA end resection (Moquin2018Localized).

ZNF280C is also identified as a potential hub in the 'yellow' module of protein complexes that bind to histone H3 modifications, particularly H3K9me3. This suggests its role as a novel HP1-dependent H3K9me3 reader protein, although it was not identified as an interactor by the STRING database or literature mining (Kunowska2015Identification). The protein may be regulated by ATM/ATR kinases and undergoes ubiquitination and deSUMOylation in response to DNA damage, indicating its role as a regulatory node in the DNA damage response (Moquin2018Localized).
