# OR5H6

## Overview
OR5H6 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily H member 6, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium, thereby contributing to the sense of smell in humans (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR5H6 is implicated in embryonic development, particularly in cell positioning and recognition during early human development (Parveen2021Circulating). Additionally, it has been associated with liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, indicating potential roles in tumorigenesis and suggesting that its functions may extend beyond olfaction (Liu2021Discovery).

## Function
OR5H6 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR5H6 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory perception in humans (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR5H6 has been implicated in other biological processes. During human embryogenesis, OR5H6 may facilitate appropriate cell positioning and cell recognition, which are essential processes during the first and early second trimesters. This suggests that OR5H6 is involved in pathways crucial for embryonic development, particularly in ensuring proper cell positioning, a critical aspect of early human development (Parveen2021Circulating).

Furthermore, OR5H6 has been identified as one of the differentially expressed genes associated with liver metastasis in colorectal cancer. Although its exact function in healthy human cells is not detailed, olfactory receptors like OR5H6 are implicated in tumorigenesis, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction (Liu2021Discovery).
