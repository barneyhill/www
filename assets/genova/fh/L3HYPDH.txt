# L3HYPDH

## Overview
L3HYPDH is a gene that encodes the enzyme trans-L-3-hydroxyproline dehydratase, which is involved in the catabolic pathway of hydroxyproline, an amino acid derivative predominantly found in collagen. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydratase and is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the conversion of trans-L-3-hydroxyproline to Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate. This reaction is a critical step in the recycling of amino acids and the turnover of collagen, contributing to the maintenance of cellular amino acid pools and supporting metabolic processes related to collagen degradation (Maheshwari2021Tandem). The activity of L3HYPDH is essential for maintaining amino acid balance in tissues with high collagen turnover, such as the liver and muscle, thereby playing a significant role in tissue repair and remodeling (Cai2023The).

## Function
L3HYPDH encodes the enzyme trans-L-3-hydroxyproline dehydratase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of hydroxyproline, an amino acid derivative primarily found in collagen. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of trans-L-3-hydroxyproline to Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate, a key step in the recycling of amino acids and collagen turnover. The activity of L3HYPDH is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the maintenance of cellular amino acid pools and supports metabolic processes related to collagen degradation (Maheshwari2021Tandem).

In healthy human cells, the function of L3HYPDH is integral to maintaining the balance of amino acids derived from collagen, which is essential for various physiological processes, including tissue repair and remodeling. By facilitating the breakdown of hydroxyproline, L3HYPDH aids in the efficient recycling of amino acids, which can be redirected into other biosynthetic pathways or energy production. This enzymatic activity is particularly important in tissues with high collagen turnover, such as the liver and muscle, where it supports cellular homeostasis and metabolic flexibility (Cai2023The).
