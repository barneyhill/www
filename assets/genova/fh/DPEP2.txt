# DPEP2

## Overview
DPEP2, or dipeptidase 2, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent metalloprotease enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of dipeptides, particularly leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4, which plays a crucial role in inflammatory response modulation (Yang2019Dpep2). The protein encoded by DPEP2 is primarily expressed in lung tissues, especially within macrophages, and is implicated in various biological processes, including chemokine signaling and immune response regulation (Zhang2023Integrated). As a member of the metalloprotease family, dipeptidase 2 requires zinc for its enzymatic activity and is involved in the metabolism of glutathione and leukotrienes (Yang2019Dpep2). DPEP2 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with clinical outcomes and response to chemotherapy (Wang2023Dipeptidase‑2). Additionally, DPEP2's role in immune regulation and its potential as a biomarker in various diseases underscore its clinical significance (Zhang2023Integrated).

## Function
Dipeptidase 2 (DPEP2) is a dipeptidyl peptidase that plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) to leukotriene E4 (LTE4), a process crucial for modulating inflammatory responses in the body (Zhang2023Integrated). In healthy human cells, DPEP2 is highly expressed in normal lung tissues, particularly in macrophages, where it is involved in several biological processes, including chemokine signaling pathways, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, and humoral immune responses (Zhang2023Integrated). The enzyme's activity is primarily extracellular, where it contributes to the metabolism of glutathione and leukotrienes, and is part of the metalloprotease family, requiring zinc for its enzymatic activity (Yang2019Dpep2).

DPEP2 also plays a role in immune regulation by modulating macrophage function. It has been implicated as an inflammatory regulator, potentially through the repression of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages (Yang2019Dpep2). This regulatory function suggests that DPEP2 may help maintain immune homeostasis and protect against excessive inflammation in healthy tissues (Zhang2023Integrated).

## Clinical Significance
DPEP2 (dipeptidase 2) has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. Alterations in DPEP2 expression are associated with various clinical outcomes in LUAD. Specifically, low expression of DPEP2 is linked to poor prognosis and advanced disease stages, while its overexpression is associated with improved sensitivity to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug used in LUAD treatment (Wang2023Dipeptidase‑2). DPEP2 overexpression inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduces the expression of cancer stem cell markers, which are critical in cancer metastasis and progression (Wang2023Dipeptidase‑2).

In addition to its role in cancer, DPEP2 is involved in modulating immune responses. It is associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, particularly affecting macrophages and dendritic cells. High DPEP2 expression correlates with a stronger response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting its potential as an immune-associated biomarker in LUAD (Zhang2023Integrated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DPEP2 in both cancer prognosis and immune regulation, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies in LUAD.

## Interactions
Dipeptidase 2 (DPEP2) is involved in various interactions within the immune microenvironment, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). DPEP2 is positively correlated with several genes, including FGR, AMICA1, PRAM1, CD37, and PARVG, with FGR being the most significant. FGR is known to negatively regulate macrophage phagocytosis, suggesting that DPEP2 may modulate macrophage function in LUAD (Zhang2023Integrated). DPEP2 is also associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages and mast cells, and interacts with immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive factors such as HAVCR2, CSF1R, IL10, CD86, CD48, and CD80 (Zhang2023Integrated).

In addition to its role in LUAD, DPEP2 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), where it was upregulated and showed potential as a biomarker (Wu2021Integrating). Although specific protein-protein interactions involving DPEP2 in PDR are not detailed, its involvement in immune pathways suggests it may participate in regulatory interactions affecting enzymatic activity and immune responses (Wu2021Integrating). These interactions highlight DPEP2's potential role in modulating immune responses and its significance as a biomarker in various diseases.
