# FAM131A

## Overview
FAM131A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 131 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes and has been categorized as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) due to its role in cancer pathogenesis. Alterations in the expression of FAM131A have been linked to several types of cancer, including ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma, where it is associated with poor patient survival rates (Wee2018Identification). Additionally, FAM131A has been identified as a potential biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis due to elevated autoantibody levels in patients (Wang2023Autoantibody). Despite its involvement in cancer, specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in FAM131A remain underexplored (Appay2020Multiplexed).

## Clinical Significance
FAM131A has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression and interactions contributing to disease pathogenesis. In a study focusing on cancer prognosis, FAM131A was identified as one of the genes with significant copy number gains and consistent up-regulation, particularly in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma. These alterations were associated with poor patient survival rates, highlighting the gene's potential role in cancer progression and its significance as a target for cancer therapies (Wee2018Identification).

In lung cancer, FAM131A was identified as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) with elevated autoantibody levels in patients. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis. The presence of autoantibodies against FAM131A was significantly higher in lung cancer patients compared to normal controls, indicating its involvement in the immune response to tumors (Wang2023Autoantibody).

While FAM131A has been associated with rare BRAF fusions in pilocytic astrocytomas, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in FAM131A have not been detailed in the available studies (Appay2020Multiplexed).
