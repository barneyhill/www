# LONRF2

## Overview
LONRF2 is a gene that encodes the protein LON peptidase N-terminal domain and ring finger 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a LON peptidase domain and a ring finger motif, suggesting its role in protein degradation and ubiquitination pathways. LONRF2 has been studied for its potential involvement in the regulation of protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses. Recent research has highlighted the significance of LONRF2 in the context of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, where alterations in its methylation status have been linked to disease progression (Iwaizumi2022Methylation). The gene's epigenetic modifications may serve as early markers for tumorigenesis, making it a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
LONRF2 (LON peptidase N-terminal domain and ring finger 2) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. Alterations in the methylation of the LONRF2 gene have been associated with colorectal cancer progression. A case study involving a patient with numerous laterally spreading tumors (LST-NG) and colorectal cancer revealed significant methylation of the CpG island promoters of LONRF2 in both LST-NG lesions and cancerous tissue. This methylation is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis, suggesting that epigenetic changes in LONRF2 may play a role in the early stages of colorectal cancer development (Iwaizumi2022Methylation).

The study also highlighted that while somatic mutations in genes like APC, TP53, and FBXW7 were present in cancer samples, the methylation of LONRF2 was consistent across both non-cancerous and cancerous lesions, indicating its potential role as an early epigenetic marker in colorectal cancer (Iwaizumi2022Methylation). These findings underscore the importance of LONRF2 methylation in the context of colorectal cancer and suggest that it may serve as a target for early detection and therapeutic intervention.
