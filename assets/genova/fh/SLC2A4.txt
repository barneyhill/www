# SLC2A4

## Overview
SLC2A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 4, commonly known as GLUT4, which is a transmembrane glucose transporter. GLUT4 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and striated muscle, including skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it plays a crucial role in insulin-regulated glucose uptake. This protein is integral to maintaining glucose homeostasis, as it facilitates the transport of glucose across cell membranes in response to insulin signaling. The proper functioning of GLUT4 is essential for energy storage and utilization, and its dysregulation is associated with metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Huang2007The; Klip2019Thirty). The SLC2A4 gene and its encoded protein are central to the study of insulin signaling pathways and metabolic health (Leto2012Regulation).

## Structure
The SLC2A4 gene encodes the GLUT4 protein, a glucose transporter primarily found in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The primary structure of GLUT4 consists of 509 amino acid residues, with leucine, glycine, alanine, and valine being the most abundant amino acids (Aruleba2018Structural). The secondary structure includes 22 α-helices, 6 β-strands, and 28 coils, confirming its role as a transmembrane protein (Aruleba2018Structural). 

GLUT4's tertiary structure is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature among sugar transporters, facilitating its function in glucose transport across cell membranes (Huang2007The). Unique sequences in the N-terminal and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains are crucial for its membrane trafficking capability, including a distinctive N-terminal sequence with a phenylalanine residue and dileucine and acidic motifs in the COOH terminus (Huang2007The). 

The quaternary structure of GLUT4 allows it to form homotetramers, which is significant for its function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate its activity and cellular localization (Huang2007The). These structural features place GLUT4 at the intersection of insulin signaling and membrane trafficking fields, highlighting its importance in glucose homeostasis.

## Function
The SLC2A4 gene encodes the GLUT4 protein, a critical glucose transporter involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis in healthy human cells. GLUT4 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue and striated muscle, including skeletal and cardiac muscles. It plays a vital role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, a process essential for regulating blood sugar levels after carbohydrate ingestion (Huang2007The; Klip2019Thirty).

In the absence of insulin, GLUT4 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles known as GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs). Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 translocates to the plasma membrane, facilitating glucose entry into cells. This translocation is mediated by the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, where AKT2 is a key player in GLUT4 trafficking (Huang2007The; Leto2012Regulation). The process involves the exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles, significantly increasing glucose transport activity (Holman1994Subcellular).

GLUT4's function is crucial for energy homeostasis, as it allows glucose to be stored as glycogen in muscle and as triglycerides in adipose tissue. The proper functioning of GLUT4 is essential for insulin sensitivity, and its dysregulation is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (Klip2019Thirty; Leto2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC2A4 gene, which encodes the GLUT4 glucose transporter, have significant clinical implications. Mutations in SLC2A4 can lead to impaired glucose metabolism, contributing to conditions such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. For instance, a point mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in the Slc2a4 gene has been associated with phenotypes similar to GLUT4 knockout mice, including impaired glucose clearance and elevated blood glucose levels (de2017Asleep). This mutation also results in behavioral changes and symptoms consistent with chronic fatigue, such as decreased activity and disrupted sleep patterns (de2017Asleep).

Alterations in GLUT4 expression levels can also impact glucose homeostasis. Reduced expression of GLUT4 in muscle and adipose tissue is linked to insulin resistance and a predisposition to diabetes, while overexpression enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (Huang2007The). Tissue-specific depletion of GLUT4 can lead to significant metabolic effects, such as decreased insulin responsiveness in other tissues (Huang2007The). These findings underscore the critical role of SLC2A4 in maintaining glucose homeostasis and its potential impact on metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
SLC2A4, also known as GLUT4, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in glucose transport. It interacts with proteins involved in insulin signaling pathways, such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which facilitate its translocation to the plasma membrane, a key step in glucose uptake (Sneha2018Probing). In prostate cancer cells, SLC2A4 is a central node in protein-protein interaction networks, connecting with various proteins including heat shock proteins (HSPA5, HSPA9, HSPD1, HSPB1), tubulin (TUBB2C), and vimentin (VIM), indicating its role in controlling information flow within these networks (CHEN2016Construction).

SLC2A4 is also regulated by transcription factors such as SP1 and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). The interaction between ESR1 and SP1 enhances the expression of SLC2A4 by increasing SP1 binding activity to the SLC2A4 gene promoter, suggesting a cooperative mechanism in its regulation (BarretoAndrade2018Estrogen). Additionally, SLC2A4's expression and function can be influenced by inflammatory and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, as demonstrated by the downregulation of SLC2A4 in response to palmitate treatment in muscle cells (EbersbachSilva2018Palmitateinduced). These interactions highlight the multifaceted regulatory mechanisms governing SLC2A4 activity and its importance in cellular glucose metabolism.
