# CDA

## Overview
Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytidine deaminase, which plays a pivotal role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a deaminase and is crucial for the metabolism of nucleotides, facilitating the conversion of cytidine and deoxycytidine into uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. The CDA gene is expressed primarily in the cytoplasm, although the enzyme can also be found in the nucleus due to a bipartite nuclear localization signal. The enzyme functions as a homotetramer, with each subunit containing an active site and a zinc atom essential for its catalytic activity. The structural integrity and function of cytidine deaminase are maintained by specific amino acid residues, which are conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary significance. Mutations in the CDA gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of chemotherapy, where they can affect drug metabolism and influence treatment outcomes (Ciccolini2010Cytidine; Vincenzetti2007Modulation; Frances2020The).

## Structure
Human cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a homotetrameric enzyme crucial for pyrimidine metabolism. Each subunit of CDA contains an active site and a zinc atom, essential for its catalytic activity (Vincenzetti2007Modulation). The enzyme's primary structure includes specific amino acid residues that are vital for its function and stability. Notably, residues such as tyrosine 33 (Y33) and phenylalanine 137 (F137) play significant roles in maintaining the enzyme's quaternary structure and active site arrangement. Mutations at these sites can lead to inactive forms of the enzyme, highlighting their importance in tetramer assembly (Vincenzetti2007Modulation).

The secondary structure of CDA involves alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Micozzi2010Role). The quaternary structure is stabilized by intersubunit interactions, with Y33 being particularly crucial for these interactions. Disruption of these interactions, such as through the Y33G mutation, results in a preference for a less stable homodimer form, significantly decreasing catalytic activity (Micozzi2010Role).

CDA also undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and stability. These structural features are essential for the enzyme's role in catalyzing the deamination of cytidine to uridine.

## Function
Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a crucial enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which is essential for maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis in healthy human cells. CDA catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and deoxycytidine into uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively, by hydrolyzing the amine moiety into a ketone with the release of ammonia. This process not only recycles pyrimidines for nucleotide synthesis but also degrades them to provide a constant source of carbon and nitrogen, contributing to the formation of β-alanine (Frances2020The).

CDA is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it recycles free pyrimidines, which are then transported into the nucleus or mitochondria for integration into DNA or RNA. It can also be present in the nucleus due to a bipartite nuclear localization signal (Frances2020The). The enzyme forms a homotetramer to function effectively, with each catalytic site formed by the interaction of three monomers. Its activity is regulated by specific amino acids that are conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Frances2020The).

CDA plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing replicative stress and ensuring proper DNA replication and repair. Its deficiency can lead to genetic instability, as seen in conditions like Bloom syndrome (Frances2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDA gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of chemotherapy. Variants in the CDA gene, such as 79A>C and 208G>A, have been associated with variations in enzyme activity, impacting the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents like cytarabine and gemcitabine. These variations can lead to altered drug efficacy and toxicity, influencing treatment outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers (Abraham2012Cytidine; Ciccolini2010Cytidine).

Increased expression of CDA is linked to resistance to cytarabine in AML patients, as it leads to the rapid inactivation of the drug, reducing its therapeutic effectiveness (Abraham2012Cytidine). Conversely, decreased CDA activity, often due to genetic polymorphisms, can result in severe toxicities during treatment with cytarabine and gemcitabine, as seen in patients with low CDA enzymatic activity (Ciccolini2012CDA; Ciccolini2010Cytidine).

The presence of specific CDA polymorphisms, such as the -31delC SNP, has been associated with increased gene expression, yet can paradoxically result in a poor metabolizer phenotype when combined with other variants, complicating the genotype-phenotype relationship (Ciccolini2012CDA). These findings underscore the importance of considering CDA genetic variants in personalizing chemotherapy regimens to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.

## Interactions
Human cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a homotetrameric enzyme that plays a crucial role in pyrimidine metabolism. The enzyme is active only when assembled as a tetramer, with each subunit containing an active site and a zinc atom. The monomeric form of CDA is inactive, highlighting the importance of intersubunit interactions for its enzymatic activity (Vincenzetti2007Modulation). Specific amino acids, such as Y33 and Y60, are critical for these intersubunit interactions and contribute to the active site formation. Mutations at these residues can disrupt the tetrameric structure, leading to inactive monomers (Vincenzetti2007Modulation).

The study of various mutations, including Y60G, F137A, and R68Q/R68G, has shown that these residues are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of CDA. For instance, the Y60G mutation results in a more compact enzyme structure, while the F137A mutation leads to an inactive enzyme unable to form a tetramer (Vincenzetti2007Modulation). These findings underscore the significance of specific amino acids in the stability and function of CDA, as well as their role in facilitating the enzyme's interactions within its tetrameric assembly (Vincenzetti2007Modulation).
