# CHCHD7

## Overview
CHCHD7, or coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 7, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. The protein, characterized by its coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, is a member of the twin CX9C protein family and is crucial for its structural stability and function within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (Banci2012Structural). The CHCHD7 protein is homologous to the yeast protein Cox23, suggesting a potential role in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly, although its exact function in humans remains to be fully elucidated (Gladyck2021Regulation; Banci2012Structural). The gene is located on chromosome 8q12 and is implicated in the development of pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland through gene fusions, notably with the PLAG1 oncogene (Stenman2022Chromosome). Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular activities of CHCHD7 and its contributions to cellular homeostasis and disease.

## Structure
The CHCHD7 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which is stabilized by disulfide bonds. The protein has a molecular weight of 10.2 kDa and consists of 85 amino acids, with the CHCH domain located in the N-terminal region and a C-terminal extension of 38 residues (Banci2012Structural). The secondary structure of CHCHD7 includes two alpha-helices typical of the CHCH domain and an additional alpha-helix in the C-terminal region. These three alpha-helices form a prolate, ellipsoidal-shaped molecule, with the third helix perpendicular to the polar axis (Banci2012Structural).

The first alpha-helix (a1) is formed by residues 17-29, while the second helix (a2) is unusually long, comprising residues 38-59. The extended part of helix a2 interacts with the C-terminal helix a3. Hydrophobic interhelical interactions involve residues Leu17, Ala22, Leu27 in helix a1, and Tyr44, Tyr40, Phe41 in helix a2, although they do not form a compact patch, indicating the importance of disulfide bonds for maintaining interhelical contacts (Banci2012Structural).

Upon reduction of disulfide bonds, the protein transitions to a largely unstructured state, leading to aggregation and precipitation over time (Banci2012Structural). CHCHD7 has five isoforms, with some lacking the CHCH domain, which affects their localization and function (Gladyck2021Regulation).

## Function
CHCHD7 is a protein involved in mitochondrial function, specifically within the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. It is a member of the twin CX9C protein family, characterized by a coiled coil-helix-coiled coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which is crucial for its structural stability and function. This domain is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining the protein's conformation and preventing aggregation (Banci2012Structural).

CHCHD7 is homologous to the yeast protein Cox23, which is involved in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly, although the exact role of CHCHD7 in humans is not fully understood (Gladyck2021Regulation; Banci2012Structural). The protein is suggested to be a substrate of the Mia40-dependent import machinery, which facilitates its import into the mitochondrial IMS, where it may participate in oxidative phosphorylation and COX activity regulation (Gladyck2021Regulation; Banci2012Structural).

CHCHD7's structural features, such as high hydrophobicity in its alpha-helices, suggest it may have unique interactions within the mitochondrial environment, potentially influencing mitochondrial integrity and function (Gladyck2021Regulation). However, further studies are needed to elucidate its precise molecular activities and contributions to cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
CHCHD7 is implicated in the development of pleomorphic adenomas (PAs) of the salivary gland through its involvement in gene fusions. The CHCHD7::PLAG1 fusion, resulting from intrachromosomal rearrangements such as paracentric inversions, leads to the activation of the oncogene PLAG1. This activation occurs through promoter swapping, which results in the ectopic overexpression of PLAG1, contributing to tumorigenesis in PAs (Stenman2022Chromosome). The CHCHD7 gene is located on chromosome 8q12, a region frequently involved in translocations in PAs, suggesting that alterations in CHCHD7, such as gene fusions, could be clinically significant in the development of these tumors (Stenman2022Chromosome).

While the context does not provide specific information on diseases directly resulting from CHCHD7 mutations or alterations beyond its role in PAs, the gene's involvement in oncogenic processes through its fusion with PLAG1 in salivary gland tumors is highlighted. The diversity of chromosome 8q12 aberrations in PAs suggests the potential for discovering additional fusion partners involving CHCHD7, which may further elucidate its clinical significance (Stenman2022Chromosome).
