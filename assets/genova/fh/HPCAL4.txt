# HPCAL4

## Overview
HPCAL4 is a gene that encodes the protein hippocalcin-like 4, which is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to bind calcium ions through EF-hand motifs, playing a crucial role in calcium signal transduction within neurons (Girard2015The). The protein hippocalcin-like 4 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of calcium channels and signal transduction pathways, particularly in the nervous system. It is expressed predominantly in interneurons of the spinal cord and has been implicated in the modulation of pain signaling, although its role in pain and itch processing appears to be limited (Alvaro2020Hippocalcinlike). Additionally, HPCAL4 has been identified in protein-protein interaction networks relevant to cancer biology, such as glioblastoma multiforme and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, suggesting its broader significance in cellular signaling and disease contexts (Liu2019Screening; Yang2021Identification).

## Structure
HPCAL4 encodes a protein that is part of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family, characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions (Girard2015The). These motifs are crucial for the protein's role in calcium signal transduction. The protein also features a myristoylated N-terminus, which facilitates its translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, a process linked to the calcium-myristoyl switch unique to NCS proteins (Viviano2016Electrophoretic). This switch involves a conformational rearrangement upon calcium binding, allowing the myristoylated N-terminus to protrude, which is essential for its function (Viviano2016Electrophoretic).

The primary structure of HPCAL4 includes conserved sequences typical of the NCS family, contributing to its specific calcium-binding properties (Girard2015The). While specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of HPCAL4 are not provided, the general characteristics of NCS proteins suggest that they have a unique three-dimensional fold due to the sequestration of the myristoyl group in different protein cavities (Ames2012Molecular). The protein's structure and function may also be influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications for HPCAL4 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
HPCAL4, also known as hippocalcin-like 4, is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of proteins, which are involved in calcium signaling pathways crucial for various cellular processes. These proteins undergo structural changes upon binding calcium, a process that can be detected using electrophoresis in native gels. This calcium-dependent conformational change is linked to the calcium-myristoyl switch, a feature specific to the NCS family, which includes HPCAL4 (Viviano2016Electrophoretic).

HPCAL4 is heavily expressed in interneurons of the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord and contributes to the inactivation of Cav2.1 channels, which are involved in regulating intracellular calcium levels. This regulation plays a role in various cellular processes, including the transmission of nociceptive messages, which are signals related to pain (Alvaro2020Hippocalcinlike). Despite its expression in excitatory interneurons, studies have shown that HPCAL4 has a limited contribution to pain and itch processing, as evidenced by experiments with HPCAL4-deficient mice, which exhibited no major deficits in pain or itch responses (Alvaro2020Hippocalcinlike). This suggests that while HPCAL4 is involved in calcium signaling, its role in pain and itch processing is not significant under normal conditions.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
HPCAL4, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in calcium signaling. In the context of Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) infections, HPCAL4 interacts with the translocated intimin receptor (TIR), a bacterial effector protein. This interaction is part of a broader network of pathogen-host interactions that EHEC effectors use to manipulate host cell processes, such as actin-cytoskeleton reorganization, which is essential for bacterial colonization (Blasche2014The).

HPCAL4 is also identified as a core gene in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) through integrated bioinformatic analysis, suggesting its involvement in a protein-protein interaction network constructed using the STRING database. This network includes 11 core genes, indicating HPCAL4's potential role in signal transduction pathways relevant to cancer biology (Yang2021Identification).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), HPCAL4 is part of a prognostic risk model associated with R-CHOP immunochemotherapy. The gene is implicated in signal transduction functions, although its specific interactions in this context are not fully detailed (Liu2019Screening).
