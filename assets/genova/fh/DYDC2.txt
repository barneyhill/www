# DYDC2

## Overview
The DYDC2 gene encodes the protein DPY30 domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a DPY30 domain, which suggests a role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. While the specific functions of the DPY30 domain containing 2 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its potential involvement in chromatin remodeling complexes. The gene has been studied in the context of several diseases, including myofibrillar myopathy and colon cancer, where it may play a role in disease progression and prognosis (Kuhl2008Myofibrillar; Liang2021Identification). Additionally, DYDC2 has been associated with psychiatric disorders and developmental conditions, highlighting its potential significance in diverse biological pathways (Topa2017On; Oraki2022Genomic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The DYDC2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its involvement in genetic and chromosomal abnormalities. In a study on myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) combined with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC7), the DYDC2 gene was located within a critical region on chromosome 10q22.3, although no disease-causing mutations were identified in its coding regions. The study suggested that regulatory mutations might contribute to a spectrum of myodegenerative disorders affecting skeletal and cardiac muscles (Kuhl2008Myofibrillar).

In the context of cancer, DYDC2 was included in a six-gene prognostic signature for colon cancer, although its individual clinical significance in risk stratification was limited compared to other genes in the model (Liang2021Identification). The gene was also part of a risk model where high expression was associated with a higher risk and worse prognosis in colon cancer (Liang2021Identification).

Additionally, DYDC2 has been identified as a candidate gene with potential effects on the onset and development of bipolar disorder, although specific clinical significance of its mutations was not detailed (Oraki2022Genomic). In a case study involving Kabuki Syndrome, DYDC2 was part of a chromosomal deletion, suggesting its potential involvement in craniosynostosis, although its specific contribution was not detailed (Topa2017On).
