# IL37

## Overview
The IL37 gene encodes interleukin 37 (IL-37), a cytokine belonging to the interleukin-1 family, which plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses. IL-37 is primarily recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties, acting as a suppressor of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The protein is characterized by a conserved β-trefoil fold, typical of IL-1 family cytokines, and exists in multiple isoforms, with IL-37b being the most extensively studied. IL-37 functions by binding to the IL-18 receptor alpha (IL-18Rα) and recruiting IL-1 receptor 8 (IL-1R8), thereby inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. It also interacts with Smad3 to regulate gene transcription, further contributing to its immunosuppressive effects. Clinically, alterations in IL37 expression are linked to various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancers, and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Su2021Current; Cavalli2017Suppression; Dinarello2016Suppression).

## Structure
The IL37 protein, a member of the interleukin-1 family, is characterized by a conserved β-trefoil fold, which is typical of IL-1 family cytokines (Ellisdon2017Homodimerization). This fold consists of 12 β strands and three helices, forming a structure with three pseudorepeats of four β strands each. Two strands from each repeat contribute to a six-stranded β barrel, while the remaining strands form a six-stranded capping region (Ellisdon2017Homodimerization). The β-trefoil fold is closed by interactions between the N-and C-terminal strands (β1 and β12) (Ellisdon2017Homodimerization).

IL37 exists in multiple isoforms, with IL-37b being the most characterized. The precursor form of IL-37b undergoes proteolytic processing, with caspase-1 cleaving it between Asp 20 and Glu 21, and the mature form starting at Val 46 (Ellisdon2017Homodimerization). IL37 can form a head-to-head homodimer, which is an autoregulatory mechanism that limits its bioactivity (Ellisdon2017Homodimerization). The dimer interface involves the β3-β4 loops and the three-stranded β sheet (β2-β3-β11) of each subunit, with key interactions including mainchain hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions (Ellisdon2017Homodimerization).

The monomeric form of IL37 is more effective in reducing inflammation compared to its dimeric form, with mutations at the dimer interface, such as D73K and Y85A, resulting in stable monomeric forms (Eisenmesser2019Interleukin37). IL37 also interacts with heparin, which influences its self-association and activity (Eisenmesser2019Interleukin37).

## Function
Interleukin 37 (IL-37) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and functions as a fundamental suppressor of innate and acquired immune responses. In healthy human cells, IL-37 primarily acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Dinarello2016Suppression).

IL-37 exerts its effects by binding to the IL-18Rα receptor and recruiting IL-1R8, which sequesters MyD88, a key adaptor protein in inflammatory signaling pathways. This interaction prevents MyD88 from participating in IL-1 and IL-18 receptor signaling, thereby suppressing inflammation (Dinarello2016Suppression). The monomeric form of IL-37 is particularly active in reducing inflammation, as it is more effective than the dimeric form in suppressing inflammatory markers (Eisenmesser2019Interleukin37).

IL-37 also influences metabolic pathways by reversing the Warburg effect, decreasing mTOR activity, and increasing AMPK activity, which are associated with reduced inflammation (Dinarello2016Suppression). These molecular activities highlight IL-37's role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the IL37 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), increased IL-37 expression correlates with platelet count and bleeding severity, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Su2021Current). In myasthenia gravis (MG), lower IL-37 levels are linked to more severe disease, indicating its role in suppressing autoimmunity (Su2021Current). In multiple sclerosis (MS), IL-37 expression is insufficient, but its transgenic expression in mice reduces inflammation and neurological deficits, highlighting its therapeutic potential (SánchezFernández2021IL37; Su2021Current).

IL-37 also plays a role in cancer progression. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high IL-37 expression is associated with better overall survival, suggesting a protective role (Christodoulou2022Aberrant). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), IL-37 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and migration, enhancing anti-tumor immune responses (Su2021Current).

In inflammatory diseases, IL-37 expression is altered in conditions like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, where it is considered a promising biomarker and therapeutic target (Pan2020The). Genetic studies have identified rare variants in the IL37 gene associated with gout, particularly in Polynesian populations, which may affect the cytokine's anti-inflammatory properties (Cavalli2017Suppression).

## Interactions
IL-37, a member of the interleukin-1 family, engages in several interactions that contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. It binds to the IL-18 receptor alpha (IL-18Rα) and the IL-1 receptor 8 (IL-1R8), forming a complex that transduces anti-inflammatory signals. This complex formation is crucial for IL-37's function, as it does not recruit the IL-18 receptor beta (IL-18Rβ) chain, unlike IL-18, but instead recruits IL-1R8, which limits downstream signaling of the IL-1 family and TLR pathways (Su2021Current; Cavalli2017Suppression).

IL-37 also interacts with Smad3, forming complexes that translocate into the nucleus to regulate transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant because IL-37 lacks a nuclear localization sequence and requires Smad3 for nuclear translocation. The IL-37-Smad3 complex is essential for inhibiting the expression of inflammatory genes (Su2021Current; Zeng2022Biology).

IL-37 can form homodimers, which attenuate its bioactivity by reducing its ability to bind to IL-18Rα and recruit IL-1R8. This dimerization serves as an autoregulatory mechanism to prevent excessive immunosuppression (Eisenmesser2019Interleukin37; Ellisdon2017Homodimerization).
