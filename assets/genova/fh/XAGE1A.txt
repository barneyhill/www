# XAGE1A

## Overview
XAGE1A is a gene that encodes the protein X antigen family member 1A, which belongs to the cancer/testis antigen family. This protein is predominantly expressed in germ cells and various cancerous tissues, including those of the lung and ovary. As a cancer/testis antigen, X antigen family member 1A is of particular interest in oncology due to its restricted expression pattern in normal tissues and elevated presence in tumors, making it a promising target for cancer immunotherapy and a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The expression of XAGE1A is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, which can lead to its activation in cancer cells (Lim2005Activation; Nakagawa2005XAGE1).

## Clinical Significance
XAGE1A, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is primarily expressed in germ cells and various malignancies, including lung and ovarian cancers. Alterations in its expression have been linked to several cancer types, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. In ovarian cancer, XAGE1A expression is significantly higher in malignant tissues compared to benign tumors, suggesting its utility as a diagnostic biomarker. Higher expression levels are associated with advanced stages of the disease, indicating a potential role in poor prognosis (Jumaa2021Cancer).

In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), XAGE1A expression is observed in tumor tissues and is associated with the presence of antibodies against the protein in patients, suggesting its role as a tumor antigen. This expression pattern highlights its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and as a target for immunotherapy (Nakagawa2005XAGE1). Additionally, XAGE1A expression in lung adenocarcinoma correlates with shorter overall survival, indicating its association with malignancy and potential as a prognostic marker (Ohue2016Survival). The gene's expression is regulated by methylation, with hypomethylation leading to its activation in tumor cells, further implicating its role in cancer development (Lim2005Activation).
