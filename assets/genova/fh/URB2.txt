# URB2

## Overview
URB2 is a gene that encodes the URB2 ribosome biogenesis homolog, a protein integral to the process of ribosome assembly. This protein is categorized as a ribosome biogenesis factor, playing a pivotal role in the early stages of 60S ribosomal subunit assembly. It forms part of a protein subcomplex that is essential for ribosome biogenesis, interacting with other proteins such as Dbp6, Npa1, Nop8, and Rsa3 (Rosado2007Characterization). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, URB2 is implicated in various cellular processes and has been associated with clinical conditions, including hematopoietic defects and glioma, where it serves as a prognostic marker (Cai2018Ribosome; Fang2023URB2). The gene's involvement in these diverse biological and pathological contexts underscores its significance in both cellular function and disease.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the URB2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In zebrafish, a nonsense mutation in the URB2 gene leads to significant hematopoietic defects, including a decrease in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and early T cells, due to compromised cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. These defects are linked to the upregulation of the p53 pathway, and the hematopoietic abnormalities can be rescued by inhibiting this pathway, highlighting the gene's role in HSC development (Cai2018Ribosome).

In humans, URB2 has been identified as a prognostic marker in glioma, a type of brain tumor. High URB2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint molecules in the tumor microenvironment. This suggests its potential as a target for immunotherapy in glioma treatment (Fang2023URB2).

Additionally, a rare variant in the URB2 gene has been associated with increased fasting insulin levels, suggesting a potential link to metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (Mahajan2015Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of URB2 in various pathological contexts.

## Interactions
URB2, also known as the URB2 ribosome biogenesis homolog, is involved in several protein-protein interactions essential for ribosome biogenesis. It is part of a subcomplex that includes proteins such as Dbp6, Npa1 (Urb1), Nop8, and Rsa3, which are crucial for the early steps of 60S ribosomal subunit assembly. This subcomplex is independent of RNA, as demonstrated by its stability even after RNase treatment, which degrades RNA (Rosado2007Characterization). 

URB2 interacts with these proteins to form a complex with a molecular mass of about 550 to 600 kDa, and a larger complex of about 1 MDa when RNA is present. This indicates that URB2 is involved in ribosome biogenesis through its interactions with these proteins, forming a complex that is crucial for the early stages of 60S ribosomal subunit assembly (Rosado2007Characterization). 

In the context of glioma, URB2 has been identified as interacting with a network of proteins, including UFM1, C11orf54, SNRPC, SAV1, NOL8, URB1, NIP7, UTP15, RRS1, and MAK16, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes (Fang2023URB2). These interactions highlight URB2's role in both ribosome biogenesis and broader cellular functions.
