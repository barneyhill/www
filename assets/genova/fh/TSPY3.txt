# TSPY3

## Overview
TSPY3 is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes the testis-specific protein Y-linked 3. This protein is part of the TSPY gene family, which is known for its role in male germ cell development and spermatogenesis. The TSPY3 protein is categorized as a testis-specific protein, indicating its expression is predominantly restricted to the testes. It is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation within the male reproductive system. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of TSPY3 remain under investigation, but it is thought to be involved in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which plays a role in testicular development and function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
