# TOPBP1

## Overview
TOPBP1, or DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and the DNA damage response. The protein, characterized by its multiple BRCT (BRCA1 C Terminus) domains, plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for cellular responses to DNA damage. As a scaffold protein, TOPBP1 is integral in assembling complexes that activate the ATR kinase, a key player in the DNA damage response pathway, and in regulating the initiation of DNA replication. Its interactions with various proteins, including the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) clamp and ATRIP, underscore its importance in cellular survival and replication stress management (Day2024TopBP1; Mordes2008TopBP1). Additionally, TOPBP1's involvement in transcriptional regulation, particularly through its interaction with the transcription factor E2F1, highlights its role in cell cycle control and apoptosis (Liu2004TopBP1). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with cancer and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, where its expression levels and genetic variants influence disease progression and patient outcomes (de2014WholeExome; Forma2013Association).

## Structure
TOPBP1 is a scaffold protein characterized by the presence of multiple BRCT (BRCA1 C Terminus) domains, which are crucial for its role in DNA replication, repair, and checkpoint signaling. The protein contains nine BRCT domains, arranged in unique configurations that facilitate various protein-protein interactions. The N-terminal region of TOPBP1 includes three BRCT domains, named BRCT0, BRCT1, and BRCT2, forming an elongated cylinder-like structure. BRCT0 is unique to human TOPBP1 and lacks a phosphopeptide binding pocket, potentially providing a binding surface for unknown partners or stabilizing the BRCT1 + 2 pair (Huo2010Crystal; Wardlaw2014TopBP1:).

The BRCT domains are involved in phospho-specific interactions, allowing dynamic regulation through phosphorylation. For instance, the BRCT1 domain binds phosphorylated motifs, such as the Ser387 site on RAD9, which is essential for DNA damage response (Day2018BRCT). The BRCT4 domain interacts with the GINS complex, crucial for DNA replication initiation, highlighting the importance of these domains in cellular processes (Day2024TopBP1).

TOPBP1's structure also includes a GINI region between the BRCT3 and BRCT4 domains, which is highly conserved and essential for binding to the GINS complex, supporting genome replication (Day2024TopBP1).

## Function
TOPBP1 (DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1) is a crucial protein involved in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in DNA replication, repair, and the DNA damage response. TOPBP1 acts as a scaffold protein, assembling various protein complexes through its multiple BRCT domains, which bind phosphorylated residues in target proteins. This function is essential for initiating DNA replication by facilitating the loading of CDC45 to the pre-initiation complex, thereby activating the replicative helicase CMG complex and initiating DNA synthesis (Sokka2018The).

TOPBP1 is also a key activator of the ATR kinase, which is vital for the DNA damage response. It helps suppress the firing of replication origins during the S phase, preventing replication stress and ensuring proper replication fork dynamics (Sokka2018The). In mitosis, TOPBP1 is involved in mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS), a process that completes DNA replication in early mitosis and is crucial for resolving replication stress-induced homologous recombination intermediates (Bagge2021Functions).

Additionally, TOPBP1 regulates E2F1, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It represses E2F1's transcriptional activity, preventing excessive apoptosis and promoting cell survival during normal growth and DNA damage (Liu2004TopBP1). This regulation is independent of the retinoblastoma protein and involves recruiting chromatin-remodeling complexes to E2F1-responsive promoters (Liu2004TopBP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TOPBP1 gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). In cancer, TOPBP1 is often overexpressed, contributing to genomic instability and tumor progression. This overexpression is linked to poor survival rates and high-grade tumors in breast cancer, where it interacts with mutant p53 to promote cancerous growth and chemoresistance (Forma2013Association; Liu2011TopBP1). A specific polymorphism, rs115160714, in the 3' UTR of the TOPBP1 gene is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, affecting mRNA stability and protein levels (Forma2013Association).

In IPAH, reduced expression of TOPBP1 is observed in vascular lesions and pulmonary endothelial cells, suggesting its role as a genetic modifier in the disease. This deficiency increases susceptibility to DNA damage and apoptosis, potentially contributing to the progressive loss of pulmonary microvessels characteristic of IPAH (de2014WholeExome). The study identified three single-nucleotide variants in TOPBP1 that may be significant due to their location in conserved regions, although their exact impact remains uncertain (de2014WholeExome).

## Interactions
TOPBP1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA replication and the DNA damage response. It activates the ATR kinase through its interaction with ATRIP, a regulatory partner of ATR. This interaction is essential for ATR activation and cellular survival following replication stress (Mordes2008TopBP1). TOPBP1 also interacts with the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) clamp, which recruits TOPBP1 to stalled replication forks, facilitating ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation (Delacroix2007The).

TOPBP1 forms nuclear condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation, which are essential for activating ATR/Chk1 signaling. These condensates are permeable to DNA, indicating interactions with nucleic acids (Frattini2021TopBP1). The protein also interacts with E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, through its BRCT domain. This interaction is crucial for repressing E2F1's transcriptional activity and apoptosis-inducing capability (Liu2004TopBP1).

TOPBP1's interaction with ATRIP is stabilized by ATRIP's C-terminal ATR-interacting domain, and specific domains of ATRIP are crucial for its interaction with TOPBP1 and ATR activation (Mordes2008TopBP1). These interactions highlight TOPBP1's role as a scaffold in the DNA damage response pathway.
