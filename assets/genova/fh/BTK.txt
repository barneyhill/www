# BTK

## Overview
Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a gene that encodes the protein Bruton tyrosine kinase, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase critical for B-cell development and function. The BTK protein is involved in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, where it plays a pivotal role in B-cell maturation, proliferation, and survival. Structurally, BTK comprises several domains, including the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, Tec homology (TH) domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain, which facilitate its interactions and activation (Kuglstatter2011Insights; Marcotte2010Structures). Mutations in the BTK gene can lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a condition marked by a lack of mature B cells and increased susceptibility to infections (Conley1998Mutations). Additionally, BTK is implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, making it a target for therapeutic interventions (Alu2022BTK).

## Structure
Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of BTK consists of a sequence of amino acids that form various domains, including the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, Tec homology (TH) domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain (Kuglstatter2011Insights; Marcotte2010Structures).

The secondary structure of BTK features alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly within the PH domain, which is composed of a seven-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and a C-terminal alpha helix (Hyvonen1997Structure; Baraldi1999Structure). The PH domain also contains a zinc-binding site crucial for structural stability (Hyvonen1997Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, BTK adopts a compact conformation in its autoinhibited state, stabilized by interactions between the SH2 and SH3 domains (Wang2015Autoinhibition). The PH-TH module plays a critical role in membrane binding and activation, interacting with phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) (Wang2019Structural; Wang2015Autoinhibition).

BTK undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, which are essential for its activation (Kuglstatter2011Insights). Mutations in BTK can lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia, affecting its function and stability (Hyvonen1997Structure).

## Function
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in B-cell development and function. It is primarily involved in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, where it is activated upon BCR engagement. This activation is crucial for B-cell maturation, proliferation, and survival (de1994Bcell; Petro2000Bruton’s). BTK is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, which enhances its catalytic activity and leads to autophosphorylation, further promoting BCR signaling (Satterthwaite1998Btk).

BTK is essential for the activation of several downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ) pathways. These pathways lead to the production of second messengers that activate protein kinase C (PKC) and increase intracellular calcium levels, which are vital for B-cell activation and function (Petro2000Bruton’s; Qiu2000Signaling). BTK also plays a role in the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in B-cell growth and survival (Petro2000Bruton’s).

In healthy human cells, BTK is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of B-cells, where it facilitates signal transduction and cytoskeletal reorganization, contributing to cell motility and apoptosis regulation (Qiu2000Signaling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BTK gene are primarily associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a condition characterized by a near-complete absence of B cells due to developmental arrest at the pre-B cell stage. This results in very low serum immunoglobulin levels and a high susceptibility to infections with encapsulated bacteria. Patients with XLA require lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy (Crofford2016The; Conley1998Mutations). The BTK gene mutations include single-base-pair substitutions, small insertions or deletions, and more complex insertion/deletion combinations, often leading to amino acid substitutions, premature stop codons, splice defects, and frameshifts (Rohrer1999Unusual; Conley1998Mutations).

Alterations in BTK expression are also implicated in autoimmune diseases. Overexpression of BTK can lead to systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease, characterized by spontaneous germinal centers and autoantibody formation. Conversely, reduced BTK expression can prevent autoantibody production and autoimmune syndromes in certain mouse models (Crofford2016The). BTK is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, where its activation leads to the production of autoreactive antibodies and inflammatory cytokines (Alu2022BTK). BTK inhibitors have shown potential in reducing these effects in preclinical and clinical studies (Alu2022BTK).

## Interactions
Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily through its various domains. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of BTK is responsible for targeting the plasma membrane and forms a homodimer, with each molecule binding phosphatidylinositol in the binding pocket (Liang2018The). BTK interacts with SRC family kinases, such as LYN and FYN, which significantly increase BTK's tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity (Rawlings1996Activation). The interaction with LYN is crucial for BTK activation, as LYN phosphorylates BTK at tyrosine residue 551, leading to its activation (Rawlings1996Activation).

BTK also interacts with protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates BTK on serine residues, modulating its activity. This interaction is mediated by the PH domain of BTK, which binds directly to PKC (Yao1994The). PKC phosphorylation decreases BTK's autophosphorylation ability, indicating an inhibitory role (Yao1994The).

In B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, BTK interacts with CD79A and CD79B, components of the BCR complex, and phosphorylates phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), leading to calcium mobilization and activation of downstream pathways (Buggy2012Bruton). These interactions highlight BTK's role in integrating signals from various receptors and pathways.
