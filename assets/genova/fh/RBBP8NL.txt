# RBBP8NL

## Overview
RBBP8NL is a protein-coding gene that encodes the RBBP8 N-terminal like protein, which plays a significant role in cellular processes related to skin and immune function. The protein is involved in the regulation of immune responses and keratinocyte differentiation, particularly in normal human primary keratinocytes (NHPK). It is implicated in antiviral defense mechanisms, as its silencing leads to increased replication of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and affects the expression of immune-related molecules such as type I interferon IFNk and the inflammatory cytokine IL1b (Yi2024Rbbp8nl; Bin2021Whole). The RBBP8 N-terminal like protein is active in the extracellular space, where it interacts with other cellular components to influence keratinocyte biology and immune regulation (Yi2024Rbbp8nl). Additionally, the gene has clinical significance in cancer, particularly in bladder and breast cancers, where its expression levels are associated with tumor microenvironment characteristics and responses to immunotherapy (Yi2024Rbbp8nl).

## Function
RBBP8NL (RBBP8 N-terminal like) is a protein-coding gene involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of skin and immune function. In healthy human cells, specifically normal human primary keratinocytes (NHPK), RBBP8NL plays a significant role in regulating immune responses and keratinocyte differentiation. Silencing RBBP8NL in these cells leads to increased replication of HSV-1, a common viral pathogen, indicating its role in antiviral defense (Yi2024Rbbp8nl; Bin2021Whole). This gene also influences the expression of type I interferon IFNk and the inflammatory cytokine IL1b, suggesting its involvement in modulating immune responses (Bin2021Whole).

RBBP8NL is crucial for the normal differentiation of keratinocytes, as its silencing results in decreased expression of differentiation markers such as filaggrin (FLG), keratin 10 (KRT10), and loricrin (LOR) (Yi2024Rbbp8nl; Bin2021Whole). This impaired differentiation may contribute to increased viral replication, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining skin barrier integrity and function. The protein encoded by RBBP8NL is active in the extracellular space, where it likely interacts with other cellular components to exert its effects on keratinocyte biology and immune regulation (Yi2024Rbbp8nl).

## Clinical Significance
The RBBP8NL gene is clinically significant due to its role in cancer, particularly bladder and breast cancers, where it is overexpressed compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is linked to a non-inflamed tumor microenvironment and reduced infiltration of CD8+ T cells, contributing to resistance to anticancer immunotherapy (Yi2024Rbbp8nl). In bladder cancer, high RBBP8NL expression is associated with downregulation of MHC molecules and decreased activity in the cancer immunity cycle, leading to reduced infiltration of various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and macrophages. This results in a lower response rate to immune checkpoint blockade therapy and an increased likelihood of hyperprogression (Yi2024Rbbp8nl).

RBBP8NL expression is also linked to different molecular subtypes of bladder cancer. Low expression is associated with the basal subtype, which shows better responses to immunotherapy, while high expression is linked to the luminal subtype, which is less responsive due to oncogenic pathway enrichment (Yi2024Rbbp8nl). The gene's expression patterns and immunological associations suggest its potential as a predictive biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for personalized cancer immunotherapy (Yi2024Rbbp8nl).
