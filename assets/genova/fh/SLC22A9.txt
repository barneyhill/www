# SLC22A9

## Overview
SLC22A9 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 9, also known as organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7). This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is characterized by its role as a transmembrane transporter. OAT7 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it is localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, facilitating the transport of organic anions, including conjugated sex hormones and short-chain fatty acids (Nies2020The; Yee2021Emerging). The protein's structure, featuring 12 α-helical transmembrane domains, allows it to function as a polyspecific transporter, capable of translocating various substrates (Engelhart2020Systems; Volk2013OCTs). SLC22A9 plays a significant role in the metabolism of estrogen precursors, which are crucial for maintaining bone health, and has been studied for its potential association with osteoporosis (Nies2020The; Ahn2015Polymorphisms).

## Structure
The SLC22A9 protein, also known as OAT7, is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is characterized by a common membrane topology featuring 12 α-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Engelhart2020Systems; Volk2013OCTs). These TMDs are integral to the protein's function in transporting organic anions across cell membranes. The protein also includes a large extracellular loop between TMDs 1 and 2, which is glycosylated and contains conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, potentially playing a role in oligomerization (Volk2013OCTs). An intracellular loop between TMDs 6 and 7 contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, which regulate transporter activity (Volk2013OCTs).

SLC22A9 is part of the OATS4 subgroup, which is associated with the transport of conjugated sex hormones and short-chain fatty acids (Engelhart2020Systems). The protein's structure allows it to function as a polyspecific transporter, capable of translocating various substrates with different molecular structures (Volk2013OCTs). Despite these insights, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of SLC22A9 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The SLC22A9 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7), which is part of the solute carrier family 22. This transporter is primarily expressed in the liver, where it is localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes (Nies2020The; Yee2021Emerging). OAT7 is involved in the transport of estrone sulfate, a major circulating estrogen metabolite, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, both of which are conjugated sex steroids (Koepsell2013The; Ahn2015Polymorphisms). The transport of these sulfated steroids is significant because they serve as precursors to active estrogens, which play a crucial role in maintaining bone mass and overall bone health (Nies2020The; Ahn2015Polymorphisms).

SLC22A9 is part of the OATS4 subgroup, which is associated with the transport of conjugated sex hormones and short-chain fatty acids (Engelhart2020Systems). The transporter is described as oligo-specific, indicating it has a limited range of substrates, primarily focusing on conjugated sex steroids (Engelhart2020Systems). The expression and function of SLC22A9 in the liver suggest its role in the regulation of estrogen metabolism, which is essential for maintaining hormonal balance and bone health (Yee2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC22A9 gene, which encodes the organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7), has been investigated in relation to osteoporosis. A study conducted on Korean females suggested a potential association between polymorphisms in SLC22A9 and osteoporosis, identifying specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may affect the transport function of the protein, such as the F426S variant, which could influence the transport of estrone sulfate, a precursor of estrogen important for bone health (Ahn2015Polymorphisms). However, a separate study in a large European cohort found no significant association between SLC22A9 variants and osteoporosis-related outcomes, suggesting that these variants do not have a major impact on osteoporosis risk prediction in Europeans (Nies2020The).

The SLC22A9 gene is also part of the broader SLC22 family, which includes transporters involved in drug metabolism and excretion. While specific clinical implications of SLC22A9 mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in hepatic and renal transport suggests potential relevance in conditions related to drug-induced toxicity or altered pharmacokinetics (Koepsell2013The; Yee2021Emerging).
