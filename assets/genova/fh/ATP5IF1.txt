# ATP5IF1

## Overview
ATP5IF1 is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (IF1), a regulatory protein involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. IF1 is categorized as an inhibitory factor and plays a critical role in modulating the activity of mitochondrial ATP synthase, an enzyme essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The protein is structurally disordered in its nascent form but adopts an α-helical conformation upon maturation, featuring distinct domains for inhibition and dimerization. IF1's primary function is to inhibit both the ATP synthetic and hydrolytic activities of ATP synthase, thereby influencing mitochondrial structure and function, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and has significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, where IF1 expression is often altered (DomínguezZorita2022The; EsparzaMoltó2018Tissue‐specific).

## Structure
The ATP5IF1 gene encodes the ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1), a protein that regulates the activity of mitochondrial ATP synthase. IF1 is a small, structurally disordered protein that becomes an α-helical protein upon maturation. The mature IF1 contains an inhibitory domain at the N-terminus and a dimerization domain at the C-terminus (GarcíaAguilar2018A). The inhibitory domain interacts with the ATP synthase in a 1:1 ratio, particularly binding to the αβ interface in the F1 domain of the enzyme (DomínguezZorita2023The).

The structure of an inhibitory peptide derived from IF1, known as I1-60His, has been solved when bound to the F1 domain of ATP synthase. This peptide docks in a groove between the α-helices of the α and β subunits, extending to the γ subunit of the central stalk (GarcíaAguilar2018A). IF1 can form oligomers, such as dimers or tetramers, influenced by pH and cation effects (RomeroCarramiñana2023IF1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating IF1's activity. Phosphorylation of serine 39 (S39) prevents IF1 from binding to ATP synthase, thus abolishing its inhibitory function (EsparzaMoltó2018Tissue‐specific).

## Function
ATP5IF1, also known as ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1, is a crucial regulator of mitochondrial ATP synthase, an enzyme essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria. In healthy human cells, ATP5IF1 plays a significant role in modulating the balance between OXPHOS and glycolysis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and brain (DomínguezZorita2022The). The protein inhibits both the ATP synthetic and hydrolytic activities of ATP synthase, thereby regulating mitochondrial structure and function (DomínguezZorita2022The).

ATP5IF1 is involved in mitochondrial retrograde signaling, which reprograms nuclear gene expression and is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis (DomínguezZorita2022The). It contributes to the organization of ATP synthase by promoting its oligomerization, crucial for the formation and stability of mitochondrial cristae, thus preserving cristae structure and protecting cells from apoptotic death under toxic conditions (DomínguezZorita2022The). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its ability to inhibit ATP synthase, allowing for efficient ATP production during high energy demand situations (DomínguezZorita2022The). This regulation is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and impacts processes like metabolism and cell survival.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ATP5IF1 gene, which encodes the ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. IF1 is overexpressed in various carcinomas, including those of the colon, lung, breast, and ovary, where it contributes to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells towards a glycolytic phenotype, known as the Warburg effect. This shift is associated with mitochondrial hyperpolarization and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote cell proliferation and survival through pathways like NFκB (SánchezCenizo2010Upregulation; DomínguezZorita2023The; Formentini2012The).

In some cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, high levels of IF1 are linked to poor prognosis due to its role in promoting angiogenesis and metastasis. Conversely, in breast, colon, and lung cancers, high IF1 expression correlates with a better prognosis, acting as a tumor suppressor by restraining oxidative phosphorylation and enhancing glycolysis (DomínguezZorita2023The). The regulation of IF1 involves post-transcriptional mechanisms, including interactions with RNA-binding proteins like LRPPRC, which affect ATP synthase activity and cellular ATP production (EsparzaMoltó2018Tissue‐specific; DomínguezZorita2023The). Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for developing potential therapeutic interventions targeting IF1 in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
ATP5IF1, also known as ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1, interacts with several components of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. It binds specifically to the OSCP subunit of ATP synthase, a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This interaction is significant in protecting cancer cells from apoptosis by desensitizing them to the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), a process that can lead to cell death (Galber2023The). The binding of IF1 to the OSCP subunit involves the N-terminal region of IF1, which transiently adopts a helical structure to facilitate this interaction (Galber2023The).

IF1 also interacts with the β subunit of ATP synthase, although this interaction is not as prominent as with the OSCP subunit (Galber2023The). In addition to its interactions with ATP synthase, IF1 is involved in metabolic reprogramming through its interactions with transcription factors such as c-Myc and PGC1a. It binds to phosphorylated c-Myc, potentially mediating c-Myc activity and promoting glycolysis, and interacts with PGC1a, inhibiting oxidative respiration (Guo2023FATP). These interactions highlight IF1's role in regulating cellular energy metabolism and its potential impact on cancer cell survival.
