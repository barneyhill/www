# TMEM239

## Overview
TMEM239 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 239, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of viral infections. TMEM239 is notably involved in the entry of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) into host cells, where it interacts with key proteins such as Rab5A and the viral protein pE248R, facilitating the virus's entry into early endosomes (Shen2024A). Beyond its role in viral entry, TMEM239 is associated with numerous cellular proteins, suggesting its involvement in small GTPase-mediated signal transduction and transmembrane transport pathways (Shen2024A). These interactions highlight the gene's potential significance in both viral pathogenesis and normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TMEM239, a transmembrane protein, plays a significant role in the entry of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) into early endosomes. It interacts with the early endosomal marker Rab5A, which is crucial for endosomal transport. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, indicating a robust co-localization signal between TMEM239 and Rab5A (Shen2024A). TMEM239 also interacts with the viral protein pE248R, which is involved in early post-entry events of ASFV, suggesting that TMEM239 facilitates ASFV entry into host cells (Shen2024A).

In uninfected cells, TMEM239 interacts with a variety of cellular proteins. A pulldown assay and LC-MS analysis identified 62 cellular proteins that interact with TMEM239, while 35 host proteins were identified in infected cells. These interactions are linked to pathways involved in small GTPase-mediated signal transduction and transmembrane transport (Shen2024A). Despite these interactions, no viral proteins were detected in the pulldown assays, highlighting the specificity of TMEM239's interactions with host proteins (Shen2024A). These findings underscore the importance of TMEM239 in ASFV infection and its potential role in cellular signaling and transport processes.
