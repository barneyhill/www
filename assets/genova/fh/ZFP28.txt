# ZFP28

## Overview
ZFP28 is a gene that encodes the ZFP28 zinc finger protein, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. ZFP28 is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of circadian rhythms and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. It is expressed in a range of adult and embryonic tissues, indicating its role in both development and adult physiology (Yajima2009Zinc; Schick2016Identifying). The protein interacts with other key transcription factors and is part of a complex network that influences chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Sudhir2016ProteomicsBased). Additionally, ZFP28 has been studied in the context of cancer, where its expression levels are altered in certain types of tumors, suggesting potential clinical significance (Sobocińska2022Zinc).

## Function
ZFP28 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, playing a role in the regulation of gene expression. It is expressed in various adult tissues and shows development-specific expression in embryonic tissues (Schick2016Identifying). In healthy cells, ZFP28 is cyclically expressed and is regulated by core clock factors such as Bmal1 and Clock, indicating its involvement in circadian rhythm regulation (Schick2016Identifying). ZFP28 cycles in phase with classical circadian genes like Period and Cryptochrome, suggesting it may influence the core clock network (Schick2016Identifying).

In the liver, ZFP28 is bound at the promoter by Clock or Bmal1, and knock-down experiments have shown that reducing ZFP28 expression shortens the period of Bmal1 oscillations, highlighting its potential role in maintaining circadian rhythm stability (Schick2016Identifying). While the specific function of ZFP28 in healthy cells is not fully detailed, its expression in melanocytes suggests a role in normal melanocyte function (Yajima2009Zinc). Further research is needed to elucidate the complete range of molecular processes and cellular functions influenced by ZFP28.

## Clinical Significance
ZFP28, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various cancer-related processes due to alterations in its expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), ZFP28 is generally downregulated compared to healthy tissues, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (Sobocińska2022Zinc). The expression of ZFP28 is influenced by several clinical factors, including tumor location, patient age, and lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking (Sobocińska2022Zinc). Notably, ZFP28 expression is lower in tumors with higher T stages and in older patients, but it increases in high-grade tumors (G3 + G4) (Sobocińska2022Zinc).

Despite these associations, ZFP28 expression does not significantly correlate with overall survival or disease-free interval outcomes in HNSCC patients (Sobocińska2022Zinc). Additionally, ZFP28 is involved in the p53 pathway, interacting with the p53 binding protein p53bp1, which suggests a role in cancer-related processes (Munro2018Two). However, the specific clinical significance of ZFP28 mutations remains unclear, as studies have primarily focused on expression levels rather than genetic mutations (Sobocińska2022Zinc).

## Interactions
ZFP28, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its function as a transcription factor. The interactome of ZFP28 has been studied in the context of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs), which are known for their role in repressing transposable elements during early embryogenesis. ZFP28, like other KZFPs, recruits KAP1, a scaffold protein for heterochromatin-inducing complexes, although some KZFPs with additional domains may not bind KAP1, indicating a diversity in interaction partners (Helleboid2019The).

In embryonic stem cells, ZFP28 is part of a network of proteins associated with pluripotency. It interacts with key transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, which are crucial for maintaining stem cell pluripotency. ZFP28 is included in the interactome of these factors, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Sudhir2016ProteomicsBased).

The BioPlex 3.0 project, which maps the human interactome, includes ZFP28 among the proteins analyzed, although specific interactions within multiprotein complexes are not detailed in the available data (Huttlin2020Dual). These studies highlight the complex network of interactions in which ZFP28 participates, reflecting its functional versatility.
