# SLC4A11

## Overview
The SLC4A11 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 4 member 11, which is a transmembrane transporter primarily involved in ion transport and pH regulation. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 4 but is distinct in its function as it does not transport bicarbonate, unlike other family members. Instead, SLC4A11 facilitates the electrogenic cotransport of ammonia (NH3) and protons (H+), playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the corneal endothelium and kidney (Zhang2015Human; Lu2023Structural). The protein's structure includes multiple transmembrane segments and potential glycosylation sites, which are essential for its function and stability (Vilas2011A). Mutations in the SLC4A11 gene are associated with several corneal dystrophies, such as congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Chibani2021Autosomal; Bonanno2022The).

## Structure
The SLC4A11 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 4 and is implicated in corneal dystrophies. It is a plasma membrane protein with a unique structure compared to other SLC4 family members, as it does not transport bicarbonate but is involved in NH3/H+ electrogenic cotransport (Lu2023Structural). The protein is composed of 891 amino acids and is predicted to span the membrane 14 times, with both the N- and C-termini oriented towards the cytosol (Vilas2011A). 

The SLC4A11 protein structure includes a cytosolic N-terminal domain (residues 1-374), a membrane domain (residues 375-873) with 14 transmembrane segments, and a short cytosolic C-terminal domain (residues 874-891) (Vilas2011A). The protein has five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, with Asn 545 and Asn 553 likely being glycosylated (Vilas2011A). 

Mutations in SLC4A11 often occur at helix-helix interfaces within the membrane domain, affecting helix packing and leading to protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Badior2016SLC4A11). The protein's dimeric interface is formed by interactions between transmembrane segments TM5, TM6, and TM7 (Badior2016SLC4A11).

## Function
The SLC4A11 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transporter involved in various molecular processes crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, SLC4A11 is primarily active in the corneal endothelium and kidney, where it plays a significant role in ion transport and pH regulation. It is known to facilitate the transport of ammonia (NH3) and protons (H+) across cell membranes, acting as an NH3/H+ co-transporter. This activity is essential for maintaining ammonia and proton balance within cells, contributing to cellular homeostasis and pH regulation (Zhang2015Human).

SLC4A11 is also involved in the transport of H+ ions, functioning as an electrogenic H+ transporter that is activated by ammonia and alkaline pH. This function is crucial for maintaining corneal stromal hydration, which is necessary for corneal transparency and clear vision (Bonanno2022The). The protein is implicated in glutamine catabolism at the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it helps suppress mitochondrial superoxide production, thereby mitigating oxidative stress (Bonanno2022The).

In the corneal endothelium, SLC4A11 is associated with the transport of lactate and H+ ions, contributing to the maintenance of pH balance and supporting lactate efflux, which is vital for corneal health (Bonanno2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC4A11 gene are linked to several corneal dystrophies, including congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED), Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), and Harboyan syndrome. CHED is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bilateral corneal clouding and visual impairment, often evident at birth or early in life. It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in SLC4A11, leading to corneal endothelial dysfunction and edema (Chibani2021Autosomal; Hemadevi2008Identification). Harboyan syndrome, also known as corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness (CDPD), involves CHED with progressive sensorineuronal hearing loss, attributed to SLC4A11 mutations affecting both the cornea and cochlea (Desir2007Borate; Malhotra2019Human).

FECD is associated with heterozygous mutations in SLC4A11, which may lead to the formation of wild-type mutant heterodimers, affecting protein trafficking and function. This condition typically manifests later in life and involves progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells, resulting in corneal edema and vision impairment (Vithana2007SLC4A11; Bonanno2022The). Some SLC4A11 mutations also cause misfolding and retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to disease pathology (Alka2018Molecular).

## Interactions
SLC4A11, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function and regulation. It forms dimers and can interact with both wild-type and mutant forms of itself, creating heterodimers. This oligomerization is significant in the context of corneal dystrophies, such as Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy (CHED2), where the presence of wild-type SLC4A11 can facilitate the maturation of certain mutant proteins (Vilas2011Oligomerization).

SLC4A11 also interacts with components of Descemet's membrane (DM), particularly through its third extracellular loop (EL3). This loop is crucial for the adhesion of corneal endothelial cells to DM, interacting predominantly with collagen type VIII alpha chains 1 and 2. Mutations in EL3 can impair this adhesion, which is a key factor in the pathology of endothelial corneal dystrophies (Malhotra2019Defective).

The protein's interaction with stilbenedisulfonate compounds, such as SITS and H2 DIDS, suggests that SLC4A11 has a single binding site for these inhibitors, similar to other SLC4 family members. This interaction is dependent on the protein's folded conformation (Vilas2011A).
