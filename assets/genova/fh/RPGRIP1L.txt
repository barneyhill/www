# RPGRIP1L

## Overview
RPGRIP1L is a gene that encodes a protein integral to ciliary function, particularly within the ciliary transition zone. The RPGRIP1L protein is a multi-domain entity that plays a pivotal role in regulating proteasomal activity and autophagy at the primary cilium, a key cellular organelle involved in signal transduction. It is characterized by its interaction with various proteins, including the molecular motor myosin Va and the proteasomal subunit Psmd2, which are essential for maintaining ciliary length and function. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and its association with ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, when mutated. These conditions highlight the critical role of RPGRIP1L in developmental and cellular processes, particularly those related to ciliary signaling and autophagy (Struchtrup2018The; Gerhardt2015The; Khanna2009A).

## Structure
RPGRIP1L is a multi-domain protein involved in ciliary function, featuring several structural domains that facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions. It contains three C2 domains, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as the molecular motor myosin Va (MyoVa). These C2 domains, particularly the C2 NTERM and C2 CTERM, show high affinity for MyoVa's globular tail domain, indicating their importance in ciliary processes (Assis2017The).

The protein also includes coiled-coil regions, which are essential for its localization and interaction with transition zone (TZ) modules, such as the Meckel syndrome (MKS) and nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins. These interactions are vital for establishing the ciliary zone of exclusion (CIZE) and maintaining ciliary function (Jensen2015Formation).

RPGRIP1L is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions, although phosphorylation at specific residues like S1652 does not prevent its binding to MyoVa (Assis2017The). The protein may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Vössing2021The).

## Function
The RPGRIP1L gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating proteasomal activity at the primary cilium, a cellular structure involved in signal transduction. This protein is localized at the ciliary transition zone and is essential for maintaining normal proteasomal activity specifically at the ciliary base, rather than affecting total cellular proteasomal activity (Gerhardt2015The). RPGRIP1L interacts with the 19S proteasomal subunit component Psmd2, which is significant for controlling the activity of the ciliary proteasome and maintaining normal ciliary length and function (Gerhardt2015The). In RPGRIP1L-deficient cells, there is an accumulation of proteins like ZsProSensor-1 at the ciliary base, indicating decreased proteasomal activity, which suggests that RPGRIP1L is crucial for the degradation of proteins involved in cellular processes at the ciliary base (Gerhardt2015The).

RPGRIP1L is also involved in autophagy regulation, independently of its role in proteasomal activity. It influences autophagic activity by controlling the initiation of autophagy through the regulation of MTOR signaling, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis (Struchtrup2018The). The gene's dysfunction can lead to ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions related to cilia and autophagy (Struchtrup2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPGRIP1L gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JS) and Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS). These conditions are characterized by developmental abnormalities due to defects in ciliary function. In Joubert syndrome, mutations in RPGRIP1L can lead to symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and renal disease, as seen in a case study of a boy with novel compound heterozygous mutations in the gene (Li2023A). The RPGRIP1L gene is also implicated in retinal degeneration, particularly in the context of ciliopathies like Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) and Senior-Loken Syndrome (SLS). A specific allele, A229T, has been identified as a modifier of retinal degeneration, affecting the interaction between RPGRIP1L and the ciliary protein RPGR, which is crucial for normal retinal function (Khanna2009A).

Alterations in RPGRIP1L expression or function can disrupt ciliary signaling pathways, contributing to these diseases. The gene's role in regulating proteasomal activity at the primary cilium is crucial for maintaining proper ciliary function, and its deficiency can lead to impaired degradation of specific proteins, affecting ciliary signaling pathways (Gerhardt2015The).

## Interactions
RPGRIP1L is involved in several protein interactions crucial for ciliary function. It interacts with the molecular motor myosin Va (MyoVa) at the centrosome, where the C2 domains of RPGRIP1L bind to the globular tail domain of MyoVa. This interaction is important for ciliogenesis and is characterized by transient protein-protein interactions with low micromolar affinity (Assis2017The). RPGRIP1L also interacts with Psmd2, a component of the proteasomal 19S subunit, at the ciliary transition zone. This interaction regulates proteasomal activity specifically at the ciliary base, which is essential for proper ciliary signaling and function (Gerhardt2015The).

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, RPGRIP1L influences autophagy through its effect on MTOR signaling, independently of its role in proteasomal regulation. RPGRIP1L deficiency leads to increased MTORC1 signaling, which negatively regulates autophagy (Struchtrup2018The). RPGRIP1L also interacts with RPGR isoforms, which are important for the formation and functioning of the ciliary transition zone, although it does not interact with all RPGR isoforms (Vössing2021The). These interactions highlight RPGRIP1L's role in maintaining ciliary structure and function, as well as its involvement in ciliopathies.
