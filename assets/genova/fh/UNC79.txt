# UNC79

## Overview
The UNC79 gene encodes the unc-79 homolog, a protein that serves as a subunit of the NALCN channel complex, which is integral to the regulation of sodium ion flow in neurons. This protein is categorized as a component of a transmembrane channel complex, playing a pivotal role in maintaining neuronal excitability and resting membrane potential. The UNC79 protein forms a heterodimer with UNC80, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of the NALCN channelosome. This complex is essential for various physiological processes, including motor function, pain sensitivity, and circadian rhythm regulation. Disruptions in the UNC79 gene or its protein product have been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Lu2010Extracellular; Kang2022Structure; Zhou2022Architecture).

## Structure
The UNC79 protein is a component of the NALCN channel complex, forming a heterodimer with UNC80. This complex is crucial for the function of the NALCN channel, which regulates sodium ion flow in neurons. The structure of UNC79 includes 72 cytosolic helices that pack into HEAT and ARM repeats, serving as basic building blocks. These helices form a wave-shaped structure through supercoiled arrangements, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Kang2022Structure).

UNC79 is organized into five functional domains: the N-terminal UNC-heterodimerization domain (UHD-N), UNC connecting domain 1 (UCD1), middle UNC-heterodimerization domain (UHD-M), UNC connecting domain 2 (UCD2), and C-terminal UNC-heterodimerization domain (UHD-C). These domains facilitate interactions with UNC80 in a head-to-tail fashion, forming a plier-shaped complex similar to the infinity symbol (Kang2022Structure).

The quaternary structure of UNC79 involves its assembly with UNC80 into a super-helical, S-shaped structure, which is distinct from predicted models. This assembly is characterized by extensive interactions across three interfaces: the N-interface, M-interface, and C-interface, with a total interface area of about 5000 Å² (Zhou2022Architecture). These structural features are essential for the proper function and regulation of the NALCN channelosome.

## Function
The UNC79 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the NALCN channel complex, which plays a significant role in regulating sodium ion flow across cell membranes. This complex is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability in healthy human cells (Kang2022Structure; Zhou2022Architecture). UNC79, along with UNC80, forms a super-helical structure that is crucial for the assembly and function of the NALCN channelosome. This structure facilitates the interaction with the NALCN-FAM155A subcomplex, which is necessary for the proper function of the channel (Kang2022Structure; Zhou2022Architecture).

UNC79 is primarily active in the nervous system, where it contributes to processes such as motor function, pain sensitivity, and circadian rhythm regulation (Zhou2022Architecture). The protein indirectly associates with NALCN through its interaction with UNC80, forming a complex that is essential for the channel's response to extracellular calcium levels, which is crucial for neuronal excitability (Lu2010Extracellular). Disruptions in the interactions within this complex can lead to significant reductions in NALCN-mediated currents, affecting neuronal function and potentially leading to neurological disorders (Zhou2022Architecture).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UNC79 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. The UNC79 gene is part of the NALCN channel complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. Genetic studies have suggested a potential association between UNC79 and bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Specifically, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near the UNC79 gene, rs17125698, has been linked to BD, indicating a possible genetic susceptibility in this region (CochetBissuel2014The).

In the context of alcoholism, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a significant linkage of SNP rs12882384 within the UNC79 gene, suggesting its involvement in alcohol and nicotine comorbidity. Mice with mutations in the Unc-79 gene have shown increased ethanol consumption, supporting the gene's role in alcohol-related behaviors (CochetBissuel2014The).

While direct evidence of UNC79 mutations causing specific diseases is limited, these genetic associations highlight its potential involvement in complex neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which UNC79 influences these conditions and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
UNC79 is a critical component of the NALCN channel complex, which also includes UNC80, NALCN, and FAM155A. This complex is essential for regulating sodium ion flow in neurons. UNC79 interacts with UNC80 to form a stable heterodimer, which is crucial for the function and localization of the NALCN channel on the plasma membrane (Kang2022Structure). The interaction between UNC79 and UNC80 occurs through specific regions, including head, joint, and tail sites, with helices from each protein interacting at these sites (Kang2022Structure).

UNC79 does not directly interact with NALCN; instead, it associates with NALCN indirectly through its interaction with UNC80. This interaction was demonstrated in immunoprecipitation experiments, where co-transfection of tagged UNC79 and UNC80 showed that immunoprecipitating one protein also brought down the other, indicating their interaction (Lu2010Extracellular). The UNC79-UNC80 heterodimer binds to specific motifs on the NALCN channel, known as UNIM-A, UNIM-B, and UNIM-C, which are crucial for the channel's interaction with the heterodimer (Kang2022Structure).

The presence of UNC79 is necessary for the stability of UNC80 within the complex, as the absence of UNC79 leads to undetectable levels of UNC80, although NALCN remains present (Lu2010Extracellular). This indicates that UNC79 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the NALCN channel complex.
