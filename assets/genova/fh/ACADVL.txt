# ACADVL

## Overview
The ACADVL gene encodes the enzyme very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway responsible for the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids. VLCAD is categorized as an enzyme and plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism by catalyzing the initial step of fatty acid oxidation, thereby facilitating the conversion of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA for ATP production. This process is particularly vital in tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mutations in the ACADVL gene can lead to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), a metabolic disorder with varying clinical manifestations, including cardiomyopathy and hypoketotic hypoglycemia, depending on the severity and onset of the condition (Labella2023JuvenileOnset; Cox1998Chromosomal; D’Annibale2022Characterization).

## Structure
The ACADVL gene encodes the very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) enzyme, which is involved in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. The protein is structurally similar to other mammalian CoA-dehydrogenases and is composed of N-, M-, and C-domains. The M-domain, which is part of the VLCAD catalytic center, consists of two orthogonal beta-sheets (Shchelochkov2009Atypical). 

The primary structure of VLCAD consists of a sequence of amino acids, including specific mutations such as p.V283A, which is located near the protein's periphery and may affect protein stability (Miller2015Recurrent). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's catalytic function. The tertiary structure forms a globular protein, and the quaternary structure typically involves homodimerization, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Miller2015Recurrent).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in VLCAD, potentially affecting its activity and stability. The protein may also have different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can influence its function and the clinical presentation of VLCAD deficiency (Shchelochkov2009Atypical).

## Function
The ACADVL gene encodes the enzyme very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), which is integral to the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway of long-chain fatty acids. VLCAD catalyzes the initial step of this process by removing hydrogen atoms from the terminal two carbons of long-chain fatty acids, resulting in the production of FADH2. This reaction is crucial for converting fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the citric acid cycle to produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Cox1998Chromosomal; D’Annibale2022Characterization).

VLCAD is active in the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in energy production, particularly during periods of fasting or increased energy demand. This function is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in tissues with high energy requirements, such as the heart and muscles (D’Annibale2022Characterization). A deficiency in VLCAD activity can lead to metabolic disorders, characterized by symptoms such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia and cardiomyopathy, underscoring the enzyme's importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Cox1998Chromosomal; D’Annibale2022Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACADVL gene, which encodes the enzyme very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), lead to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), a metabolic disorder affecting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. VLCADD is an autosomal recessive condition with a spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from severe neonatal forms to milder, later-onset forms. The severe neonatal form is characterized by cardiomyopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and high mortality rates (Labella2023JuvenileOnset; Miller2015Recurrent). 

Infantile onset typically presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic dysfunction, while the later-onset form is associated with exercise-induced muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis (Labella2023JuvenileOnset; Miller2015Recurrent). Missense mutations or in-frame deletions in ACADVL are linked to milder forms of the disease, whereas null alleles often result in severe neonatal onset (Labella2023JuvenileOnset). 

Diagnosis is facilitated by newborn screening, which detects elevated levels of long-chain acylcarnitine conjugates, particularly C14:1 (Miller2015Recurrent). Management of VLCADD includes dietary modifications, such as a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet, to minimize muscle damage and slow disease progression (Labella2023JuvenileOnset).
