# SEMA5B

## Overview
SEMA5B is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 5B, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axon guidance and synapse regulation. Semaphorin 5B is a transmembrane protein characterized by a semaphorin domain, which is crucial for its function in synapse elimination and neuronal development (O’Connor2009Semaphorin; legg2003expression). The protein also contains thrombospondin type-1 repeats and a transmembrane region, contributing to its interactions with the extracellular matrix and other cellular components (legg2003expression). SEMA5B is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis, and has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma and neurodevelopmental disorders (Leong2015MethylCpG; Ding2022Prognostic). The gene's expression and regulation are critical for maintaining proper neuronal circuit development and function, highlighting its importance in both health and disease contexts.

## Structure
SEMA5B is a transmembrane protein characterized by a semaphorin domain of approximately 500 amino acids, which is crucial for its function in synapse elimination and axon guidance (O’Connor2009Semaphorin; legg2003expression). The protein also contains seven thrombospondin type-1 repeats, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail (legg2003expression). The semaphorin domain is typically involved in inhibitory signaling and is essential for the protein's role in synapse morphology regulation (O’Connor2009Semaphorin).

SEMA5B undergoes proteolytic processing, resulting in the release of an N-terminal fragment containing the semaphorin domain, which acts as a diffusible molecule (O’Connor2009Semaphorin). This processing is similar to that observed in other semaphorins, such as Sema4D (O’Connor2009Semaphorin). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 150 kDa in its full-length form, but it is also expressed in processed forms of 130 kDa and 80 kDa, indicating post-translational modifications (wood2006characterization; O’Connor2009Semaphorin).

The cytoplasmic tails of class 5 semaphorins, including SEMA5B, show significant divergence, which aids in distinguishing between different semaphorin proteins in studies (legg2003expression).

## Function
SEMA5B, a member of the semaphorin family, plays a crucial role in synapse elimination in hippocampal neurons. It is a transmembrane protein expressed in various regions of the developing brain, including the hippocampus, where it regulates synaptic connections. SEMA5B is involved in the active breakdown of synapses, as evidenced by experiments showing that its overexpression leads to a decrease in synaptic inputs, while knockdown results in an increase in synapse number and size (O’Connor2009Semaphorin).

The sema domain of SEMA5B is essential for its function in synapse elimination. This domain is biologically active and mediates effects such as growth cone collapse and synapse stability (O’Connor2009Semaphorin). SEMA5B is proteolytically processed, releasing fragments that include the sema domain, which is necessary for its function in synapse regulation (O’Connor2009Semaphorin).

SEMA5B is secreted by hippocampal neurons to regulate presynaptic input, playing a significant role in synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory (O’Connor2009Semaphorin). Its interactions with the extracellular matrix, such as binding to heparin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, may regulate its function (O’Connor2009Semaphorin).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA5B has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma (KIRC), SEMA5B is significantly upregulated, correlating with clinical parameters such as age, gender, and tumor stage. High SEMA5B expression is associated with favorable prognosis and improved survival, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for KIRC (Ding2022Prognostic). The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and DNA mismatch repair, indicating its role in tumorigenesis and response to immunotherapy (Ding2022Prognostic).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, SEMA5B is involved in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. Its downregulation is associated with impaired neuronal differentiation and increased proliferation in neuroblastoma, particularly when the CHD7/SOX9 signaling pathway is activated (Lettieri2021Semaphorin). In Rett syndrome, SEMA5B expression is crucial for proper sensory neuron development, and its downregulation due to MECP2 mutations leads to sensory defects (Leong2015MethylCpG).

SEMA5B is also linked to autism spectrum disorders, with its expression affecting synapse density and sociability in animal models (dingwall2017characterization). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both cancer progression and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
SEMA5B, or semaphorin 5B, is involved in various interactions that influence neuronal development and synapse regulation. It undergoes proteolytic processing, releasing an N-terminal fragment containing the sema domain, which is crucial for its function in synapse elimination in hippocampal neurons (O’Connor2009Semaphorin). This fragment can act in both paracrine and autocrine manners, interacting with the extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as heparin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG). The binding affinity of SEMA5B to these ECM components is modulated by the sulfation level and location on the glycosaminoglycan side chain (O’Connor2009Semaphorin).

SEMA5B is also implicated in axon guidance and synaptogenesis through its interaction with the Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 regulates the transcription of SEMA5B, and its deficiency leads to downregulation of SEMA5B, affecting sensory neuron projections (Leong2015MethylCpG). In zebrafish, coexpression of SEMA5B and Robo2 can rescue defects in sensory neuron projections caused by MeCP2 deficiency, indicating a collaborative role in mediating MeCP2-dependent sensory responses (Leong2015MethylCpG). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SEMA5B in neuronal circuit development and maintenance.
