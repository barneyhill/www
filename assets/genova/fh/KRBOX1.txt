# KRBOX1

## Overview
KRBOX1 is a gene that encodes the protein KRAB box domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain. This domain is a transcriptional repression module frequently found in zinc finger proteins, which are known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (urrutia2003krab). The KRBOX1 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate gene expression, playing a significant role in gene silencing and chromatin remodeling (Nevalainen2017Intrauterine). It is prominently expressed in reproductive tissues, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology, although its specific functions in these tissues are not fully understood. The protein's involvement in transcriptional repression is mediated through its interaction with the corepressor KAP1, facilitating chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (urrutia2003krab). Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of KRBOX1's functions and its implications in various cellular processes.

## Function
KRBOX1 encodes a protein that contains a KRAB domain, which is a transcriptional repression module commonly found in zinc finger proteins. These proteins are typically involved in DNA binding and play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. The KRBOX1 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate gene expression. It is thought to be involved in gene silencing and chromatin remodeling, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation (Nevalainen2017Intrauterine).

The exact function of KRBOX1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, but it is prominently expressed in male testis and observed in female tissues such as the endometrium, fallopian tube, ovary, and placenta (Nevalainen2017Intrauterine). This suggests a potential role in reproductive biology, although its specific activities in these tissues remain to be further evaluated. The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling indicates it may have broader implications in cellular processes beyond reproduction, potentially affecting cell differentiation and proliferation. However, more research is needed to fully elucidate its functions in normal physiological conditions.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KRBOX1, a KRAB-associated zinc finger protein, is primarily involved in transcriptional repression. The KRAB domain of KRBOX1 interacts with the corepressor KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1), which is essential for mediating gene silencing. This interaction facilitates the formation of a complex with other proteins such as HP1, HDACs, and Setdb1, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (urrutia2003krab). The KRAB domain's role in transcriptional regulation is significant, as it binds to DNA through its C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, allowing KRBOX1 to potentially bind sequences of more than 60 nucleotides (urrutia2003krab).

In the context of human lung epithelial cells, KRBOX1 expression is significantly downregulated following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Gene 33 and chronic exposure to hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). This downregulation suggests a potential loss of KRBOX1 gene function, which may lead to the de-repression of upregulated genes, contributing to altered cellular phenotypes (Park2017Singlecell). Although KRBOX1 is believed to act as a transcription repressor, specific protein interactions beyond its association with KAP1 are not detailed in the available literature (Park2017Singlecell).
