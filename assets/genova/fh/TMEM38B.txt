# TMEM38B

## Overview
TMEM38B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 38B (TRIC-B), a trimeric intracellular cation channel predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of mammalian cells. As a transmembrane protein, TRIC-B plays a pivotal role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis by facilitating the movement of potassium ions, which are essential for the proper release of calcium from the ER. This function is critical for various cellular processes, including collagen synthesis and bone mineralization. Mutations in TMEM38B are linked to osteogenesis imperfecta type XIV, a genetic disorder characterized by bone fragility and deformities, underscoring the gene's importance in bone health and development (Cabral2016Absence; Leoni2021Knocking).

## Structure
The TMEM38B gene encodes the trimeric intracellular cation channel type B (TRIC-B), a protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of most mammalian tissues. TRIC-B is composed of 291 amino acids and features three transmembrane segments (TM1, TM2, and TM3) that span the lipid bilayer. These segments are crucial for ion conduction, channel gating, and correct protein folding (Lv2016Two). The protein forms a trimeric assembly, which is a characteristic feature of its quaternary structure, allowing it to function as a potassium (K+) channel synchronized with inositol trisphosphate-mediated calcium release (Lv2016Two).

The molecular structure of TRIC-B includes conserved proline residues and inclined transmembrane helices, which contribute to its function as a cation channel. The presence of lateral fenestrations at protomer interfaces, formed by glycine-mediated kinks in the transmembrane helices, is notable for lipid binding (Wang2019Structural). These structural features are essential for the protein's role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis, which is critical for collagen synthesis and bone health (Cabral2016Absence). The TRIC-B channel's structure is integral to its function, and mutations can lead to significant structural and functional changes, impacting bone integrity (Lv2016Two).

## Function
The TMEM38B gene encodes the TRIC-B protein, a trimeric intracellular cation channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This channel is specific for potassium ions and plays a crucial role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis by facilitating the passage of counter ions necessary for calcium release from the ER (Cabral2016Absence; Leoni2021Knocking). TRIC-B is involved in synchronizing with inositol 3 phosphate receptors (IP3Rs) to facilitate calcium release, which is essential for various cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis (Cabral2016Absence; Leoni2021Knocking).

In healthy human cells, TRIC-B ensures proper calcium flux kinetics, which is vital for normal collagen synthesis and bone matrix mineralization (Cabral2016Absence). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of calcium-dependent processes, such as the synthesis of type I collagen, by maintaining the potassium steady state when calcium release channels are not active (Cabral2016Absence). The absence of TRIC-B disrupts ER calcium homeostasis, leading to decreased cytoplasmic calcium levels and altered calcium transport processes, which can affect collagen synthesis and bone health (Cabral2016Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM38B gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type XIV, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone fragility and deformities. These mutations lead to the absence of the TRIC-B protein, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. The disruption of calcium flux within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in ER stress and dysregulation of type I collagen synthesis, contributing to the clinical manifestations of OI (Cabral2016Absence).

Patients with TMEM38B mutations exhibit a range of clinical features, including recurrent fractures, low bone mass, and mild bone deformities. The condition is marked by low trabecular bone volume and reduced bone resorption due to decreased osteoclast numbers, while bone matrix mineralization remains normal (Lv2016Two; Webb2017Phenotypic). The phenotypic spectrum can vary significantly, with some patients experiencing severe skeletal phenotypes and others being asymptomatic (Webb2017Phenotypic).

Research using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out TMEM38B in human fetal osteoblasts has shown impaired calcium flux and collagen I structure, mirroring patient cell findings. This highlights the gene's role in osteoblast functionality and its impact on bone health (Leoni2021Knocking).

## Interactions
TMEM38B, encoding the TRIC-B protein, is involved in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and interacts with several proteins crucial for calcium signaling and collagen synthesis. TRIC-B functions as a counter ion channel for monovalent cations, particularly potassium, following calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is associated with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), which is essential for calcium release from the ER, indicating a significant role in calcium signaling pathways (Tonelli2023Zebrafish).

The absence of TRIC-B affects the function of calcium-binding chaperones such as BiP, CyPB, PDI, and calreticulin, which are involved in the assembly and folding of collagen alpha chains. This disruption impacts the cycling of these chaperones between active and inactive forms, leading to abnormal collagen assembly and post-translational modification (Cabral2016Absence). TRIC-B deficiency also affects the expression and activity of collagen-modifying enzymes like lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1), despite increased PLOD1 transcripts and LH1 protein levels, suggesting a complex interaction with these proteins (Cabral2016Absence).

These interactions highlight the critical role of TMEM38B in calcium homeostasis and its broader implications in bone cell function and matrix component synthesis, particularly in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type XIV (Cabral2016Absence).
