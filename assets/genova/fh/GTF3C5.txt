# GTF3C5

## Overview
GTF3C5 is a gene that encodes the protein general transcription factor IIIC subunit 5, which is a critical component of the TFIIIC complex. This complex is integral to the transcriptional regulation of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, including those encoding tRNA and other small RNAs. The protein encoded by GTF3C5 is involved in chromatin remodeling processes, such as chromatin looping and histone acetylation, which are essential for gene expression regulation. It also interacts with other proteins, such as DNMT3L, suggesting a role in DNA methylation and broader epigenetic regulation mechanisms. The TFIIIC complex, including GTF3C5, is known for its histone acetyltransferase activity, contributing to the acetylation of histone H3, a modification associated with active transcription. GTF3C5's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining basal transcription levels and responding to external stimuli, thereby playing a significant role in cellular function and gene expression regulation (Ferrari2018TFIIIC; Pacaud2014DNMT3L).

## Structure


## Function
GTF3C5 is a component of the TFIIIC complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin looping and histone acetylation. This complex is involved in the transcription of genes by RNA polymerase III, particularly those encoding tRNA and other small RNAs. GTF3C5, as part of the TFIIIC complex, is implicated in forming chromatin loops that facilitate interactions between Alu elements and gene promoters, thereby influencing gene expression (Ferrari2018TFIIIC).

The TFIIIC complex, including GTF3C5, is active in the nucleus, where it helps recruit and stabilize other transcription factors, facilitating the assembly of the transcription machinery. This activity is essential for maintaining basal transcription levels and is particularly responsive to external stimuli such as serum (Ferrari2018TFIIIC). GTF3C5 is also involved in the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 18 (H3K18), a modification associated with increased chromatin accessibility, which is crucial for gene expression regulation (Ferrari2018TFIIIC).

Additionally, GTF3C5 has been identified as interacting with DNMT3L, a protein involved in DNA methylation, suggesting a role in targeting DNA methylation processes (Pacaud2014DNMT3L). This interaction highlights its potential involvement in broader epigenetic regulation mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The GTF3C5 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, alterations in expression levels, and changes in its normal interactions. In the context of endometriosis, GTF3C5 is noted for its differential expression between endometrioid and non-endometrioid endometrial cancer, suggesting a role in cancer pathophysiology (Akter2019Machine). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coding mutations in GTF3C5 are associated with the disease, highlighting its potential role in early categorization and treatment of patients (Zeneyedpour2019Neoantigens).

In liver cancer, the downregulation of GTF3C5 is associated with poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wu2020Low). The gene is also involved in the regulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in pancreatic islets, where its expression is downregulated in islets undergoing apoptosis, suggesting a role in beta-cell survival and function (Hossain2023Exploring). Additionally, GTF3C5 is mentioned in the context of myeloproliferative neoplasms, although no significant expression differences were observed in the study (van2021Characterization). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GTF3C5 in various diseases, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
GTF3C5, a subunit of the TFIIIC complex, plays a significant role in chromatin interactions and gene expression regulation. It is involved in the binding of TFIIIC to Alu elements, which are repetitive sequences in the genome, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression through histone acetylation and chromatin looping (Ferrari2018TFIIIC). The TFIIIC complex, including GTF3C5, interacts with CTCF, a protein enriched at promoter regions, to facilitate chromatin looping. This interaction is enhanced under conditions such as serum starvation, indicating a dynamic role in chromatin architecture and gene regulation (Ferrari2018TFIIIC).

The TFIIIC complex itself possesses histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, contributing to the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 18 (H3K18ac), a modification associated with active transcription (Ferrari2018TFIIIC). GTF3C5's role in maintaining the acetylation state and chromatin accessibility at TFIIIC-bound Alu elements underscores its importance in transcriptional regulation (Ferrari2018TFIIIC). Despite its critical functions, specific details about the direct physical interactions of GTF3C5 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented in the available context (Purrello2001Genes).
