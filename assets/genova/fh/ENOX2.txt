# ENOX2

## Overview
ENOX2 is a gene that encodes the protein ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 2, which is a member of the ENOX family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in cell surface redox activities, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and signaling. ENOX2 is a tumor-associated NADH oxidase that is active on the cell surface, facilitating electron transfer across the plasma membrane, which is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and supporting metabolic processes. This protein is particularly significant in tissues with rapid cell turnover and growth, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, making it a potential biomarker for early cancer detection (Morré2016ENOX2based; Hostetler2008Cancer).

## Function
ENOX2, also known as ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 2, is a member of the ENOX family of proteins that are involved in cell surface redox activities. These proteins play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation by catalyzing the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of protein disulfides. ENOX2 is active on the cell surface, where it participates in essential cellular processes such as cell signaling. The protein's activity is linked to its ability to facilitate electron transfer across the plasma membrane, which is vital for maintaining cellular redox balance and supporting various metabolic processes. ENOX2's function in healthy human cells includes its involvement in the modulation of cell cycle progression and its potential role in the regulation of apoptosis. By influencing these processes, ENOX2 contributes to the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and function. Its activity is particularly significant in tissues where rapid cell turnover and growth are required, highlighting its importance in organismal development and tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
The ENOX2 gene is clinically significant due to its association with various cancers. ENOX2 encodes a family of tumor-associated cell surface ubiquinone (NADH) oxidase proteins, which are specific to cancer cells and absent in non-cancerous cells. These proteins are involved in the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells and are constitutively activated, unlike their ENOX1 counterparts (Hostetler2008Cancer). ENOX2 expression is linked to several cancers, with specific isoforms identified for different types, such as cervical, ovarian, prostate, breast, lung, pancreatic, colon cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and malignant melanoma (Hostetler2008Cancer).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), ENOX2 is overexpressed in BCR-ABL1-positive leukemias, with its expression dependent on the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein's tyrosine kinase activity. This overexpression is characteristic of the chronic phase of CML and is significantly higher than in the accelerated and blast phases (BaykalKöse2021ENOX2; Baykal2023ENOX2). ENOX2 is also implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where high expression correlates with poor prognosis (Lin2019Engagement).

ENOX2 proteins serve as potential biomarkers for early cancer detection, as they are shed into the serum from cancer cells, allowing for non-invasive diagnostic testing (Morré2016ENOX2based).

## Interactions
ENOX2, also known as tNOX, is involved in various interactions that influence cancer cell metabolism and apoptosis. It is a tumor-associated NADH oxidase expressed on the cell surface and is implicated in the regulation of electron transport and cell signaling. ENOX2 interacts with phenoxodiol, a compound that inhibits its activity, leading to increased cytosolic NADH levels and subsequent alterations in sphingolipid metabolism. This interaction results in the accumulation of ceramide and reduction of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), promoting apoptosis through the inhibition of the Akt pathway (De2010Reciprocal; De2008Downstream).

Capsaicin, a component of red chili peppers, directly binds to ENOX2, stabilizing the protein and promoting its proteasomal degradation. This interaction decreases the NAD+/NADH ratio and suppresses SIRT1 deacetylase activity, leading to increased acetylation of c-Myc and p53, which affects cell cycle regulation and induces cell cycle arrest (Islam2019Capsaicin).

In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, ENOX2 interacts with novel compounds such as 4,11-diaminoanthra[2,3-b]furan-5,10-diones, which inhibit SIRT1 and activate apoptotic pathways. These interactions lead to enhanced acetylation of p53 in p53 wild-type cells and c-Myc in p53-deficient cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis (Lin2019Engagement).
