# SFN

## Overview
The SFN gene encodes the protein stratifin, also known as 14-3-3 sigma, which is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. Stratifin is a regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle control and genomic stability by acting as a cell cycle checkpoint protein, particularly in response to DNA damage. It functions by binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins, thereby influencing their activity, localization, and stability. This interaction is vital for regulating mitotic translation and preventing DNA errors during mitosis (Hu2019Expression). Stratifin is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box) complex and interactions with proteins such as ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) and CALML5, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and cancer progression (Sun2015CALML5; ShibaIshii2019Stratifin; Kim2018Stratifin).

## Structure


## Function
Stratifin (SFN), also known as 14-3-3 sigma, is a protein that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, SFN functions as a cell cycle checkpoint protein, particularly in response to DNA damage. It binds to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins, influencing their activity, localization, and stability. This binding is crucial for regulating mitotic translation and preventing DNA errors during mitosis (Hu2019Expression).

SFN is involved in the regulation of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box) complex by interacting with SKP1, an adaptor protein. This interaction inhibits the formation of the SCF FBW7 complex, which is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of several phosphorylated oncoproteins. By blocking this complex, SFN affects the stability and localization of SKP1, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear translocation (ShibaIshii2019Stratifin).

SFN is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting processes like cell division and stress response. Its role in regulating protein stability and localization suggests it may influence various E3 ubiquitin ligases, affecting cell cycle and growth processes (ShibaIshii2019Stratifin).

## Clinical Significance
The SFN gene, also known as stratifin or 14-3-3 sigma, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In ovarian cancer, particularly Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma, SFN is altered in approximately 7.76% of cases. High expression levels of SFN are associated with poor overall survival in patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy with drugs like Gemcitabine, Taxol, and Paclitaxel (Hu2019Expression).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SFN is overexpressed in early invasive adenocarcinomas compared to adenocarcinoma in situ, suggesting its role in cancer progression. This overexpression is linked to DNA demethylation in the SFN promoter region, contributing to tumor growth by inhibiting the degradation of oncoproteins such as cyclin E1 and c-Jun (Shiba‐Ishii2021Significance; ShibaIshii2015Stratifin). SFN also interacts with ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), stabilizing receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and MET, which are crucial for tumor proliferation (Kim2018Stratifin).

In breast cancer, SFN is typically downregulated due to hypermethylation, which is observed in over 90% of invasive cases. This downregulation is considered an early event in breast cancer development and is associated with a lack of expression in BRCA1- and BRCA2-related tumors (Lewis2005Mutation).

## Interactions
Stratifin (SFN) is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family and is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma cells, SFN interacts with ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), a relationship that is crucial for the stabilization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR and MET. This interaction prevents the dephosphorylation of USP8 by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), enhancing RTK stabilization and promoting cancer cell proliferation (Kim2018Stratifin). SFN also regulates USP8's autodeubiquitination activity, stabilizing the protein and facilitating its function in RTK recycling (Kim2018Stratifin).

In cervical cancer, SFN interacts with the LIMK2/Cofilin signaling pathway, promoting cytoskeletal remodeling and enhancing cell proliferation and metastasis (Du2023Stratifin). SFN's interaction with the SCF FBW7 complex in lung adenocarcinoma inhibits the degradation of oncoproteins like cyclin E1, contributing to tumor progression (ShibaIshii2019Stratifin). SFN also interacts with CALML5 in keratinocytes, promoting epidermal differentiation by influencing the expression of CALML5 target genes (Sun2015CALML5). These interactions highlight SFN's role in various cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
