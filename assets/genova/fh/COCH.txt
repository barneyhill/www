# COCH

## Overview
The COCH gene encodes cochlin, a secreted protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional integrity of the inner ear. Cochlin is primarily expressed in the cochlea and vestibular system, where it is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is characterized by its unique structural domains, including the LCCL domain and von Willebrand factor A-like domains, which facilitate its interactions with various ECM components and contribute to its role in hearing and balance (Kommareddi2007Cochlin; Picciani2007Cochlin). Mutations in the COCH gene are linked to DFNA9, an autosomal dominant form of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, and other auditory disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Robijn2022GenotypePhenotype; Robertson1998Mutations).

## Structure
Cochlin, encoded by the COCH gene, is a protein primarily expressed in the inner ear and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It contains several distinct domains, including a signal peptide, an LCCL (Limulus factor C, cochlin, late gestation lung protein) domain, and two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) homology domains, separated by intervening domains (Kommareddi2007Cochlin). The LCCL domain has a unique fold with a central alpha-helix wrapped by two beta-sheets, resembling a 'hot-dog' structure, and is stabilized by disulfide bonds (Liepinsh2001NMR). This domain is implicated in the DFNA9 deafness disorder, with several mutations affecting its folding and stability (Liepinsh2001NMR).

Cochlin is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation (Kommareddi2007Cochlin). Eight isoforms have been identified, varying in exon composition and molecular mass, ranging from 4 kDa to 59 kDa (Kommareddi2007Cochlin). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in smaller forms, such as a ∼50 kDa isoform derived from the C-terminal portion (Robertson2003Subcellular). These structural features and modifications contribute to cochlin's functional diversity and its role in the inner ear.

## Function
The COCH gene encodes cochlin, a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the inner ear, particularly in the cochlea and vestibular system. Cochlin is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the inner ear, where it contributes to hearing and balance by ensuring the proper organization and stability of ECM structures (Picciani2007Cochlin). It contains von Willebrand factor A-like domains, which are involved in binding extracellular tissue components such as fibrillar collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, thereby maintaining the structural framework of the ear (Robertson2014Cochlin).

Cochlin is also involved in mechanosensation and modulation of cellular adhesion, responding to mechanical stimuli such as shear stress, which is relevant for its function in both the inner ear and the eye (Picciani2007Cochlin). The protein undergoes multimerization in response to changes in ion concentration and oxidative conditions, a process that may be important for its role in mechanosensory systems (Picciani2007Cochlin). In healthy cells, cochlin is localized in specific structures of the middle ear, such as the incudomalleal and incudostapedial joints, and the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of these areas (Robertson2014Cochlin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COCH gene, which encodes the protein cochlin, are primarily associated with DFNA9, an autosomal dominant form of progressive sensorineural hearing loss often accompanied by vestibular dysfunction. DFNA9 is characterized by high-frequency hearing loss that typically begins between the ages of 20 and 30 and can progress to complete hearing loss by the age of 40 to 50. Vestibular symptoms, such as vertigo and balance issues, vary among individuals (Robijn2022GenotypePhenotype; Robertson1998Mutations).

Specific missense mutations in the COCH gene, such as V66G, G88E, and W117R, have been identified in families with DFNA9. These mutations are located in the N-terminal region of the COCH protein, which is homologous to a domain in Limulus factor C and contains conserved cysteine residues (Robertson1998Mutations). The COCH gene is also linked to Menière's disease-like symptoms, including vertigo, tinnitus, and aural fullness, as observed in certain families with COCH mutations (Fransen1999High).

In addition to DFNA9, homozygous loss of function mutations in COCH can lead to DFNB110, an autosomal recessive, early-onset, and severe form of hearing loss (Robijn2022GenotypePhenotype).

## Interactions
Cochlin, encoded by the COCH gene, is known to interact with several proteins, particularly within the inner ear. One significant interaction is with CTL2 (SLC44A2), a membrane protein. Studies have shown that cochlin co-immunoprecipitates with CTL2, indicating a physical interaction between these proteins. This interaction suggests that cochlin and CTL2 may form a functional complex essential for the structural or functional integrity of inner ear sensory cells (Kommareddi2007Cochlin).

Cochlin is also involved in interactions with components of the extracellular matrix. The von Willebrand factor A-like (vWFA) domains of cochlin are known to bind fibrillar collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, suggesting that cochlin plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (Bae2014Identification). Mutations in these domains can lead to misfolding and aggregation, potentially disrupting these interactions and contributing to disorders such as DFNA9 (Bae2014Identification).

The LCCL domain of cochlin is implicated in protein-protein interactions, although specific binding partners have yet to be identified. This domain may have adhesive properties or roles in the extracellular matrix, which are disrupted by mutations associated with DFNA9 (Liepinsh2001NMR).
