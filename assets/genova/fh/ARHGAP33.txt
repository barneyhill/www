# ARHGAP33

## Overview
ARHGAP33 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 33, also known as NOMA-GAP. This protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly in the nervous system. It is involved in the transport and localization of the TrkB receptor, which is essential for synaptic signaling and neuronal development (Nakazawa2016Emerging). ARHGAP33 is predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in regions such as the cortex and hippocampus, where it influences dendritic spine morphology and synaptic transmission (Nakazawa2016Emerging). The protein interacts with several other proteins, including members of the MAGUK family, to maintain synaptic structure and function, thereby impacting cognitive processes such as learning and memory (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33). Alterations in ARHGAP33 expression or function have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cognitive and behavioral functions (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33; Nakazawa2016Emerging).

## Function
ARHGAP33, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 33, plays a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly involving the TrkB receptor, which is essential for synaptic signaling and neuronal development. In healthy cells, ARHGAP33 is involved in the transport of TrkB from the Golgi apparatus to synaptic sites, facilitating proper synaptic function and development (Nakazawa2016Emerging). It acts as a scaffolding protein, modulating the interaction between SORT1 and TrkB, which is vital for the trafficking of TrkB to the cell surface (Nakazawa2016Emerging).

ARHGAP33 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cortex and hippocampus, where it influences dendritic spine morphology and synaptic transmission (Nakazawa2016Emerging). It interacts with MAGUK proteins, such as PSD-95, affecting their localization and phosphorylation, which is crucial for synaptic signaling (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33). The protein's activity is significant for maintaining synaptic structure and function, impacting higher brain functions like learning and memory (Nakazawa2016Emerging). ARHGAP33's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cognitive and behavioral functions in healthy organisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ARHGAP33 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In schizophrenia, genetic variations in ARHGAP33, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs231228, have been associated with the disease. This SNP is linked to changes in grey matter volume in patients, suggesting a genetic association with schizophrenia (Nakazawa2016Emerging). The ARHGAP33 gene is also involved in the intracellular trafficking of TrkB, a receptor crucial for synaptic development. Dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, as ARHGAP33 knockout mice exhibit impaired synaptic development and behavioral abnormalities related to the disorder (Nakazawa2016Emerging).

In the context of ASDs, ARHGAP33, also known as NOMA-GAP, plays a role in synapse development and function. Deficiency in NOMA-GAP in mice leads to autism-like behaviors, such as impaired social recognition and increased anxiety, which are linked to synaptic transmission defects and altered dendritic spine morphology (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33). These findings suggest that ARHGAP33 is crucial for normal synaptic function and that its dysfunction may contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
ARHGAP33, also known as NOMA-GAP, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and synapse development. It primarily localizes at the Golgi apparatus and interacts with SORT1, a protein that regulates the sorting of the TrkB receptor at the Golgi. This interaction is essential for the proper trafficking of TrkB to the cell surface, as ARHGAP33 does not directly interact with TrkB without SORT1 (Nakazawa2016Emerging). ARHGAP33 acts as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the interaction between SORT1 and TrkB (Nakazawa2016Emerging).

In the context of synapse development, ARHGAP33 interacts with PSD-95, a member of the MAGUK family of proteins. This interaction is mediated by a serine-proline-rich region in ARHGAP33 and the C-terminal SH3-guanylate kinase region of PSD-95. ARHGAP33 influences the subcellular localization of PSD-95, affecting its translocation to the plasma membrane and its phosphorylation state, which is crucial for synaptic localization (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33). ARHGAP33 also interacts with other MAGUK family proteins, such as DLG2/PSD-93 and DLG3/SAP102, but not with DLG1/SAP97 (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33). These interactions highlight ARHGAP33's role as a multiadaptor signaling molecule in postmitotic neurons (Schuster2015NOMAGAPARHGAP33).
