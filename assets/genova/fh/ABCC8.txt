# ABCC8

## Overview
The ABCC8 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), a critical component of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically subfamily C. This gene plays a pivotal role in the regulation of insulin secretion through its involvement in the ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channel complex. The SUR1 protein, characterized as a transmembrane regulatory subunit, interacts with the Kir6.2 subunits to form a hetero-octameric channel that links cellular metabolic states to insulin release. The channel's activity is modulated by intracellular ATP and ADP levels, which influence the gating of the Kir6.2 subunits, thereby controlling insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (Bryan2006ABCC8; Tinker2018ATP‐Sensitive). Mutations in ABCC8 can lead to disorders such as congenital hyperinsulinism and neonatal diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance in glucose homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Babenko2008A; Saint‐Martin2021Functional).

## Structure
The ABCC8 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family. SUR1 is characterized by having three transmembrane domains (TMDs) composed of five, six, and six transmembrane segments, respectively (Tinker2018ATP‐Sensitive). It also contains two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) with Walker A and B motifs, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Burke2008The). These NBDs are crucial for the protein's function in regulating the K_ATP channel (Tinker2018ATP‐Sensitive).

The quaternary structure of SUR1 involves its assembly with Kir6.0 subunits to form a hetero-octameric K_ATP channel complex, with a 4:4 stoichiometry of Kir to SUR subunits (LópezAlonso2012NMR). The TMD0 and linker L0 regions of SUR1 are involved in the interaction with Kir6.2 subunits, influencing channel gating and function (Burke2008The). 

SUR1 is subject to alternative splicing, although the significance of these variants is not clearly established (Tinker2018ATP‐Sensitive). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which may affect the protein's regulatory functions (Sarkadi2006Human).

## Function
The ABCC8 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channel, which is crucial for insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. This channel is a heterooctamer composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four SUR1 subunits, forming a 4:4 stoichiometry (Bryan2006ABCC8; UEDA2011ABC). The primary function of SUR1 is to act as a regulatory switch that controls the opening and closing of the Kir6.2 channel subunits in response to the intracellular metabolic state, particularly the levels of ATP and ADP (Bryan2006ABCC8; UEDA2011ABC).

In healthy cells, the K_ATP channel links glucose metabolism to insulin release. When glucose levels rise, ATP binds to the Kir6.2 subunit, reducing channel activity and leading to cell depolarization, which triggers insulin secretion. Conversely, Mg-nucleotide binding to SUR1 promotes channel opening, counteracting ATP's effect and allowing the cell to respond to changes in energy status (Bryan2006ABCC8). This regulation is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and proper blood glucose levels (Bryan2006ABCC8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCC8 gene, which encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channel, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) and neonatal diabetes. CHI is characterized by excessive insulin secretion, leading to persistent hypoglycemia. This condition can manifest in both diffuse and focal forms, with the diffuse form often being diazoxide-unresponsive and linked to both recessive and dominant mutations in ABCC8 (BellanneChantelot2010ABCC8; Saint‐Martin2021Functional). The severity of CHI symptoms can vary depending on the relative expression levels of mutant versus normal alleles, as seen in cases where individuals with higher expression of the mutant allele exhibit more severe symptoms (Shemer2011Relative).

In addition to CHI, activating mutations in ABCC8 can lead to neonatal diabetes, which may present with a range of phenotypes from transient or permanent diabetes to more complex syndromes like DEND (developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes) (Klee2012A). The phenotypic variability associated with ABCC8 mutations underscores the gene's significant role in insulin regulation and its impact on metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
The ABCC8 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), a regulatory subunit of ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channels. These channels are composed of SUR1 and the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2, encoded by the KCNJ11 gene. The interaction between SUR1 and Kir6.2 is crucial for the formation and function of K_ATP channels, which play a significant role in insulin secretion and neuronal activity (Weedon2016From; Bryan2006ABCC8).

SUR1 interacts with nucleotides such as ATP and ADP, which regulate the channel's activity by modulating its open probability. The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of SUR1 are involved in these interactions, with ATP binding and hydrolysis driving conformational changes that affect channel gating (Bryan2006ABCC8).

Mutations in the ABCC8 gene can alter these interactions, leading to conditions such as hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and neonatal diabetes. These mutations may affect the channel's response to metabolic changes by stabilizing certain nucleotide-bound states, thereby influencing cellular excitability (Babenko2011The; Babenko2008A).

SUR1 also interacts with pharmacological agents like sulfonylureas and diazoxide, which can inhibit or activate the K_ATP channel, respectively. These interactions involve specific binding sites on the SUR1 subunit, contributing to the regulation of channel activity (Bryan2006ABCC8).
