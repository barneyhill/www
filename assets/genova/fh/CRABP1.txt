# CRABP1

## Overview
CRABP1 (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a small, highly conserved intracellular protein involved in the regulation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. The protein, also named CRABP1, belongs to the family of lipid-binding proteins and is characterized by its ability to bind all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) with high affinity. This binding modulates the availability of RA within the cell, thereby influencing the expression of RA-responsive genes and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Nagpal2019Alltrans; Nhieu2022CRABP1). CRABP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, by interacting with key signaling pathways such as the MAPK and CaMKII pathways (Nhieu2023Molecular; Nhieu2022CRABP1). Its involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic conditions (Nhieu2022CRABP1; Liu2015CRABP1).

## Structure
CRABP1 (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1) is a highly conserved protein characterized by its anti-parallel beta-barrel tertiary structure, which forms the ligand-binding pocket. This beta-barrel consists of 10 beta-strands and is linked to a helix-turn-helix motif (Nhieu2023Molecular). The primary structure of CRABP1 is highly conserved, with the only non-conserved residue being proline 86, which is an alanine in human and bovine orthologs (Nhieu2023Molecular). The secondary structure includes a helix-turn-helix motif and a beta-sheet face, with specific residues such as His94, Thr96, Tyr108, and Thr110 playing a role in its interaction with CaMKII (Nhieu2023Molecular).

CRABP1 functions as a monomer and does not typically form quaternary structures. It has a hydrophobic pocket within its tertiary structure that binds retinoic acid (Nhieu2023Molecular). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. CRABP1's structure is crucial for its role in modulating signaling pathways, and mutations in specific residues can alter its function (Nhieu2023Molecular).

## Function
Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (CRABP1) is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in modulating cellular retinoic acid (RA) activities. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it binds all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) with high affinity, sequestering it from the cytosolic environment and controlling its availability in the cell (Nagpal2019Alltrans; Nhieu2022CRABP1). This regulation affects the expression of RA-responsive genes and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

CRABP1 is involved in non-canonical activities of RA, influencing various signaling pathways. It interacts with calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in excitable cells like cardiomyocytes and neurons, dampening its activation and protecting against overactivation-related pathologies (Nhieu2023Molecular; Nhieu2022CRABP1). CRABP1 also competes with Ras for interaction with Raf kinase in the MAPK signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator to dampen ERK activation, which is important for cell proliferation and differentiation (Nagpal2019Alltrans; Nhieu2022CRABP1).

In adipocytes, CRABP1 negatively regulates ERK activity, inhibiting adipogenesis and protecting against obesity and insulin resistance (Nhieu2022CRABP1). In neural stem cells, CRABP1 modulates proliferation, affecting learning and memory (Nagpal2019Alltrans). These functions underscore CRABP1's importance in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
CRABP1 has been implicated in various human diseases through alterations in its expression levels and mutations. In cancer, CRABP1 expression is often dysregulated, with reduced expression observed in colorectal, thyroid, ovarian, esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, often due to promoter hypermethylation (Nhieu2022CRABP1). In breast cancer, CRABP1 is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative and triple-negative subtypes. It sequesters retinoic acid in the cytoplasm, inhibiting its nuclear action and contributing to RA resistance (Liu2015CRABP1). CRABP1 is also linked to the aggressiveness of mesenchymal and neuroendocrine tumors, such as synovial sarcomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, where its expression is associated with increased metastatic potential (Kainov2014CRABP1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, CRABP1 expression is reduced in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where it is significantly suppressed in motor neurons, suggesting a role in disease progression (Nhieu2022CRABP1). CRABP1 is also involved in metabolic disorders, with its absence linked to increased susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance (Nhieu2022CRABP1).

## Interactions
CRABP1 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms complexes with components of the MAPK signaling pathway, including Raf, Mek, and Erk kinases. CRABP1 competes with Ras for binding to the Ras-binding domain of Raf, thereby modulating the Raf-Erk signaling pathway. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), which binds to CRABP1 and facilitates its role as a scaffold or allosteric regulator in the MAPK pathway (Park2019A).

CRABP1 also interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and exosome secretion. It forms complexes with proteins such as ACTR3, ACTR2, ARPC3, and ARPC4, suggesting a role in modulating exosome secretion through actin nucleation and endosome maturation (Nhieu2024CRABP1complexes).

Additionally, CRABP1 interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP26A1, affecting the metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid. These interactions influence the kinetic parameters of atRA metabolism, indicating that CRABP1 can modulate the activity of these enzymes through protein-protein interactions (Yabut2022CRABPs).
