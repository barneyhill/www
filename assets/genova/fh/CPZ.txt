# CPZ

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) is a gene that encodes a metallocarboxypeptidase enzyme involved in the processing of proteins by cleaving C-terminal amino acids. The protein, also named carboxypeptidase Z, is characterized by its metallocarboxypeptidase domain and a cysteine-rich Frizzled-like (Fz) domain, which facilitates its role in the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of embryonic development and cell differentiation (GarciaPardo2020Substrate; Song1997Cloning). CPZ is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it functions as an extracellular Wnt-binding protein, influencing developmental processes by modulating gene expression through Wnt signaling (Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases). The gene is located on chromosome 4p16 and has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including neuroblastoma, due to its involvement in Wnt signaling pathways (McDaniel2017Common).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) is a metallocarboxypeptidase enzyme characterized by a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of CPZ includes a sequence of 641 amino acids in humans, featuring a metallocarboxypeptidase domain and a cysteine-rich Frizzled-like (Fz) domain (GarciaPardo2020Substrate; Song1997Cloning). The Fz domain is involved in Wnt protein binding, which plays a role in signaling pathways (GarciaPardo2020Substrate).

The secondary structure of CPZ includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, particularly within the Fz domain, which consists of four α-helices stabilized by disulfide bonds and two short β-strands forming a minimal β-sheet (GarciaPardo2020Substrate). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, with the Fz domain potentially interacting with the catalytic domain (GarciaPardo2020Substrate).

CPZ is synthesized as a constitutively active enzyme and is secreted into the extracellular matrix, where it can bind to heparin (GarciaPardo2020Substrate). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are suggested by the presence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (XIN1998Cloning). CPZ also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may lack certain domains, such as the Fz domain (Song1997Cloning).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) is a metallocarboxypeptidase involved in the processing of proteins by cleaving C-terminal amino acids. It plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating embryonic development and cell differentiation. CPZ contains an N-terminal Frizzled domain, suggesting it binds to Wnt proteins, potentially inhibiting their interaction with Frizzled receptors, thereby modulating Wnt signaling pathways (Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases).

CPZ is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it functions as an extracellular Wnt-binding protein rather than a receptor. This localization supports its role in influencing developmental processes by regulating gene expression through Wnt signaling (Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases). The enzyme exhibits a pH optimum of 7-8 and is inhibited by chelating agents, indicating its role as a metallocarboxypeptidase (Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases).

In adult tissues, CPZ expression is significantly reduced but remains notable in the placenta and specific skin cells. Its expression pattern overlaps with several Wnt genes, reinforcing its involvement in Wnt signaling pathways during development (Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases).

## Clinical Significance
The CPZ gene, located at chromosome 4p16, encodes a member of the carboxypeptidase E subfamily of metallocarboxypeptidases, which are Zn-dependent enzymes involved in protein processing. Variants in the CPZ gene locus have been associated with neuroblastoma, a common cancer in infants. Specifically, the rs3796727 risk allele correlates with decreased methylation in the 5' UTR of CPZ, suggesting increased expression of CPZ. CPZ is enriched in the extracellular matrix and expressed during early embryogenesis, and it has been implicated in WNT signaling, which is crucial for cell differentiation and development. Although a direct genotype-expression correlation in neuroblastoma cell lines was not observed, CPZ may influence tumor initiation, particularly in precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system. The study suggests that CPZ's role in neuroblastoma may be linked to its involvement in WNT signaling pathways, which are known to be critical in various developmental processes and diseases (McDaniel2017Common).

In chickens, CPZ has been shown to modulate Wnt signaling, particularly affecting skeletal development. Ectopic expression of CPZ can lead to dysmorphogenesis of skeletal structures, indicating its significant role in developmental processes (Moeller2003Carboxypeptidase). However, the excerpt does not directly mention any diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in CPZ expression or interactions in humans (Moeller2003Carboxypeptidase).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) is known to interact with Wnt proteins, which are crucial in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The N-terminal Frizzled-like domain of CPZ is similar to those found in Frizzled proteins, which are receptors for Wnt proteins, suggesting that CPZ may bind Wnt proteins extracellularly (GarciaPardo2020Substrate; Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases). This interaction is supported by the structural modeling of CPZ, which indicates that its Frizzled-like domain can interact with Wnt proteins, potentially affecting their recognition, stabilization, or degradation (GarciaPardo2020Substrate).

CPZ's expression pattern overlaps with several Wnt genes during mouse embryonic development, further supporting its role in interacting with Wnt proteins (Reznik2001Carboxypeptidases). The enzyme's ability to cleave C-terminal basic residues, such as Arg or Lys, from peptides suggests it may process Wnt signaling molecules, potentially acting as an effector in the Wnt signaling pathway (GarciaPardo2020Substrate). However, the exact biological functions and interactions of CPZ in the Wnt signaling pathway require further investigation (GarciaPardo2020Substrate).
