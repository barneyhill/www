# CAPN5

## Overview
The CAPN5 gene encodes calpain 5, a non-classical member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Unlike classical calpains, calpain 5 lacks the penta-EF hand domain and instead features a C-terminal C2 domain, which is crucial for its calcium binding and membrane localization (Bondada2021The). Calpain 5 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and retina, where it plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell death, movement, and intracellular signaling (Schaefer2016Calpain5). The protein is involved in the proteolytic processing of various substrates, contributing to synaptic function and signal transduction in the retina (Schaefer2016Calpain5). Mutations in the CAPN5 gene are linked to autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV), a progressive retinal disorder characterized by inflammation and neovascularization (Mahajan2012Calpain5). Additionally, calpain 5 has been implicated in the entry of the Hepatitis C virus into liver cells, highlighting its diverse functional roles (Bruening2018Hepatitis).

## Structure
The CAPN5 gene encodes the calpain-5 protein, a non-classical calpain that is distinct from classical calpains due to its unique structural features. Unlike classical calpains, CAPN5 lacks the penta-EF hand domain and instead contains a C-terminal C2 domain, which is involved in calcium binding and membrane localization (Bondada2021The). The C2 domain has a type II topology with loops capable of binding calcium, and mutations in acidic residues such as Asp531 and Asp589 affect its membrane association (Bondada2021The).

The protein structure of CAPN5 includes protease core domains (PC1 and PC2) that contain the catalytic Cys-His-Asn triad, although the catalytic triad is unformed in the inactive conformation (Velez2020Structural). The structure of CAPN5-PC has been determined, revealing three elongated loops compared to classical calpains, with one loop containing a mutation associated with retinal disease (Velez2020Structural). CAPN5 does not require a subunit or dimerization for activity, which is a notable difference from classical calpains (Bondada2021The).

CAPN5 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is linked to retinal diseases. It is a target for inhibitor design due to its high levels in the CNS (Wert2015CAPN5mutation; Velez2020Structural).

## Function
Calpain 5 (CAPN5) is a non-classical calpain that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system and retina. Unlike classical calpains, CAPN5 lacks the penta-EF hand domain and instead contains a C2 domain, which is crucial for its calcium-regulated enzyme activity and intracellular localization (Bondada2021The). CAPN5 is involved in proteolytically processing targets into new functional forms, contributing to processes such as cell death, movement, sex determination, and intracellular signaling (Schaefer2016Calpain5).

In the retina, CAPN5 is localized to photoreceptor synapses, outer segments, and the nucleus, suggesting a role in signal transmission and processing. Its high expression in the photoreceptor synaptic layer and mitochondria supports its involvement in synaptic function, including neurotransmitter release and signal transduction (Schaefer2016Calpain5). CAPN5 is also associated with mitochondrial and synaptic fractions, where it is hypothesized to facilitate calcium-dependent membrane binding, enhancing its enzymatic activity (Bondada2021The).

The C2 domain of CAPN5 is essential for its membrane localization and enzyme activation. Mutations in specific residues of the C2 domain can decrease membrane association and reduce autolytic activity, indicating the importance of this domain in CAPN5's function (Bondada2021The). CAPN5's proteolytic activity is crucial for normal synaptic function and intracellular signaling, with implications for understanding its involvement in retinal diseases (Schaefer2016Calpain5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAPN5 gene are associated with autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV), a progressive blinding disorder characterized by intraocular inflammation, retinal neovascularization, and photoreceptor degeneration. This condition progresses through stages that mimic other eye diseases such as uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, ultimately leading to complete blindness (Mahajan2012Calpain5; Velez2020Structural). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg243Leu and p.Leu244Pro, have been identified in exon 6 of the CAPN5 gene, affecting the protein's catalytic domain and leading to a gain of function that harms photoreceptor cells (Mahajan2012Calpain5).

The CAPN5 mutations result in hyperactivation of the calpain-5 protease by relieving the calcium requirement for activation, making the active site constantly available to substrates (Velez2020Structural). This hyperactivity is linked to severe intraocular inflammation and neovascularization, which are not typical of other monogenic photoreceptor diseases (Mahajan2012Calpain5). The R243L mutation, in particular, increases calpain catalytic activity, triggering intraocular inflammation and contributing to the ADNIV phenotype (Wert2015CAPN5mutation). Understanding these mutations provides insights into the mechanisms underlying common causes of blindness and may inform potential therapeutic approaches (Mahajan2012Calpain5).

## Interactions
CAPN5 (calpain 5) is involved in the entry of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) into liver cells through its interaction with the CD81 receptor complex. CAPN5 forms a complex with CD81 and the ubiquitin ligase CBLB, which is crucial for HCV entry. This interaction is necessary for a post-binding and pre-replication step in the HCV life cycle, but CAPN5's endopeptidase function is not required for this process, suggesting a scaffolding role instead (Bruening2018Hepatitis). 

The study by Bruening et al. highlights that CAPN5, along with CBLB, is specific to HCV entry and does not facilitate the entry of other pathogens like the malaria parasite Plasmodium, which uses different mechanisms for liver cell invasion (Bruening2018Hepatitis). CAPN5 does not affect the surface expression of other HCV entry receptors such as SCARB1, CD81, CLDN1, and OLCN, nor does it influence the entry of HCV glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses, indicating its role is not in the initial binding or fusion steps of viral entry (Bruening2018Hepatitis). 

While CAPN5 is associated with the CD81 receptor complex, specific details on its direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available excerpts (Bruening2018Hepatitis; Bondada2021The).
