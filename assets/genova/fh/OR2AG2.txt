# OR2AG2

## Overview
The OR2AG2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily AG member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Alonso2008Overdominance). While its primary function is associated with olfaction, OR2AG2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues such as the lungs and skin, where it may contribute to various physiological processes, including respiratory health and stress response (Tong2021Ectopic; Chakraborty2019Genetic). The gene's expression and potential mutations have been linked to clinical conditions such as asthma and preeclampsia, suggesting its broader significance beyond odor detection (Chakraborty2019Genetic; Hirata2023Exploring).

## Function
The OR2AG2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Alonso2008Overdominance). The molecular process involves the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to the generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and an influx of calcium ions (Ca2+), which ultimately causes neuron depolarization and signal transmission to the brain (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2AG2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including the lungs and skin, where it may play roles in various physiological processes. In the lungs, OR2AG2 expression is significantly lower in asthma patients, suggesting a potential involvement in respiratory health and asthma pathogenesis (Chakraborty2019Genetic). In the skin, OR2AG2 is implicated in the stress response, with phenylethyl alcohol acting as an agonist to protect against stress (Tong2021Ectopic). These findings indicate that OR2AG2 may have diverse functions beyond odor detection, contributing to broader physiological and pathological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OR2AG2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In asthma, a deleterious missense variant in OR2AG2 was identified in a multigenerational family, suggesting a potential role in asthma pathophysiology. This variant was associated with asthma in a broader cohort, indicating that OR2AG2 may influence asthma risk through mechanisms related to odor sensing and mucociliary clearance in the airways (Chakraborty2019Genetic). Additionally, OR2AG2 expression is significantly reduced in the lung tissues of asthma patients, which may be linked to the suppression of the gene during asthma pathogenesis (Chakraborty2019Genetic).

In the context of preeclampsia, OR2AG2 expression levels have been studied as potential biomarkers. Differential expression of OR2AG2, along with other olfactory receptors, was observed in early preeclampsia patients, suggesting its potential role in predicting the onset of this condition (Hirata2023Exploring). The study found that low expression of OR2AG2 was associated with an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, while overexpression appeared to be protective (Hirata2023Exploring). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and its utility as a diagnostic marker.
