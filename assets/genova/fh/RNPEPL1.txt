# RNPEPL1

## Overview
RNPEPL1 is a gene that encodes the protein arginyl aminopeptidase like 1, a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases. This protein is characterized by its broad substrate specificity and is involved in the degradation of peptides, contributing to cellular proteolysis and the recycling of amino acids. The enzyme exhibits a preference for methionine, glutamine, and citrulline residues, distinguishing it from other related aminopeptidases. RNPEPL1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its role as a housekeeping enzyme in peptide breakdown. The protein's activity is modulated by pH and is sensitive to specific inhibitors, which suggests its involvement in physiological processes such as peptide hormone regulation and antigen processing (Thompson2009Arginyl; Yuan2024Identification).

## Structure
The RNPEPL1 gene encodes a protein that is approximately 55 kDa in size, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Thompson2009Arginyl). The protein is a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases, characterized by the presence of conserved motifs such as the HEXXHX18E zinc-binding motif and the G/AMEN substrate-binding motif (Maynard2014Evolutionary). These motifs are critical for the enzyme's function, facilitating zinc binding and substrate interaction.

RNPEPL1 exhibits broad substrate specificity, with a preference for methionine, glutamine, and citrulline residues (Thompson2009Arginyl). The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed across tissues and undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. These isoforms include a full-length protein, a truncated version, and one lacking eleven conserved amino acids from the C-terminal domain (Thompson2009Arginyl). The alternative splicing events may affect the protein's function or localization, suggesting distinct roles for each isoform (Thompson2009Arginyl).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of RNPEPL1 are not provided, the presence of conserved motifs and alternative splicing indicates a complex structural and functional profile typical of M1 family members.

## Function
RNPEPL1 encodes an aminopeptidase that is part of the M1 metallopeptidase family, characterized by its broad substrate specificity. This enzyme primarily processes methionine, glutamine, and citrulline residues, although it can also act on alanine and leucine. Unlike its closely related counterpart RNPEP, RNPEPL1 does not efficiently process arginine or lysine, indicating distinct catalytic properties (Thompson2009Arginyl). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, suggesting a housekeeping role in peptide breakdown within the cytoplasm (Thompson2009Arginyl). 

RNPEPL1 is involved in the degradation of peptides and the recycling of amino acids, contributing to overall cellular proteolysis. It also plays a role in controlling physiological signaling sequences by breaking down peptide hormones and processing peptides displayed on class I MHC molecules (Yuan2024Identification). The enzyme's activity is influenced by pH, with optimal activity between pH 6.6 and 8.0, and it is sensitive to certain inhibitors like EDTA, amastatin, and bestatin (Thompson2009Arginyl). RNPEPL1's activity can be inhibited by high concentrations of calcium ions, although typical intracellular levels are unlikely to affect its function (Thompson2009Arginyl).
