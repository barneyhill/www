# KAT5

## Overview
KAT5, also known as TIP60, is a gene that encodes the lysine acetyltransferase 5 protein, a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability through its acetylation activity on both histone and non-histone proteins. The KAT5 protein is characterized by its chromodomain and catalytic MYST domain, which facilitate its function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Voss2018Histone; Jaiswal2022Lysine). KAT5 is integral to various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, by modulating the acetylation status of key substrates such as p53 and ATM (Jaiswal2022Lysine). Its involvement in these critical pathways underscores its significance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in cancer when dysregulated (Wei2019KAT5; Liu2021OGlcNAc).

## Function
KAT5, also known as TIP60, is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is characterized by a chromodomain and a catalytic MYST domain, which includes an acetyl-CoA binding motif, a zinc finger motif, and an NR Box motif (Jaiswal2022Lysine). KAT5 is involved in the acetylation of lysine residues on histones H2A, H3, and H4, which influences chromatin structure and gene expression by neutralizing the positive charge of lysine residues, thereby weakening the interaction between histones and DNA (Voss2018Histone). This acetylation serves as a docking site for chromatin-binding proteins, facilitating processes such as DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle progression (Voss2018Histone; Jaiswal2022Lysine).

KAT5 also acetylates non-histone substrates, including p53, ATM, c-Myc, STAT3, NF-kB, CREB, and E2F1, impacting various biological processes such as apoptosis and nuclear receptor signaling (Jaiswal2022Lysine). It acts as a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors, including androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors, and is essential for normal development, as evidenced by the fact that knockout mice embryos do not survive beyond the blastocyst stage (Jaiswal2022Lysine). KAT5 is active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Voss2018Histone).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KAT5 gene, also known as TIP60, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, low KAT5 mRNA expression is significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), particularly in the Luminal A subtype, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (McGuire2019Quantifying). In anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), KAT5 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion through the stabilization of the C-MYC protein (Wei2019KAT5). This overexpression is associated with increased metastasis and reduced survival in ATC patients (Wei2019KAT5).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KAT5 undergoes O-GlcNAcylation, enhancing its stability and promoting metastasis by activating TWIST1 expression and upregulating EMT-related markers (Liu2021OGlcNAc). The loss of KAT5 in various cancers can lead to genomic instability and tumor progression due to its role in the DNA damage response (Zohourian2024Evaluating). These findings highlight KAT5's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly in cases where its expression or function is dysregulated.

## Interactions
KAT5, also known as TIP60, is a lysine acetyltransferase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. KAT5 is a component of the TIP60 complex, a multifunctional assembly involved in chromatin recognition and DNA damage response. Within this complex, KAT5 interacts with subunits such as MBTD1 and EPC1, which are essential for its role in DNA repair and transcription regulation (Jacquet2016The). 

KAT5 also interacts with the transcription factor SOX4, acetylating it at lysine 95, a modification necessary for myoblast differentiation. This interaction is mediated through the DNA-binding domain of SOX4 and the zinc finger domain of KAT5, highlighting a specific and critical interaction for transcriptional regulation during differentiation (Jang2015KAT5mediated).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, KAT5 interacts with the c-Myc transcription factor, co-regulating the c-Myc-dependent transcriptional network. This interaction is significant, as a large majority of KAT5 binding sites overlap with those of c-Myc, indicating a collaborative role in transcription regulation (Ravens2015Tip60).
