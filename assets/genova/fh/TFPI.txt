# TFPI

## Overview
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a gene that encodes a critical protein involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. The protein, also named TFPI, is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa (TF-FVIIa) complex and factor Xa (FXa), thereby modulating the initiation of the coagulation cascade (Wood2014Biology; Baugh1998Regulation). TFPI exists in multiple isoforms, primarily TFPIa and TFPIb, which differ in their structure and cellular localization, influencing their specific functions in coagulation regulation (Wood2014Biology). The protein's activity is enhanced by interactions with cofactors such as Protein S, which further facilitate its anticoagulant properties (Hackeng2006Protein). Given its crucial role in maintaining hemostatic balance, alterations in TFPI expression or function are associated with various thrombotic disorders and have implications in cancer prognosis (Tinholt2015Tumor; Ma2022Case).

## Structure
The tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a protein characterized by its three tandem Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains, which play a crucial role in inhibiting coagulation factors, specifically factor VIIa and factor Xa (Han1999Structural; Kato2024Tissue). The primary structure of TFPI includes an acidic amino-terminal region and a basic carboxy-terminal region, which is essential for binding to cell surfaces and enhancing the internalization and degradation of factor Xa (Broze1995TISSUE; Han1999Structural). 

TFPI exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with TFPIa and TFPIb being the major isoforms. TFPIa contains three Kunitz-type domains (K1, K2, K3) and a basic C terminus, while TFPIb has the K1 and K2 domains followed by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored C terminus (Wood2014Biology). The second Kunitz domain is primarily responsible for inhibiting factor Xa, while the first domain inhibits the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex (Broze1995TISSUE; Han1999Structural).

Post-translational modifications of TFPI include N-linked glycosylation and partial phosphorylation, which are observed in TFPI expressed by endothelial and kidney cells (Girard1993[11]). These modifications may influence TFPI's physiological function, although their exact roles are not fully understood (Girard1993[11]).

## Function
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a critical regulator of blood coagulation in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by inhibiting the initiation of the coagulation cascade, specifically targeting the tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa (TF-FVIIa) complex and factor Xa (FXa) (Wood2014Biology; Baugh1998Regulation). TFPI exists in two major isoforms, TFPIa and TFPIb, which have distinct roles and localizations. TFPIa is found in platelets and is released upon activation, while TFPIb is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells (Wood2014Biology).

TFPIa contains three Kunitz-type inhibitor domains and a basic C terminus, which are essential for its anticoagulant activity. It inhibits prothrombinase during coagulation initiation through an interaction with factor Va (FVa) (Wood2014Biology). Protein S acts as a cofactor for TFPIa, enhancing its inhibition of FXa (Hackeng2006Protein). TFPIb, anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, is more effective at inhibiting FXa than soluble TFPIa due to its localization on the cell surface (Wood2014Biology).

TFPI's regulation of coagulation is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance, preventing excessive clot formation, and modulating the severity of bleeding and clotting disorders (Wood2014Biology; Baugh1998Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TFPI gene are associated with various thrombotic disorders. A novel mutation in the TFPI gene has been linked to Behçet's disease, characterized by recurrent deep vein thrombosis and dural sinus thrombosis, which are resistant to standard anticoagulation therapy. This mutation highlights the potential role of TFPI in thrombophilia, especially in conditions like Behçet's disease where vasculitis and coagulation disturbances coexist (Ma2022Case).

Low plasma levels of TFPI are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Studies have shown that individuals with TFPI levels below the 10th percentile have a higher risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (Dahm2003Low). The Leiden Thrombophilia study found that low TFPI levels are a weak risk factor for venous thromboembolism, with a moderate risk increase for recurrent events after anticoagulation withdrawal (Sachs2022Markers).

Alterations in TFPI expression are also implicated in cancer. In breast cancer, low TFPI expression is associated with decreased overall survival, particularly in aggressive subtypes. TFPI acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is linked to clinicopathological parameters, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Tinholt2015Tumor).

## Interactions
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) interacts with several proteins to regulate coagulation. TFPI forms a complex with Protein S, which acts as a cofactor to enhance TFPI's inhibition of Factor Xa (FXa) and the tissue factor-factor VIIa (TF-FVIIa) complex. This interaction is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance, particularly at low procoagulant stimuli (Peraramelli2012TFPIdependent; Hackeng2006Protein). Protein S binds to the KD3 domain of TFPI, facilitating the formation of the FXa/TFPI complex and enhancing the anticoagulant activity of TFPI (Peraramelli2012TFPIdependent; Hackeng2006Protein).

TFPI also interacts with Factor V (FV), which, like Protein S, enhances the inhibition of FXa. The presence of both FV and Protein S increases the effectiveness of TFPI in regulating FXa activity (Peraramelli2012TFPIdependent). In plasma, TFPI is often found in complex with lipoproteins, and its interaction with heparin can increase its release from the vessel wall, enhancing its anticoagulant function (Peraramelli2012TFPIdependent; Xu2002Effect).

These interactions are significant for the regulation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and deficiencies in TFPI or its cofactors, such as Protein S, are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (CASTOLDI2010Hereditary).
