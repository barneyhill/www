# GNGT2

## Overview
The GNGT2 gene encodes the G protein subunit gamma transducin 2, a critical component of the phototransduction pathway in human cone photoreceptors. This protein is categorized as a G protein subunit and plays a pivotal role in the visual signaling cascade, which is essential for color vision and visual acuity in bright light conditions. The GNGT2 protein, also known as Gγc, is involved in coupling cone visual pigments to phosphodiesterase, thereby regulating cGMP levels and influencing the hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells (Ong1997Gene). The gene is specifically expressed in cone cells and is localized in the cone outer segments of the retina, highlighting its specialized function in cone photoreceptor activity (Ong1997Gene). Additionally, GNGT2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including asthma and Alzheimer's disease, through its involvement in complex signaling pathways and interactions (Ibanez2022Deletion; Dong2020Integrated).

## Structure
The GNGT2 gene encodes the gamma subunit of the human cone G-protein, known as Gγc, which is a 69-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 7746 Da (Ong1997Gene). The primary structure of Gγc includes a CXXX motif at the C-terminus, which serves as a signal sequence for posttranslational modifications such as farnesylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation (Ong1997Gene). These modifications are crucial for the protein's attachment to the membrane and its functional role in phototransduction.

The GNGT2 protein shares 85% amino acid sequence identity with its bovine counterpart and has significant sequence identity with other human gamma subunits, Gγ1 (64%) and Gγ11 (62%) (Ong1997Gene). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that Gγc is localized in the cone outer segments of the human retina, where it colocalizes with the Gβ3 subunit, indicating its role in forming a functional G protein complex (Ong1997Gene). The gene structure consists of three exons and two introns, with exon 2 containing the protein initiation codon and the first 28 amino acids, while exon 3 includes the remaining 41 amino acids and the 3-untranslated region (Ong1997Gene).

## Function
The GNGT2 gene encodes the gamma subunit of the cone G-protein, specifically the Gγc subunit, which plays a critical role in the phototransduction process in human cone photoreceptors. This process is essential for color vision and the ability to see in bright light. The Gγc subunit is involved in coupling the cone visual pigment to phosphodiesterase, a key component of the signaling cascade that regulates the opening and closing of cGMP-regulated cation channels. This regulation ultimately leads to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell, a mechanism similar to that in rod cells, although the specific components and interactions in cones are less well characterized (Ong1997Gene).

The GNGT2 gene is specifically expressed in cone cells, as indicated by immunohistochemical staining, and the Gγc subunit is localized in the cone outer segments of the human retina, highlighting its role in cone photoreceptor function (Ong1997Gene). The protein shares a high degree of sequence identity with its bovine counterpart and other human Gγ subunits, such as Gγ1 and Gγ11, suggesting a conserved function across species (Ong1997Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The GNGT2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In the context of moderate-to-severe asthma, GNGT2 is identified as a significant risk gene. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs17637472, rs11265180, and rs1867087 are associated with severe asthma, and changes in GNGT2 expression have been observed in asthma patients, suggesting its role in the disease's etiology (Dong2020Integrated).

In Alzheimer's disease, the deletion of the Abi3-Gngt2 gene in mouse models has shown to influence amyloid β and tau pathologies. The loss of GNGT2 expression leads to an immune phenotype characterized by reactive gliosis and an AD-associated gene expression profile, affecting tauopathy progression (Ibanez2022Deletion).

GNGT2 is also involved in the chemokine signaling pathway, which interacts with obesity to modify pancreatic cancer risk. Alterations in GNGT2 expression may contribute to the inflammatory and immune responses associated with cancer progression (Tang2014Genes–Environment). In Cushing's disease, GNGT2 is identified as a hub gene, with its expression linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Lv2020Identification).

## Interactions
The GNGT2 gene encodes the gamma subunit of transducin, a G protein involved in phototransduction. In its Gβ-bound form, the GNGT2 protein exhibits a highly extended α-helical structure that engages in coiled-coil formation with the N-terminal tail of the Gβ subunit. This structure is supported by specific interactions with the corresponding helical segments of the Gβ subunit, indicating that the extended α-helical structure is dependent on the interaction with Gβ (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The GNGT2 protein is expected to be highly disordered in its unbound form, which correlates with its ability to form coiled-coil structures (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The GNGT2 gene is also co-regulated with the ABI3 gene, and their deletion in mice has been shown to influence Alzheimer's disease pathologies, suggesting a functional synergy between these genes. However, specific physical interactions of the GNGT2 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Ibanez2022Deletion). The role of GNGT2 in cone phototransduction and its expression in microglia further highlight its involvement in complex signaling pathways (Ibanez2022Deletion).
