# TAAR6

## Overview
TAAR6, or trace amine-associated receptor 6, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of trace amines, which are biogenic amines present in low concentrations in the brain. The TAAR6 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is implicated in various physiological processes beyond olfaction, including potential roles in neurotransmitter systems and behavioral modulation (Glyakina2021Search; Xie2008Cloning). Although the specific endogenous ligands for TAAR6 remain unidentified, it is known to interact with aliphatic amines like cadaverine and putrescine (Glyakina2021Search). TAAR6 is expressed in the human brain, particularly in regions associated with mental health disorders, such as the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, suggesting a possible involvement in psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Vaganova2022Public). Despite its low mRNA expression levels, the receptor's protein expression may be significant due to low turnover rates, indicating a potential impact on cellular functions and signaling pathways (Vaganova2022Public).

## Structure
The TAAR6 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its primary structure, which consists of a sequence of amino acids forming seven transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs (Xie2008Cloning). The secondary structure includes these transmembrane alpha helices, which are crucial for its function as a receptor. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, which is essential for ligand binding and receptor activation (Glyakina2021Search).

TAAR6 contains specific amino acid residues, such as aspartic acid, which are critical for forming hydrogen bonds with ligands. These residues are located at Asp78, Asp112, and Asp202, which define the orthosteric binding sites for various ligands, including biogenic amines like cadaverine and putrescine (Glyakina2021Search). The presence of conserved motifs and potential disulfide bridges, formed by cysteine residues, contributes to the stability of the receptor structure (Glyakina2021Search).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are predicted to occur at specific sites, including casein kinase II sites at S236 and S240, and a protein kinase C site at S244, which may influence the receptor's function (Xie2008Cloning).

## Function
TAAR6, a member of the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in recognizing biogenic amines, such as cadaverine and putrescine, which are signals for survival (Glyakina2021Search). Although traditionally considered olfactory receptors, TAARs, including TAAR6, have functions beyond the olfactory system, potentially influencing neurotransmitter systems and modulating mood, cognition, and behavior (Glyakina2021Search; Vaganova2022Public).

TAAR6 is expressed in the human brain, particularly in areas related to mental disorders, such as the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (Vaganova2022Public). In the nucleus accumbens, TAAR6 is co-expressed with olfactory receptors in GABAergic medium spiny neurons, which are involved in social behavior, stress response, reward, and aversion (Vaganova2022Public). Despite its low mRNA expression levels, TAAR6 may have significant protein expression due to low protein turnover (Vaganova2022Public).

The receptor's molecular activities include potential orthosteric and allosteric ligand-binding sites, although specific endogenous ligands have not been identified (Vaganova2022Public). TAAR6's role in cell biology and its specific functions in healthy human cells remain areas for further research (Katolikova2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The TAAR6 gene has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TAAR6, such as rs4305745 and rs6903874, which may influence the risk and clinical presentation of these disorders. However, the associations have not been consistently replicated across different populations, highlighting the complexity of these genetic links (Rutigliano2019Molecular). 

TAAR6 expression is generally low and sporadic in brain regions associated with mental disorders, such as the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. This limited expression suggests that TAAR6 may be expressed in a restricted number of cells, potentially affecting social behavior, stress response, and reward mechanisms (Vaganova2022Public). Despite the low expression levels, TAAR6 polymorphisms have been linked to variations in treatment response, particularly with antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole in schizophrenia patients (Vaganova2022Public).

The gene's role in mental disorders is further complicated by its interactions with other genes, such as the heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) gene, which may contribute to the genetic risk profile for mood disorders (Pae2010Investigation).

## Interactions
TAAR6, a trace amine-associated receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has been studied for its potential interactions with various ligands and its role in signaling pathways. Despite its classification as a GPCR, TAAR6 does not appear to interact with monoamines in the same way as other receptors in its family, such as TAAR1. Studies have shown that TAAR6 does not alter cAMP levels, cell impedance, or ERK phosphorylation in response to monoamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and trace amines such as β-phenylethylamine, octopamine, tryptamine, and tyramine (Xie2008Cloning). 

TAAR6 has been associated with cellular membranes and is detectable on the cell surface in transfected cells, but it does not show signaling linkage to Gs or Gi proteins when exposed to monoamines (Xie2008Cloning). The receptor's lack of interaction with monoaminergic pathways suggests that it may not participate in the same signaling processes as other trace amine-associated receptors. Despite this, TAAR6 has been implicated in potential interactions with aliphatic ligands like putrescine and cadaverine, although these interactions are not confirmed as endogenous (Vaganova2022Public).
