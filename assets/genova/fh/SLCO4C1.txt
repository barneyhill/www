# SLCO4C1

## Overview
The SLCO4C1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4C1 (OATP4C1), which is a transmembrane transporter primarily expressed in the kidneys. As a member of the solute carrier family, OATP4C1 plays a pivotal role in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes, particularly in the renal proximal tubules. This protein is involved in the uptake and efflux of various compounds, including the uremic toxin asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and the cardioprotective amino acid L-homoarginine, thereby contributing to cardiovascular health and homeostasis (Taghikhani2019The). The SLCO4C1 gene has also been associated with several cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Hu2020Knockdown; Svoboda2018Clinical).

## Function
The SLCO4C1 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 4C1 (OATP4C1), which is a member of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family. This protein is primarily expressed in the kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes. OATP4C1 is localized in the basolateral membrane of human proximal tubule cells, facilitating the uptake of the uremic toxin asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and the efflux of the cardioprotective amino acid L-homoarginine (Taghikhani2019The).

The transporter is involved in maintaining homeostasis by mediating the uptake of ADMA for degradation and exporting L-homoarginine into the systemic circulation. This function is significant for cardiovascular health, as elevated levels of ADMA and low levels of L-homoarginine are associated with cardiovascular events and mortality (Taghikhani2019The). OATP4C1's activity is characterized by its ability to transport these substrates in a concentration-dependent manner, with specific Km values indicating their affinity for the transporter (Taghikhani2019The). The protein's role in renal transport highlights its potential impact on the handling of uremic toxins and cardioprotective compounds, suggesting therapeutic potential in conditions like chronic kidney disease (Taghikhani2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLCO4C1 gene has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and prognosis. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), SLCO4C1 expression is associated with a negative impact on overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 3.74, suggesting it as a significant risk factor. This may be due to its role in the accumulation of uremic toxins, which can damage tissues beyond the kidneys (Svoboda2018Clinical).

In prostate cancer, SLCO4C1 promoter hypermethylation is observed, leading to decreased gene expression. This epigenetic alteration is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor biochemical recurrence-free survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2019SLCO4C1).

In endometrial cancer, SLCO4C1 is significantly upregulated and linked to poor prognosis and advanced clinical stages. Its expression promotes cell proliferation and metastasis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown studies demonstrate that reducing SLCO4C1 expression can inhibit these processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2020Knockdown).
