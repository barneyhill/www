# ATXN7L3B

## Overview
ATXN7L3B is a gene that encodes the protein ataxin 7 like 3B, which is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with components of the deubiquitinase (DUB) module. Unlike its paralog ATXN7L3, which is primarily nuclear, the ATXN7L3B protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating distinct functional roles within the cell (Li2016Cytoplasmic). The protein is known to interact with ENY2 and USP22, influencing the stability and activity of the SAGA DUB module, although it does not associate with the SAGA complex itself (Li2016Cytoplasmic). ATXN7L3B's ability to modulate histone modification, particularly through its impact on monoubiquitinated histone H2B (H2Bub1), underscores its potential regulatory role in gene expression and cellular processes (Li2016Cytoplasmic). The gene's involvement in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Li2016Cytoplasmic; Leberfarb2019Potential).

## Function
ATXN7L3B is a protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation by modulating the activity of the SAGA complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and histone modification. Unlike its paralog ATXN7L3, which is primarily nuclear, ATXN7L3B is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, suggesting distinct cellular functions (Li2016Cytoplasmic). ATXN7L3B interacts with ENY2 and USP22, components of the deubiquitinase (DUB) module, but does not associate with the SAGA complex itself (Li2016Cytoplasmic). It competes with ATXN7L3 for ENY2 binding, which affects the stability and activity of the SAGA DUB module (Li2016Cytoplasmic).

Overexpression of ATXN7L3B leads to increased levels of monoubiquitinated histone H2B (H2Bub1), indicating its role in modulating DUB activity (Li2016Cytoplasmic). This suggests that ATXN7L3B may interfere with the nuclear functions of the SAGA DUB module by sequestering ENY2 and destabilizing ATXN7L3, thereby limiting USP22 activity toward H2Bub1 (Li2016Cytoplasmic). The protein's interactions and effects on histone modification highlight its potential regulatory role in gene expression and cellular processes. However, the specific function of ATXN7L3B in healthy cells remains less clear, as much of the research focuses on its implications in cancer cell lines (Li2016Cytoplasmic).

## Clinical Significance
ATXN7L3B has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes and interactions. Alterations in ATXN7L3B expression levels have been linked to breast cancer, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. High expression of ATXN7L3B in these cells is associated with increased cell migration, suggesting a role in cancer progression. Knockdown of ATXN7L3B reduces the expression of ER target genes and significantly decreases cell migration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer (Li2016Cytoplasmic).

In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ATXN7L3B gene, such as rs590352, have been associated with increased CRC risk, particularly in men. This SNP is located in exon 1 of the gene and may affect transcription factor binding, potentially altering gene expression and contributing to CRC susceptibility (Leberfarb2019Potential).

Additionally, loss of ATXN7L3B has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Family members with a loss in the chromosome region 12q21, where ATXN7L3B is located, exhibit motor and cognitive deficiencies, learning difficulties, and cerebellar ataxia, suggesting a potential link to neurological conditions (Li2016Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
ATXN7L3B interacts with components of the deubiquitinase (DUB) module, specifically ENY2 and USP22, although its interaction with USP22 is weaker compared to ATXN7L3 (Li2016Cytoplasmic). ATXN7L3B competes with ATXN7L3 for binding to ENY2, which is crucial for the DUB module's enzymatic activity (Li2016Cytoplasmic; CornelioParra2021Function). This competition is supported by in vitro experiments showing that ATXN7L3B can form a complex with USP22 and ENY2, although this complex exhibits weak deubiquitinase activity towards histone H2Bub1, suggesting it may target non-histone proteins in vivo (Li2016Cytoplasmic).

ATXN7L3B does not associate with the SAGA complex as a whole, as indicated by the absence of other SAGA components in ATXN7L3B-associated proteins (Li2016Cytoplasmic). It also does not interact with the TREX-2 complex, showing only a weak interaction with CETN2 and no interaction with other TREX-2 components (Li2016Cytoplasmic). Knockdown of ATXN7L3B leads to a decrease in ENY2 protein levels, suggesting a regulatory relationship, although this regulation does not occur at the mRNA level (Li2016Cytoplasmic). These interactions highlight ATXN7L3B's role in modulating protein interactions and its potential impact on cellular processes.
