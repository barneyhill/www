# DNAJA3

## Overview
DNAJA3 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member A3, which is a co-chaperone involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the Hsp40 family, this protein plays a critical role in assisting Hsp70 proteins with protein folding, assembly, and translocation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. DNAJA3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it is involved in mitochondrial protein import, quality control, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) pathway. It also plays a significant role in modulating apoptosis, stress responses, and inflammatory pathways, including JAK-STAT signaling. The protein's interactions extend to viral inhibition, as seen in its interaction with the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) S1 protein, and it is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Zheng2022DNAJA3; Maletzko2021Increased).

## Function
DNAJA3, a member of the Hsp40 family, functions as a co-chaperone that assists Hsp70 proteins in various cellular processes, including protein folding, assembly, and translocation. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by being actively involved in mitochondrial protein import and quality control. DNAJA3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it influences apoptosis and stress responses (Maletzko2021Increased).

In the context of mitochondrial function, DNAJA3 is involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) pathway. It accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix in the absence of ClpP, suggesting it may be a degradation substrate of ClpP or co-accumulate with such substrates. This accumulation is linked to its role in modulating JAK-STAT signaling and mediating the transcriptional induction of interferon-stimulated genes, indicating its involvement in inflammatory responses (Maletzko2021Increased).

DNAJA3 also shows increased presence in the nucleus during mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting its involvement in the immune response triggered by mitochondrial stress. This nuclear presence, along with STAT1, suggests a role in the transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory factors, highlighting its function in innate immunity modulation (Maletzko2021Increased).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the DNAJA3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In gastric cancer, DNAJA3, also known as Tid1, is involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance and regulates cancer cell migration and invasion. High expression of Tid1 is associated with less aggressive tumor behavior and better disease-free survival rates, while its knockdown increases cell migration and invasion, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Wang2020DNAJA3Tid1). In renal cell carcinomas, hTid-1, encoded by DNAJA3, acts as a regulator of c-Met receptor signaling, influencing cell motility and migration. Overexpression of hTid-1 enhances cell motility, while its depletion reduces cell motility and correlates with STAT3 inactivation, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Copeland2011hTID1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, DNAJA3 accumulation is linked to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration. In ClpP-null mice, DNAJA3 accumulation mediates inflammatory responses, potentially influencing conditions like ataxia and neuropathy. This accumulation is associated with neurodegeneration networks and diseases such as Leigh syndrome, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's (Maletzko2021Increased). DNAJA3 is also mentioned in the context of developmental delay and polyneuropathy, although specific pathogenic variants are not detailed (Dilliott2022DnaJC7).

## Interactions
DNAJA3, a member of the Hsp40 family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the S1 protein of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV), inhibiting viral adsorption to host cells and thereby negatively regulating PEDV replication. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down assays, and confocal imaging, identifying the interaction region on the S1 protein as amino acids 379-479 (Zheng2022DNAJA3).

In the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, DNAJA3 accumulates in ClpP-null mouse models, suggesting it may be a degradation substrate of ClpP or co-accumulate with such substrates. It is involved in mitochondrial translation, respiratory NADH dehydrogenase activity, and mitochondrial nucleoid processes. DNAJA3 also interacts with the HSP70 family, confirming its role as a co-chaperone (Maletzko2021Increased).

DNAJA3 modulates JAK-STAT signaling and mediates transcriptional induction of interferon-stimulated genes, possibly through direct protein interactions. It influences inflammatory responses via STAT1, STAT3, and NFκB pathways, and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like spinocerebellar ataxia (Maletzko2021Increased).
