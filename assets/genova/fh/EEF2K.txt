# EEF2K

## Overview
The EEF2K gene encodes the protein eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a unique member of the α-kinase family, which is distinguished by its ability to phosphorylate residues within α-helices. eEF2K plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), thereby inhibiting its function and slowing down the elongation phase of protein translation. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for conserving cellular energy, particularly under stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. The activity of eEF2K is modulated by calcium ions and calmodulin, as well as various signaling pathways, including mTORC1 and AMPK. Beyond its role in protein synthesis, eEF2K is involved in several physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity, immune response, and cellular energy balance. Its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2016Eukaryotic; Ballard2021Insights; Wang2017Eukaryotic).

## Structure
Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is a unique protein kinase characterized by its preference for phosphorylating residues in α-helices, a feature that aligns it with the 'α-kinases' family (Ballard2021Insights; Wang2017Eukaryotic). The catalytic domain of eEF2K is located towards the N-terminus and is essential for its kinase activity, sharing structural similarities with other α-kinases like Dictyostelium myosin-II heavy chain kinase A and TRPM7 (Wang2017Eukaryotic). This domain comprises two lobes, with nucleotides binding between them, resembling the architecture of classical protein kinases (Wang2017Eukaryotic).

eEF2K also contains a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, which is crucial for its activity and is dependent on Ca2+ ions (Ballard2021Insights). The C-terminal region includes four SEL1-like α-helical motifs involved in protein-protein interactions, although the extreme C-terminal end does not provide a primary binding site for eEF2 (Wang2017Eukaryotic). The structure is further characterized by a linker region with several phosphorylation sites, connecting the catalytic and SEL1 regions (Wang2017Eukaryotic).

eEF2K undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at various sites, which regulate its activity. Notable phosphorylation sites include Thr348, Ser78, and Ser366, which are influenced by pathways such as mTORC1 and AMPK (Browne2004A; Wang2017Eukaryotic; Johanns2017Direct). The protein's regulation is complex, involving multiple signaling pathways and feedback mechanisms (Ballard2021Insights). However, detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is a unique protein kinase that plays a critical role in regulating protein synthesis in healthy human cells. It achieves this by phosphorylating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which inhibits its activity and slows down the elongation phase of protein translation, a highly energy-consuming process (Ballard2021Insights; Liu2016Eukaryotic). This regulation is crucial for conserving energy, particularly under conditions of stress such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and energy depletion (Liu2016Eukaryotic; Wang2017Eukaryotic).

eEF2K is activated by calcium ions and calmodulin, which bind to its catalytic domain, and its activity is modulated by various signaling pathways, including mTORC1 and AMPK (Liu2016Eukaryotic; Ballard2021Insights). In the nervous system, eEF2K is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory function, influencing protein translation in dendrites and impacting neuronal processes (Ballard2021Insights). It also plays a role in maintaining cellular energy balance and protein synthesis regulation, which are vital for cell function and viability (Liu2016Eukaryotic).

eEF2K is involved in the immune response, regulating protein synthesis during inflammation and infection, and is implicated in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction and vascular biology (Ballard2021Insights). Its activity is not essential for mammalian development, suggesting its role is more regulatory than essential, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2016Eukaryotic).

## Clinical Significance
The eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K) gene is implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating protein synthesis. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), EEF2K dysregulation is linked to cognitive impairments. Hyperphosphorylation of eEF2, regulated by EEF2K, is observed in AD patients, contributing to synaptic failure and memory loss. Genetic reduction of EEF2K in AD model mice alleviates these symptoms, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Beckelman2019Genetic).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), increased EEF2K activity is associated with alpha-synuclein toxicity, a hallmark of the disease. Inhibition of EEF2K reduces this toxicity, indicating its potential for therapeutic intervention (Jan2018Activity). EEF2K activity is also linked to mitochondrial deficits and oxidative stress in PD, further supporting its role in the disease's pathophysiology (Jan2018Activity).

EEF2K is also involved in cancer, where its expression is upregulated in response to the tumor microenvironment, aiding in tumor survival and proliferation. However, its inhibition can suppress certain cancer growths, highlighting its dual role in cancer biology (Ballard2021Insights). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EEF2K in various diseases, making it a promising target for therapeutic development.

## Interactions
EEF2K, or eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence its activity and function. It is activated by the binding of calcium ions (Ca2+) and calmodulin (CaM) to its Ca2+/CaM-binding domain, which subsequently activates its catalytic domain (Ballard2021Insights). EEF2K forms complexes with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and disruption of this complex leads to eEF2K ubiquitination, highlighting its regulation through protein-protein interactions (Ballard2021Insights).

EEF2K is also involved in interactions that regulate its phosphorylation state. It is phosphorylated at Ser-366 by p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), part of the mTOR pathway, which inhibits its activity (Ballard2021Insights). Additionally, eEF2K is targeted for degradation by the SCF βTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase via phosphorylation at Ser-441 and Ser-445 (Ballard2021Insights).

In the context of ribosome function, eEF2K phosphorylates eEF2 at Thr56, which affects its interaction with GDP and the ribosome, leading to conformational changes that modulate ribosome recycling and translation elongation (Smith2021Functionally). These interactions are crucial for eEF2K's role in regulating protein synthesis and cellular stress responses.
