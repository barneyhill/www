# CARD9

## Overview
CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family member 9) is a gene that encodes a signaling adaptor protein crucial for immune system function, particularly within myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The CARD9 protein is characterized by its caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitates interactions with other proteins involved in immune signaling pathways. It plays a pivotal role in the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the body's defense against fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. CARD9 is integral to the formation of the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is vital for immune responses, particularly in the context of fungal infections. Mutations in the CARD9 gene are linked to increased susceptibility to fungal infections and various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, underscoring its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Zhong2018Molecular; Drummond2018Human; Bertin2000CARD9).

## Structure
CARD9 is a 536-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62.3 kDa. It contains an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) spanning residues 7-98, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with apoptosis-related proteins like BCL10 and RAIDD (Bertin2000CARD9). The CARD domain is characterized by six or seven antiparallel α-helices that facilitate specific homophilic interactions (Bertin2000CARD9). 

The central region of CARD9, encompassing residues 140-420, contains heptad repeats typical of coiled-coil structures, which are crucial for protein oligomerization (Bertin2000CARD9). This region is predicted to have at least three coiled-coil regions with a high probability of formation (Bertin2000CARD9). CARD9 can self-associate and interact with BCL10 through the CARD domain, forming part of the CARD-CC/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complexes essential for NF-κB activation (De2018A).

The R70W mutation in CARD9 affects its protein expression and disrupts NF-κB activation by inhibiting the recruitment of BCL10 and MALT1, preventing the formation of functional CBM signalosomes (De2018A). CARD9 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as TRIM62-mediated K27-linked ubiquitination at residue K125, which is essential for NF-κB signaling (Zhong2018Molecular).

## Function
CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family member 9) is a signaling adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. It is involved in the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Ruland2008CARD9; Liu2022CARD9). CARD9 functions downstream of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and intracellular NOD receptors, facilitating immune responses against fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens (Zhong2018Molecular; Drummond2018Human).

In the context of fungal infections, CARD9 is critical for activating antifungal immune responses, particularly in the central nervous system, oral mucosa, and skin. It forms part of the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is crucial for the production of inflammatory mediators through the activation of NF-κB and ERK pathways (Drummond2018Human). CARD9 also influences adaptive immunity by affecting T-cell activation and Th17 polarization, which are important for effective immune responses (Drummond2018Human).

CARD9's role extends to the regulation of autophagy and the body's response to infections, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to infections in healthy human cells (Liu2022CARD9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARD9 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to a range of fungal infections and inflammatory diseases. CARD9 deficiency, an autosomal recessive condition, predisposes individuals to both mucosal and systemic fungal diseases, such as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and systemic candidiasis, particularly affecting the central nervous system (Drummond2016Mechanistic; Drummond2015CARD9Dependent). Specific mutations, like the Q295X mutation, result in a loss of function and are linked to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis due to impaired signaling from the dectin-1 receptor, leading to reduced Th17 cell numbers (Glocker2009A).

CARD9 mutations also contribute to inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, by affecting intestinal immune responses and microbiota composition (Zhong2018Molecular). Additionally, CARD9 is implicated in autoimmune diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and IgA nephropathy, and plays a role in cancer progression by influencing tumor cell proliferation and macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment (Zhong2018Molecular). The gene's dysfunction can lead to impaired cytokine production and defective neutrophil recruitment, crucial for combating fungal infections (Drummond2015CARD9Dependent).

## Interactions
CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family member 9) is a key adaptor protein involved in various immune signaling pathways. It interacts with BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is essential for activating the NF-κB pathway, a critical component of immune responses against fungi, bacteria, and viruses (Zhong2018Molecular; Liu2022CARD9). CARD9 is activated by phosphorylation at Thr231 by protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), which facilitates its interaction with BCL10 through CARD-CARD interactions (Park2019Caspase; Ji2021The).

The C-terminal region of CARD9 interacts with TRIM62, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates CARD9 at Lys125, promoting NF-κB signaling. This interaction is disrupted in CARD9 variants lacking the C terminus, such as CARD9 D11, which acts in a dominant-negative manner (Cao2015Ubiquitin). CARD9 also interacts with Rubicon, which acts as a feedback inhibitor by displacing CARD9 from the CBM complex, thereby terminating CARD9-mediated signaling (Liu2022CARD9; Cao2015Ubiquitin).

CARD9 is involved in the activation of MAPK pathways through interactions with proteins like NOD2 and receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2), further highlighting its role in immune signaling (Zhong2018Molecular).
