# CTLA4

## Overview
CTLA4, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, is a gene that encodes a critical immune checkpoint receptor involved in the regulation of T cell responses. The protein product, CTLA-4, is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its role as an inhibitory receptor on T cells. CTLA-4 is primarily expressed on activated T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), where it functions to attenuate immune responses by outcompeting the costimulatory receptor CD28 for binding to B7 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Thompson1997The; Van2020Molecular). This competitive binding is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. The CTLA4 gene and its protein product are of significant clinical interest due to their involvement in various immune dysregulation syndromes, autoimmune diseases, and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy (Egg2018Increased; Schubert2014Autosomal).

## Structure
CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is a type 1 glycoprotein that primarily exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer, a structure that is unusual for signaling receptors (Thompson1997The; Schwartz2001Structural). The protein is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and features domains similar to immunoglobulin variable (V-type) domains, akin to TCR β-chains and antibody VL and VH domains (Schwartz2001Structural). The CTLA-4 monomers are organized as two-layer β-sandwiches, with the front and back sheets containing specific strand arrangements (Schwartz2001Structural).

The quaternary structure of CTLA-4 involves a covalent dimerization through a disulfide bond between Cys 122 of each monomer, forming an extended network at the T-cell/APC interface (Schwartz2001Structural). The dimer interface is formed by residues near the G strand and A9 strand, burying a surface area of 723 Å² (Schwartz2001Structural). CTLA-4's extracellular domain is sufficient for its inhibitory function, even in the absence of the cytoplasmic tail (Walker2015Confusing).

CTLA-4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may stabilize the homodimer (Schwartz2001Structural). The protein also has splice variants, such as soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4), which lacks the transmembrane domain (Hosseini2020CTLA4:).

## Function
CTLA4, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, is a critical immune checkpoint receptor that plays a significant role in regulating T cell responses. It is primarily expressed on activated T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), where it functions as an immune attenuator by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation. CTLA4 achieves this by binding to the B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with higher affinity than the costimulatory receptor CD28, effectively outcompeting CD28 for these ligands and thus inhibiting T cell activation (Thompson1997The; Van2020Molecular).

In Tregs, CTLA4 is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. It mediates suppression and anergy by interacting with costimulatory ligands on APCs, and its expression is dependent on the transcription factor Foxp3 (Tai2012Basis; Wing2008CTLA-4). CTLA4 also plays a role in the induction of T cell anergy and the inhibition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Thompson1997The).

CTLA4's function is predominantly cell-extrinsic, influencing the behavior of other cells by modifying the phenotype of APCs and regulating the priming of naive T cells through the downregulation of costimulatory ligands via trans-endocytosis (Walker2017EFIS). This regulatory mechanism is essential for controlling peripheral T cell responses and maintaining immune tolerance (Walker2013Treg).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTLA4 gene are associated with a range of immune dysregulation syndromes, characterized by both autoimmunity and immunodeficiency. These mutations can lead to conditions such as hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and multiple autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and type 1 diabetes (Schubert2014Autosomal). CTLA4 mutations result in reduced expression of the CTLA-4 protein, impairing the suppressive function of regulatory T cells and disrupting immune homeostasis (Schubert2014Autosomal).

CTLA4 insufficiency is linked to an increased risk of malignancies, particularly lymphomas and gastric cancers, often associated with viral infections like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) (Egg2018Increased). The gene's role in maintaining immune balance is crucial, as its deficiency can lead to lymphoproliferation and lymphoid infiltrations in various organs (Egg2018Increased).

Alterations in CTLA4 expression are also implicated in autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, where polymorphisms in the gene affect mRNA stability and protein expression, contributing to disease manifestations (Wang2002Abnormal). CTLA4 mutations can lead to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, influenced by additional genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors (Schubert2014Autosomal).

## Interactions
CTLA4 interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in T cell signaling and immune regulation. It associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, specifically binding to the TCRζ chain. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of the kinase p56lck and is involved in inhibiting early TCR signaling events by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation of key signaling proteins (Lee1998Molecular).

CTLA4 also binds to the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, forming a complex with the TCR complex in activated T cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domains of SHP-2 and is influenced by the phosphorylation status of CTLA4's cytoplasmic tail (Lee1998Molecular; Marengère1996Regulation). The binding of SHP-2 to CTLA4 is phosphotyrosine-dependent, specifically involving the YVKM motif (Marengère1996Regulation).

CTLA4 interacts with clathrin-associated proteins, such as the µ2 subunit of the AP-2 complex and AP50, which are involved in its intracellular trafficking. These interactions are negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, with specific residues in CTLA4's cytoplasmic tail being critical for binding (Bradshaw1997Interaction; Zhang1997Interaction). The phosphorylation status of CTLA4 influences its binding to different effector molecules, affecting its internalization and signaling functions (Bradshaw1997Interaction).
