# RNF213

## Overview
RNF213 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 213, also known as Mysterin, which is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase with a complex molecular structure. This protein is characterized by its RING finger motif, indicating its role in ubiquitination, and an AAA ATPase domain, which is typical of energy-dependent unfoldases (Ahel2021E3; Liu2011Identification). RNF213 is involved in various cellular processes, including vascular development, angiogenesis, and immune regulation, and is expressed in multiple human tissues, particularly in immune-related tissues (Kamada2010A). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as UBC13 and ISG15, highlight its role in immune responses and pathogen defense (Zhang2023The; Thery2021Ring). Clinically, mutations in the RNF213 gene are significantly associated with Moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder, and other vascular conditions, underscoring its importance in vascular and immune-related pathologies (Dorschel2023Physiological; Liu2011Identification).

## Structure
RNF213, also known as mysterin, is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase with a complex molecular structure. The protein is composed of several distinct domains, including a dynein-like ATPase core and a unique E3 ligase module. The ATPase core contains six AAA units, which are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, and are organized into a ring-shaped oligomeric complex (Ahel2020Moyamoya; Morito2014Moyamoya). The E3 module of RNF213 is characterized by a non-canonical zinc finger active site, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity. This module includes a catalytic cysteine nucleophile, Cys4462, which participates in the transthiolation reaction with E2~Ub (Ahel2021E3).

The protein's structure is further organized into three major components: the N-arm, AAA core, and E3 module. The N-arm is a long stalk composed of helical bundles, while the AAA core and E3 module form a multipartite AAA-E3 machine (Ahel2020Moyamoya). RNF213's E3 activity is regulated by ATP binding and is sensitive to the ATP/ADP/AMP ratio, with the protein's structure allowing for dynamic changes in its oligomeric state (Ahel2021E3; Morito2014Moyamoya). The protein also exists in multiple isoforms, which may influence its function and interactions (Pollaci2022Novel).

## Function
RNF213, also known as Mysterin, is a multifunctional protein involved in several cellular processes, including ubiquitination and ATP hydrolysis. It contains a RING finger motif, indicating its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and an AAA ATPase domain, which is typical of energy-dependent unfoldases (Kamada2010A; Liu2011Identification). RNF213 is expressed in various human tissues, with high expression in immune tissues such as the spleen and leukocytes, suggesting a role in immune function (Kamada2010A).

In endothelial cells, RNF213 is crucial for normal vascular development and angiogenesis. It regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is involved in cell cycle progression, influencing endothelial cell proliferation (Ohkubo2015Moyamoya). RNF213 also interacts with the PI3K-AKT pathway, affecting phosphorylated AKT levels and linking inflammatory and angiogenic signals (Ohkubo2015Moyamoya).

RNF213's role in angiogenesis is complex, acting as an anti-angiogenic factor in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. Its loss-of-function is associated with increased microvessel network formation, implicating the VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in this process (Roy2022RNF213). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and vascular integrity (Liu2011Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF213 gene are significantly associated with Moyamoya disease (MMD), a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis of cerebral arteries. The p.R4810K variant of RNF213 is particularly linked to MMD in East Asian populations, with a high prevalence in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese individuals (Jang2017Frequency; Liu2011Identification). This variant is also associated with intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS) and noncardiogenic ischemic stroke, particularly large artery atherosclerosis (Kobayashi2021RNF213). 

RNF213 mutations are implicated in other vascular diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease (Dorschel2023Physiological). The gene's dysfunction is linked to reduced angiogenic potential and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, although RNF213 dysfunction alone does not cause vascular lesions, suggesting the involvement of other factors (Kobayashi2021RNF213). 

In addition to vascular conditions, RNF213 variants are associated with immune and inflammatory responses, potentially affecting cerebral endothelium integrity and contributing to Moyamoya angiopathy pathogenesis (Dorschel2023Physiological). The gene's role in linking inflammatory and angiogenic signals in endothelial cells further underscores its clinical significance in vascular and immune-related disorders (Ohkubo2015Moyamoya).

## Interactions
RNF213, a large E3 ubiquitin ligase, participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with UBC13 (UBE2N), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, to facilitate K63-linked ubiquitination, which is crucial for its function in lipid storage and immune regulation (Zhang2023The). RNF213 also interacts with ISG15, an interferon-stimulated protein, forming a complex that enhances its antimicrobial activity. This interaction is essential for RNF213's role in restricting viral and bacterial infections, as demonstrated by its ability to recruit ISGylated proteins to lipid droplets (Thery2021Ring).

RNF213 is involved in the ubiquitylation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a process independent of its RING domain but requiring its AAA+ ATPase activity. This interaction is vital for antibacterial autophagy and the restriction of cytosolic Salmonella proliferation (Pollaci2022Novel). Additionally, RNF213 interacts with several proteins associated with innate immunity, such as UBA7, USP18, and PARP14, which are involved in the immune response to viruses (Pollaci2022Novel). These interactions highlight RNF213's multifaceted role in immune regulation and pathogen defense.
