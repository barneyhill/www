# ANKRD31

## Overview
ANKRD31 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 31 protein, which is integral to the process of meiotic recombination. This protein functions primarily as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of protein complexes that promote DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis, a critical step for homologous recombination and chromosome segregation. Ankyrin repeat domain 31 interacts with key proteins such as REC114 and MEI4, stabilizing their association with meiotic chromosomes and ensuring efficient DSB formation (Boekhout2018REC114; Papanikos2018ANKRD31). Additionally, ANKRD31 is crucial for DSB formation in the pseudoautosomal regions of sex chromosomes, which is vital for their pairing and recombination (Boekhout2018REC114). Beyond its role in meiosis, ANKRD31 contributes to the structural integrity of the epididymal epithelium, essential for sperm maturation (Manfrevola2021Ankrd31). Mutations in ANKRD31 have been associated with reproductive disorders, including premature ovarian insufficiency, highlighting its significance in reproductive health (Wang2021Pathogenic).

## Structure


## Function
The ANKRD31 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic recombination, particularly in the regulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis. ANKRD31 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of DSB-promoting protein complexes on meiotic chromosome axes. It interacts with proteins such as REC114 and MEI4, stabilizing their association with chromosomes and promoting efficient DSB formation, which is essential for homologous recombination and proper chromosome segregation (Boekhout2018REC114; Papanikos2018ANKRD31).

ANKRD31 is particularly important for the formation of DSBs in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of sex chromosomes, which is critical for their pairing and recombination. In its absence, there is a significant reduction in DSB activity in these regions, leading to failures in sex chromosome pairing and recombination, which can result in sterility (Boekhout2018REC114; Papanikos2018ANKRD31).

In addition to its role in meiosis, ANKRD31 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the epididymal epithelium, which is essential for sperm maturation and motility. It interacts with junctional proteins, contributing to the stability of the blood-epididymal barrier (BEB) (Manfrevola2021Ankrd31).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKRD31 gene have been linked to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by the loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40. Specific variants, such as the nonsense variant p.Gln329* and the splice site variant c.1565-2A>G, disrupt the interaction between ANKRD31 and REC114, a protein crucial for meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation. These disruptions can lead to impaired DSB formation, affecting homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and contributing to POI (Wang2021Pathogenic).

In mouse models, ANKRD31 mutations result in increased DSBs and reduced efficiency in DSB regulation, leading to POI-like characteristics such as reduced numbers of primordial follicles and oocytes, and smaller ovarian volumes (Ding2023DNA). ANKRD31 is also essential for proper meiotic recombination and fertility, with its deficiency leading to reproductive issues in both sexes, including male sterility due to spermatogenic arrest and reduced oocyte reserves in females (Papanikos2019Mouse; Boekhout2018REC114).

These findings highlight the critical role of ANKRD31 in reproductive health, with mutations potentially leading to infertility and other reproductive disorders.

## Interactions
ANKRD31 is a meiosis-specific protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in the regulation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It directly interacts with REC114, a component of the RMMAI protein complex involved in DSB formation. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region of ANKRD31, which wraps around the N-terminal region of REC114, forming a stable heterodimer (Boekhout2018REC114; Lampitto2024Recent). The interaction is highly conserved among vertebrates, suggesting its evolutionary importance (Boekhout2018REC114).

ANKRD31 also interacts with other proteins involved in meiotic recombination, such as MEI4, MEI1, and IHO1, forming complexes that are essential for the proper assembly of recombinosomes and the initiation of recombination (Papanikos2019Mouse; Boekhout2018REC114). ANKRD31 aggregates in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of sex chromosomes and at the ends of certain autosomes, indicating its role in ensuring recombination between sex chromosomes (Papanikos2019Mouse).

ANKRD31's interaction with REC114 is mutually exclusive with its interaction with TOPOVIBL, indicating a complex network of interactions that regulate DSB formation (Lampitto2024Recent). These interactions suggest that ANKRD31 functions as a scaffold, coordinating the assembly of multiple proteins necessary for DSB formation and repair.
