# ACAT2

## Overview
ACAT2, or acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2, which is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cholesterol metabolism and energy homeostasis by catalyzing the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, a critical step in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway essential for cholesterol synthesis (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme; Ma2022Hepatic). Predominantly active in the liver and small intestine, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 influences cholesterol absorption and the synthesis of cholesterol esters, thereby maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme). The enzyme's activity is crucial for lipid metabolism regulation, impacting dietary cholesterol absorption and the prevention of cholesterol-related disorders. Given its significant role in cholesterol metabolism, ACAT2 is a potential therapeutic target for conditions such as atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia (Rudel2005ACAT2).

## Function
ACAT2 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cholesterol metabolism and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells. It catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, a key step in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for cholesterol synthesis (Ma2022Hepatic). ACAT2 is primarily active in the liver and small intestine, where it influences cholesterol absorption and the synthesis of cholesterol esters (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme). This enzyme is part of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family and is responsible for esterifying free cholesterol with fatty acid-CoA to form cholesteryl ester, thus playing a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme).

In the liver, ACAT2 is involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, which is a precursor in ketogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis (Ma2022Hepatic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for regulating lipid metabolism, as it helps manage the balance between cholesterol and fatty acid levels in the body. ACAT2's function in cholesterol metabolism is particularly important in the context of dietary cholesterol absorption and the prevention of cholesterol-related disorders (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACAT2 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders, particularly those involving cholesterol metabolism. Increased expression of ACAT2 in the jejunal mucosa has been associated with cholesterol gallstone disease. In a study involving Chinese patients, those with gallstones exhibited significantly higher mRNA levels of ACAT2 compared to gallstone-free individuals, suggesting that upregulated cholesterol absorption and esterification in the small intestine may contribute to gallstone formation (Jiang2009Increased).

ACAT2 also plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis. The enzyme is responsible for the esterification of cholesterol in the liver and small intestine, contributing to the formation of cholesteryl esters in lipoproteins. These esters are implicated in the accumulation of cholesterol in the arteries, promoting atherosclerosis. Studies in animal models have shown that ACAT2 deficiency leads to reduced aortic atherosclerosis, indicating that ACAT2-derived cholesteryl esters are more atherogenic than triglycerides (Rudel2005ACAT2).

The potential for targeting ACAT2 as a therapeutic strategy is highlighted by its role in hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease. Inhibiting ACAT2 could reduce plasma cholesteryl ester levels and prevent atherosclerosis without destabilizing cellular membrane function (Rudel2005ACAT2).

## Interactions
ACAT2 interacts with several proteins involved in its regulation and function. It is stabilized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the oxidation of cysteine residue C277, which prevents its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78, along with Insig1/2, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of ACAT2. Overexpression of wild-type gp78 promotes ACAT2 degradation, while a dominant-negative mutant of gp78 increases ACAT2 levels. Knockdown of gp78 or Insigs results in increased ACAT2 levels, indicating their role in ACAT2 degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that ACAT2 directly binds to Insig1 but not to gp78, suggesting that Insigs mediate the interaction between ACAT2 and gp78 (Wang2017Cholesterol).

ACAT2 is also involved in cholesterol metabolism and interacts with proteins such as Ufd1, VCP, and UBE2G2 via gp78's cytosolic domain. Insigs act as adaptors to recruit substrates like ACAT2 and HMGCR. The ubiquitination of ACAT2 and HMGCR by gp78 is regulated in opposite directions depending on cholesterol levels (Wang2017Cholesterol). These interactions highlight ACAT2's role in sensing lipid overload and oxidative stress, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.
