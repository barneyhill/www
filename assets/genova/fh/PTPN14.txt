# PTPN14

## Overview
PTPN14 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and receptor trafficking. As a non-receptor type phosphatase, PTPN14 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway by interacting with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), thereby influencing cell growth and apoptosis. Additionally, PTPN14 is implicated in the modulation of receptor presentation on the cell surface, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The gene's significance extends to its role as a tumor suppressor, with mutations and altered expression linked to various cancers and other diseases (Belle2015The; Wang2012PTPN14; Mamai2021PTPN14).

## Structure


## Function
PTPN14 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the BMP9 signaling pathway in endothelial cells by protecting SMAD4 from ubiquitination and degradation, thereby stabilizing SMAD4 protein levels and enhancing BMP9 signaling. This interaction supports vascular quiescence and is crucial for maintaining endothelial cell function and structure (Mamai2021PTPN14).

PTPN14 also acts as a negative regulator of YAP1, a component of the Hippo signaling pathway. It inhibits YAP1's transcriptional activity by promoting its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation and maintaining normal cell morphology. This regulation is independent of PTPN14's phosphatase activity but requires its PY motifs for binding to YAP1 (Michaloglou2013The; Wang2012PTPN14).

In addition to its role in signaling pathways, PTPN14 influences receptor trafficking by interacting with proteins such as PRKCD and RIN1, affecting their phosphorylation status and modulating receptor presentation on the cell surface. This regulation is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive receptor presentation, which can impact cell signaling and function (Belle2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PTPN14 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cancer, PTPN14 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene. Loss-of-function variants in PTPN14 are associated with an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma and cervical cancer, with carriers of these variants showing a higher probability of developing these cancers by age 70 (Olafsdottir2021LossofFunction). In breast cancer, reduced expression of PTPN14 is linked to increased metastasis and poor survival outcomes, as it plays a role in suppressing the cell surface presentation of growth-promoting receptors (Belle2015The).

PTPN14 also plays a significant role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), where it acts as a genetic modifier influencing the development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Variations in PTPN14 have been shown to modify the risk of developing these malformations in individuals with HHT (Benzinou2012Mouse). In osteosarcoma, PTPN14 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting YAP1 signaling, and its expression is decreased in osteosarcoma cell lines (Liang2020PTPN14). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of PTPN14 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PTPN14 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a transcriptional co-activator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. PTPN14 binds to YAP1 through its PPXY motifs, interacting with the WW domains of YAP1. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of YAP1 activity, as PTPN14 promotes the translocation of YAP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity (Huang2012YAP; Wang2012PTPN14).

PTPN14 also interacts with proteins involved in protein trafficking, such as RIN1 and PRKCD. These interactions are important for PTPN14's role in inhibiting metastasis by altering protein trafficking pathways. The binding of PTPN14 to these proteins is phosphorylation-dependent, particularly for PRKCD, which affects receptor trafficking and cytokine secretion (Belle2015The).

In the context of cancer, PTPN14 is targeted for degradation by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 proteins. This interaction involves the C-terminal phosphatase domain of PTPN14 and the C terminus of E7, leading to PTPN14 degradation and contributing to the oncogenic activity of HPV (White2016High-Risk).
