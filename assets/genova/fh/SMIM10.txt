# SMIM10

## Overview
The SMIM10 gene encodes the small integral membrane protein 10, a mitochondrial protein that plays a role in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its integral membrane nature. SMIM10 has been identified as a key immune-associated gene, particularly in the context of keratoconus, a progressive eye disorder. It is involved in immune regulation processes and has been suggested as a potential diagnostic biomarker for keratoconus. The gene's involvement in immune pathways highlights its significance in disease pathogenesis, although its broader implications in other conditions remain to be fully elucidated (Niu2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The SMIM10 gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes a mitochondrial protein and has been implicated in various cellular processes. In the context of keratoconus (KC), a progressive eye disorder affecting the cornea, SMIM10 has been identified as one of the key immune-associated genes (IAGs) that may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers. The study by Niu et al. highlights SMIM10's involvement in immune regulation processes related to KC, suggesting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Niu2023Identification). The gene is part of a group of 10 IAGs identified through machine learning algorithms, which are significantly associated with cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, indicating their potential role in regulating immunological features during KC progression (Niu2023Identification).

While SMIM10 has been noted for its role in selectively downregulating BRAFV600E RNA and protein levels in melanoma cells, the specific diseases or conditions directly associated with SMIM10 gene mutations or expression alterations beyond its role in KC are not well-documented. The study emphasizes the need for further investigation into the roles of these genes, including SMIM10, in corneal cells and their potential impact on KC pathology (Niu2023Identification).
