# TYROBP

## Overview
TYROBP, also known as DAP12, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane immune signaling adaptor protein crucial for various cellular processes, particularly in the immune system. The protein product of TYROBP is characterized by its role as a transmembrane adaptor, containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that is essential for signal transduction in immune cells. This protein is involved in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and microglial cells, playing a significant role in immune responses and central nervous system homeostasis. TYROBP's interactions with receptors such as TREM2 are particularly notable in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, where it influences microglial activity and amyloid-beta clearance. Additionally, TYROBP is implicated in bone metabolism through its expression in osteoclasts, highlighting its multifaceted roles in both immune and skeletal systems (HaureMirande2017Deficiency; Sekiya2018Integrated; Paloneva2000Lossoffunction).

## Structure
TYROBP, also known as DAP12, is a transmembrane signaling adaptor protein that plays a critical role in immune cell activation. The protein typically forms a disulfide-linked homodimer, which is essential for its functional activity. This dimerization is crucial for the stability and signaling capacity of TYROBP. The protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within its cytoplasmic domain. This motif is a key structural feature that undergoes phosphorylation upon activation, facilitating downstream signaling pathways.

The primary structure of TYROBP includes specific amino acid sequences that allow for the formation of the ITAM, which is vital for its role in signal transduction. The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the provided context, but the presence of the ITAM suggests a configuration that supports its phosphorylation and interaction with other signaling molecules. TYROBP associates with various receptors on immune cells, indicating a structural adaptability to engage with different partners.

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are common and essential for the signaling role of TYROBP. These modifications occur on the ITAM, enhancing its ability to transmit activation signals within immune cells. The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms or specific domains beyond the ITAM.

## Function
The TYROBP gene encodes a transmembrane signaling adaptor protein, also known as DAP12, which plays a crucial role in immune cell activation. In natural killer (NK) cells, TYROBP associates with activating receptors that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, facilitating the identification and destruction of infected or cancerous cells. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within TYROBP, which recruits protein tyrosine kinases such as SYK and ZAP70, leading to cellular activation and immune response (Lanier1998Association; Paloneva2000Lossoffunction).

TYROBP is also expressed in microglial cells and astrocytes in the brain, where it is involved in the clearance of apoptotic tissue, contributing to central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Its role in microglial activity is essential for maintaining brain health and responding to pathological conditions (HaureMirande2017Deficiency; Paloneva2000Lossoffunction).

In the skeletal system, TYROBP is involved in osteoclast function, playing a role in bone remodeling. Its expression is significantly higher in osteoclasts compared to other cells, indicating its importance in bone metabolism (Paloneva2002Mutations). Overall, TYROBP is vital for normal immune function and has additional roles in brain and bone health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TYROBP gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD). In Alzheimer's disease, TYROBP is implicated in the pathology and progression of the disease. It acts as a downstream adaptor for microglial receptors that interact with amyloid-beta, a key component in AD. TYROBP expression is increased in AD patients and mouse models, and rare missense coding variants have been identified in familial early-onset AD. TYROBP deficiency in mouse models has shown neuroprotective effects, improving learning behavior and synaptic function, potentially due to decreased levels of complement protein C1q (HaureMirande2017Deficiency; HaureMirande2022Microglial).

In Nasu-Hakola disease, also known as polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), mutations in TYROBP lead to presenile dementia and bone cysts. These mutations result in a loss of function, disrupting the interaction between TYROBP and ligand-binding receptors on natural killer cells, although no abnormalities in NK cell function are observed in patients. The pathogenesis of NHD may involve the inability of microglial cells to clear apoptotic tissue in the brain and osteoclast dysfunction leading to bone cysts (Paloneva2000Lossoffunction).

## Interactions
TYROBP, also known as DAP12, is a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a significant role in immune signaling by interacting with various receptors. It forms a signaling complex with TREM2, a receptor associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, facilitating signal transduction in microglia, the brain's resident immune cells (HaureMirande2017Deficiency; Lee2021Computational). TYROBP also interacts with CR3 and SIRPβ1 receptors, which are involved in phagocytosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (HaureMirande2017Deficiency). These interactions are crucial for the formation of phagocytic synapses on microglia, contributing to the immune response in the brain.

In Drosophila models, TYROBP stabilizes TREM2, as evidenced by the detection of TREM2 proteins only when co-expressed with TYROBP, indicating a stabilizing interaction (Sekiya2018Integrated). This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TYROBP's role extends to influencing various molecular pathways, including those related to synaptic function and immune response, highlighting its importance in neurodegenerative diseases like AD (Sekiya2018Integrated). The interaction between TYROBP and TREM2 is also implicated in exacerbating tau-mediated neurodegeneration, emphasizing its role in AD pathogenesis (Sekiya2018Integrated).
