# HSD17B4

## Overview
The HSD17B4 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in steroid metabolism and peroxisomal beta-oxidation. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is primarily localized in peroxisomes, where it is involved in the oxidation of 17-beta-estradiol to estrone and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis (de1999Unique; Violante2018Peroxisomes). The protein consists of three distinct domains: an N-terminal dehydrogenase domain, a central hydratase domain, and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2)-like domain, each responsible for different catalytic activities (Leenders1996Porcine; Zhu2019Ceramide). Mutations in HSD17B4 are linked to various metabolic disorders, including D-bifunctional protein deficiency and Perrault syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Chen2017A; Pierce2010Mutations).

## Structure
The HSD17B4 gene encodes a multifunctional protein involved in steroid metabolism and peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The protein is approximately 80 kDa in size and consists of 736 or 737 amino acids, depending on the source (Adamski1995Molecular; de1999Unique). It is composed of three distinct domains: an N-terminal dehydrogenase domain, a central hydratase domain, and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2)-like domain (Leenders1996Porcine; Zhu2019Ceramide).

The N-terminal domain is involved in steroid metabolism and shows homology to short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (SCAD) (de1999Unique). The central domain catalyzes the 2-enoyl-acyl-CoA hydratase reaction, sharing identity with multifunctional enzymes involved in peroxisomal beta-oxidation (Leenders1996Porcine). The C-terminal domain is similar to SCP2, facilitating sterol and phosphatidylcholine transfer between membranes (Leenders1996Porcine).

Post-translational modifications include N-terminal cleavage, producing a 32-kDa fragment with enzymatic activity (de1999Unique). The protein can form dimers, with the 32-kDa fragment forming dimers with an apparent molecular weight of 75 kDa (de1999Unique). The C-terminal domain contains a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1), crucial for peroxisomal import (Zhu2019Ceramide).

## Function
The HSD17B4 gene encodes a multifunctional enzyme known as 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 4 (17-HSD 4), which plays a critical role in several metabolic processes within human cells. This enzyme is localized in peroxisomes and is involved in the metabolism of steroids, fatty acids, and bile acids. It catalyzes the oxidation of 17-beta-estradiol to estrone, a process that is part of a broader metabolic pathway facilitating the release of steroids from cells (de1999Unique). The enzyme also participates in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, particularly medium- and long-chain fatty acids, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis (Violante2018Peroxisomes).

HSD17B4 is a bifunctional enzyme with distinct domains responsible for different catalytic activities. The N-terminal domain catalyzes both 17-hydroxysteroid and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase reactions, while the central domain is responsible for 2-enoyl-acyl-CoA hydratase activity (de1999Unique). This enzyme is essential for the production of acylcarnitines, which are intermediates in fatty acid oxidation, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (Violante2018Peroxisomes). The enzyme's activity is crucial for various metabolic pathways, including cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (de1999Unique).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD17B4 gene are associated with several disorders, primarily affecting peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation. One significant condition linked to HSD17B4 mutations is D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including neonatal hypotonia, seizures, and developmental delays, often leading to early death. DBP deficiency is classified into types based on the affected enzymatic activities: Type I affects both hydratase and dehydrogenase subunits, while Types II and III affect only one of these subunits (Lieber2014Next; Pierce2010Mutations).

HSD17B4 mutations are also implicated in Perrault syndrome, which presents with ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss in females, and sometimes hearing loss in males. This syndrome can include additional symptoms such as ataxia and polyneuropathy (Chen2017A; Pierce2010Mutations).

Furthermore, specific mutations in HSD17B4 have been linked to juvenile and adult-onset disorders, such as juvenile peroxisomal DBP deficiency and middle age-onset spinocerebellar ataxia. These conditions are characterized by milder symptoms compared to infant-onset DBP deficiency, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, hearing loss, and infertility (Amor2016Heterozygous; Matsuda2020Biallelic).

## Interactions
HSD17B4 interacts with several proteins that influence its function and stability. In prostate cancer, HSD17B4 undergoes acetylation at the K669 site, which promotes its degradation through the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway. This process involves interactions with Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 (HSC70) and the lysosomal receptor LAMP2A. The L622/Q623 residues in HSD17B4 are crucial for binding with HSC70, facilitating its degradation (Huang2020Acetylationmediated).

SIRT3 is another protein that interacts with HSD17B4, regulating its acetylation level. SIRT3 decreases K669 acetylation, leading to an accumulation of HSD17B4 protein. The interaction between SIRT3 and HSD17B4 is reduced upon treatment with dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) (Huang2020Acetylationmediated).

In the context of peroxisomal function, HSD17B4 interacts with Pex5, a peroxisomal biogenesis factor. This interaction is regulated by ceramide levels, which influence the translocation of HSD17B4 to peroxisomes. When ceramide levels are low, HSD17B4 translocates to peroxisomes and interacts with Pex5, participating in the beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (Zhu2019Ceramide).
