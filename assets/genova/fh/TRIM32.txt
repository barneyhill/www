# TRIM32

## Overview
TRIM32 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 32, which is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a tripartite motif comprising a RING domain, a B-box domain, and a coiled-coil region, followed by six C-terminal NHL repeats. These structural features enable TRIM32 to participate in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, muscle development, and neuronal differentiation (Esposito2017Structural; Jeong2023Tripartite). The protein is involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis and cellular functions by targeting specific proteins for degradation. TRIM32's activity is crucial in muscle physiology, where it influences muscle remodeling and regeneration, and in neuronal cells, where it aids in neuroblast maturation (Jeong2023Tripartite; Hillje2013TRIM32dependent). Mutations in the TRIM32 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2H and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Bawa2021TRIM32:; Frosk2002LimbGirdle).

## Structure
TRIM32 is a multifunctional protein characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING domain, a B-box domain, and a coiled-coil region, followed by six C-terminal NHL repeats. The RING domain is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, coordinating two zinc ions and facilitating ubiquitin transfer to target proteins (Jeong2023Tripartite; Lazzari2019Analysis). The B-box domain, while not directly involved in catalytic activity, modulates the rate of ubiquitin chain assembly and affects subcellular localization (Jeong2023Tripartite; Lazzari2019Analysis). The coiled-coil region mediates dimerization and potentially higher-order oligomerization, essential for TRIM32's function (Esposito2017Structural).

The NHL repeats form a six-bladed β-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's oligomerization and substrate recognition (Jeong2023Tripartite). TRIM32 undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation and ubiquitylation, which regulate its function and stability. Acetylation of lysine K247 inhibits proteolytic cleavage, while ubiquitylation at K50 and K401 is important for auto-ubiquitylation and cytoplasmic body formation (GarciaGarcia2021Generation).

TRIM32 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the main variant being a 653 amino acid protein and a shorter variant lacking the NHL repeats (GarciaGarcia2021Generation). The short isoform is catalytically inactive, suggesting a dominant negative role (GarciaGarcia2021Generation).

## Function
TRIM32 is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in human cells, primarily through its activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular functions (Jeong2023Tripartite; Locke2009TRIM32). In skeletal muscle, TRIM32 targets proteins such as actin, α-actinin, desmin, and c-Myc, facilitating muscle development, remodeling, and regeneration by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of these proteins (Jeong2023Tripartite).

TRIM32 is also involved in muscle regeneration and atrophy, interacting with various proteins to maintain muscle function and mass (Jeong2023Tripartite). It plays a role in autophagy by polyubiquitinating ULK1, an upstream regulator of autophagy, which is essential for muscle health under atrophic conditions (Jeong2023Tripartite). In the context of neuronal differentiation, TRIM32 regulates the cell cycle exit and promotes the degradation of c-Myc, facilitating neuroblast maturation and differentiation (Hillje2013TRIM32dependent). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes like apoptosis and autophagy (Jeong2023Tripartite).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIM32 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). LGMD2H is a mild autosomal recessive disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, primarily affecting skeletal muscle. It is linked to mutations in the NHL domains of TRIM32, with the D487N mutation being particularly common among affected individuals (Saccone2008Mutations; Frosk2002LimbGirdle). This mutation is also associated with sarcotubular myopathy, suggesting these disorders are allelic variants (Bawa2021TRIM32:).

Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a non-myopathic disorder, is linked to a mutation in the B-box domain of TRIM32. This condition is characterized by retinal dystrophy, obesity, kidney abnormalities, and polydactyly (Bawa2021TRIM32:; Saccone2008Mutations). 

Alterations in TRIM32 expression levels are also implicated in muscle regeneration and myogenesis. Mutations can lead to impaired differentiation and proliferation of myoblasts, contributing to muscle dystrophy (ServiánMorilla2019Altered). These mutations often result in reduced TRIM32 protein levels and increased autophagic flux, affecting muscle homeostasis (ServiánMorilla2019Altered).

## Interactions
TRIM32 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in muscle physiology and pathology. In skeletal muscle, TRIM32 binds to the head and neck region of myosin, a major component of thick filaments, although myosin is not a substrate for its ubiquitination activity (Kudryashova2005Trim32). TRIM32 also ubiquitinates actin, primarily in its monoubiquitinated form, which suggests a role in actin turnover and muscle remodeling (Kudryashova2005Trim32).

TRIM32 interacts with dysbindin, a component of the BLOC-1 complex involved in lysosomal-endosomal trafficking, promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation (Locke2009TRIM32). This interaction is significant in the context of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H, where mutations in TRIM32 impair its ubiquitin ligase activity (Locke2009TRIM32).

TRIM32 also binds to the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1, facilitating its own autophagic degradation, a process crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis (Overå2019TRIM32). Additionally, TRIM32 interacts with the Salmonella effector protein SseK3, which may influence host immune responses during infection (Yang2015SseK3). These interactions highlight TRIM32's diverse roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
