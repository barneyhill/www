# RACK1

## Overview
RACK1 (Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in numerous cellular processes. The RACK1 protein is characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure, which facilitates interactions with a wide array of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a pivotal role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Adams2011RACK1; Sklan2006RACK1). As a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, RACK1 is integral to the regulation of translation and is involved in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and Src kinase (Gandin2013RACK1; Adams2011RACK1). The protein's ability to form both homodimers and heterodimers enhances its scaffolding capabilities, allowing it to coordinate complex cellular processes such as cell motility, growth, and survival (Adams2011RACK1; Sklan2006RACK1). Aberrant expression or modification of RACK1 is associated with several pathologies, including cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Gandin2013RACK1; Buoso2020Ribosomes).

## Structure
RACK1 is a 36 kDa scaffolding protein characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, which is a common feature among WD-repeat proteins (Adams2011RACK1; Sklan2006RACK1). Each blade of the β-propeller consists of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, and the structure is stabilized by interlocking architecture where each WD-repeat overlaps two adjacent propeller blades (Adams2011RACK1). The WD-repeat includes a signature WD dipeptide, with aspartic acid exposed on the lower face of the propeller and tryptophan playing a crucial role in inter-blade spacing (Adams2011RACK1).

RACK1's structure allows it to interact with various proteins, including ribosomal proteins and signaling molecules, facilitating its role in cellular processes (Adams2011RACK1; Sklan2006RACK1). The protein can form both homodimers and heterodimers, enhancing its scaffolding capabilities (Adams2011RACK1; Sklan2006RACK1). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence RACK1's function and interactions (Adams2011RACK1).

The D-A loop between blades 6 and 7 is longer in RACK1 compared to similar proteins, forming a knob-like projection that contributes to its unique structural features (Adams2011RACK1). This structural flexibility is crucial for RACK1's role in neuronal functioning and plasticity (Sklan2006RACK1).

## Function
RACK1 (Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1) is a multifaceted scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in various molecular processes and organismal outcomes. It is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, where it influences translation by recruiting proteins such as protein kinase C (PKC)βII, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6) to facilitate ribosome assembly and translation (Adams2011RACK1). RACK1 is involved in the localization of translation, particularly in neurons, and interacts with the microRNA-induced gene silencing complex, suggesting a role in post-initiation gene repression and translation arrest (Adams2011RACK1).

RACK1 is also crucial for cell motility, protein synthesis, and cell survival. It interacts with over 100 proteins, influencing processes such as cell growth, proliferation, morphology, movement, death, and survival (Gandin2013RACK1). The protein is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including MAPK, PKC, and Src, and is essential for coordinating signaling molecules (Gandin2013RACK1). RACK1's expression is ubiquitous and tightly regulated, with aberrant expression linked to various pathologies, including cancer (Gandin2013RACK1). Its role in cellular control of kinase activity is significant in stress response, cell migration, and mRNA translation (Gandin2013RACK1).

## Clinical Significance
RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In cancer, RACK1 expression is often altered, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, changes in RACK1 levels or its post-translational modifications can influence tumor progression by affecting ribosome composition and function, leading to increased stop codon read-through and promoting cell survival and metastasis (Buoso2020Ribosomes). RACK1 also interacts with β-catenin and PSMD2, enhancing β-catenin stability and promoting breast cancer cell proliferation through the WNT signaling pathway (Tian2023RACK1). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, RACK1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and metastasis via the PI3K/Akt/FAK signaling pathway (Peng2016The).

RACK1 is also involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression, where it interacts with CPNE1 to activate MET signaling, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wang2022CPNE1). Beyond cancer, RACK1's altered expression is linked to brain developmental disorders, heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease, where decreased expression correlates with defective PKC activity (Adams2011RACK1). These findings highlight RACK1's clinical significance in various diseases, particularly in cancer prognosis and therapy resistance.

## Interactions
RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) is a scaffolding protein that interacts with a wide array of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is known to associate with the 40S ribosomal subunit, where it interacts with helices 39 and 40 of the 18S rRNA, positioning itself near the mRNA exit tunnel. This interaction is stabilized by basic residues such as Arg38 and Lys40, which are essential for its ribosome binding (Nilsson2004Regulation; Coyle2009Direct).

RACK1 also interacts with numerous signaling proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, Src kinase, and integrins. It recruits PKC to the ribosome, facilitating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6), which is crucial for translation initiation (Nilsson2004Regulation; Adams2011RACK1). RACK1's interaction with Src kinase is involved in cell spreading and focal adhesion processes (Nilsson2004Regulation).

In addition to its role in translation, RACK1 interacts with proteins involved in cell motility, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphodiesterase PDE4D5, forming complexes that regulate cell migration and adhesion (Gandin2013RACK1; Bolger2017The). It also modulates NF-κB signaling by interacting with the IKK complex, affecting the phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ (Yao2013RACK1).
