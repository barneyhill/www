# FAM163B

## Overview
FAM163B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the protein family with sequence similarity 163 member B. This protein is involved in cellular signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in cell growth and differentiation. It is expressed in various tissues and is particularly implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, suggesting its importance in the formation and function of neural networks. The protein's involvement in cellular signaling indicates potential interactions with other proteins and molecules, contributing to cellular homeostasis and responses to environmental stimuli. While FAM163B has been associated with several diseases, including cancer, its precise molecular functions and pathways remain under investigation, necessitating further research to fully understand its biological and clinical significance (Kouznetsov2022Cell; Zhou2023Interplay; Jung2023Identification; Guo2023Lymph).

## Function
FAM163B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, playing a significant role in cell growth and differentiation. The protein is expressed in various tissues and is thought to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes. It may influence cellular responses to external stimuli, although its exact molecular functions and pathways are still under investigation. The involvement of FAM163B in neurodevelopment suggests that it could be crucial for the proper formation and function of neural networks, potentially affecting cognitive and developmental outcomes. The protein's activity in cellular signaling pathways indicates that it might interact with other proteins and molecules to regulate cellular processes, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and response to environmental changes. Understanding the precise molecular activities of FAM163B and its role in cell biology is essential for elucidating its contributions to organismal health and development. Further research is needed to fully characterize the pathways and interactions in which FAM163B is involved, as well as its specific functions in different cellular contexts.

## Clinical Significance
FAM163B has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, FAM163B was identified as having a high metastasis score, suggesting a potential role in metastasis, although its association with survival outcomes was not highly significant (Jung2023Identification). In cervical cancer, FAM163B was found to be one of the significant hub genes related to lymph node metastasis, with lower expression in metastatic lymph nodes compared to non-metastatic ones. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker in cervical cancer (Guo2023Lymph).

In the context of colorectal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), FAM163B was identified as one of the genes with significant associations through a cross-trait meta-analysis. However, its specific role in fatty acid metabolism, which is a focus of the study, remains unexplored (Zhou2023Interplay). Additionally, FAM163B was noted as significantly down-regulated in cell responses to simulated microgravity, although its clinical significance in this context is not directly addressed (Kouznetsov2022Cell). Despite these findings, the full clinical significance of FAM163B requires further investigation to elucidate its role in disease processes.
