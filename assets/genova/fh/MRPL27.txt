# MRPL27

## Overview
MRPL27 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ribosome's large 39S subunit. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, thereby impacting cellular energy metabolism and respiration (Cheong2020Expression). The MRPL27 protein is involved in various interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome, including its association with the mitoribosome assembly factor Mam33 in yeast, which aids in its proper incorporation and function (Hillman2019The). Additionally, MRPL27 has been implicated in apoptosis regulation through its interaction with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Chintharlapalli2004BMRP). The gene's expression is linked to several clinical conditions, including certain cancers and muscle pathologies, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Bogatikov2020miR19333p; Bao2022Potential).

## Structure


## Function
MRPL27 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit, and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It facilitates the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells, impacting energy metabolism and cellular respiration (Cheong2020Expression). The expression of MRPL27 is temporally regulated, being absent in oocytes, which suggests a specific role during certain developmental stages (Cheong2020Expression). 

In yeast, the proper incorporation of MrpL27 into the ribosome is facilitated by the protein Mam33, which acts as a chaperone to stabilize unassembled ribosomal proteins and prevent their misfolding and aggregation (Hillman2019The). This interaction is crucial for the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, although the specific role of MRPL27 in human cells is not directly addressed in the available studies (Hillman2019The). The evolutionary analysis of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins suggests that MRPL27, like other MRPs, may have additional mitochondria-specific functions beyond its bacterial ancestors, potentially linked to ribosome assembly or function (Smits2007Reconstructing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MRPL27 gene have been associated with various cancers. In cholangiocarcinoma, a highly malignant tumor of the biliary epithelial cells, MRPL27 mRNA levels are significantly upregulated in tumor tissues. Patients with high MRPL27 expression exhibit poorer overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting that MRPL27 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for this type of cancer (Bao2022Potential). Similarly, in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, MRPL27 expression is positively correlated with poor survival, indicating its potential role in the prognosis of this lung cancer subtype (Bao2022Potential).

In the context of muscle pathology, the miRNA miR-1933-3p has been shown to downregulate MRPL27 expression in skeletal muscles of MuSK+ experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) mice. This downregulation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle atrophy, suggesting that MRPL27 may play a role in muscle health and disease (Bogatikov2020miR19333p). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MRPL27 in both cancer and muscle-related conditions.

## Interactions
MRPL27, also known as mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function within the mitochondrial ribosome. It is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) to facilitate mitochondrial protein synthesis. In yeast, MRPL27 interacts with Mam33, a mitoribosome assembly factor, which binds to a subset of large subunit MRPs before their incorporation into the ribosome. This interaction is essential for the proper incorporation of MRPL27 into the ribosome, as the absence of Mam33 leads to decreased levels of MRPL27 and associated respiratory deficiencies (Hillman2019The).

MRPL27 is also known to interact with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in mammalian cells. MRPL27, referred to as BMRP in some studies, binds to Bcl-2 but not to other Bcl-2 family members, suggesting a specific interaction that may play a role in apoptosis regulation (Chintharlapalli2004BMRP). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of MRPL27 in both mitochondrial function and cellular apoptosis.
