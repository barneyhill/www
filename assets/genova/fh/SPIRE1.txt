# SPIRE1

## Overview
SPIRE1 is a gene that encodes the protein spire type actin nucleation factor 1, which is a key player in the regulation of actin filament networks within cells. This protein is categorized as an actin nucleator and is involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial motility and division, as well as vesicular transport. The SPIRE1 protein contains several functional domains, such as WH2 domains for actin binding and a KIND domain for interactions with formin proteins, which collectively facilitate its role in actin assembly and stabilization (Manor2015A; Renault2008Spire). Additionally, SPIRE1 interacts with Rab GTPases and Myosin Vc, linking actin nucleation to cellular structures like Weibel-Palade bodies and influencing processes such as DNA repair and immune response (Holthenrich2022Spire1; Belin2015DNA). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in conditions such as renal cell carcinoma and its role as a virus restriction factor, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Torres2022The; Shu2023Exosomal).

## Structure
SPIRE1 is a protein involved in actin filament nucleation and contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes four WH2 (WASP homology 2) domains, which are crucial for binding actin monomers and facilitating actin assembly. These domains are involved in nucleating actin assembly and can interact with both ends of actin filaments, playing a role in filament elongation and stabilization (Bradley2020Spire; Renault2008Spire).

SPIRE1 also contains a KIND domain, which is involved in protein interactions, particularly with formin proteins, to regulate actin assembly (Manor2015A). The Spir box (SB) domain is essential for dimerization and localization to specific cellular structures, such as Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells, through interactions with Rab GTPases (Holthenrich2022Spire1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence SPIRE1's activity and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. SPIRE1 has a splice variant isoform, Spire1C, which includes a unique ExonC domain that targets it to the mitochondrial outer membrane, indicating a role in mitochondrial division (Manor2015A).

## Function
The SPIRE1 gene encodes an actin nucleator that plays a crucial role in organizing actin filament networks, particularly at vesicle membranes and mitochondria. In healthy human cells, SPIRE1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial motility by coordinating actin and myosin functions. It is targeted to mitochondria through alternative splicing, where it interacts with myosin 5 motor proteins and formin actin filament generators. This interaction helps anchor and position mitochondria within subcellular compartments, opposing their motility and ensuring efficient energy distribution within cells (Straub2020The).

The SPIRE1 protein also plays a role in mitochondrial division. The Spire1C isoform, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, interacts with the ER-anchored protein INF2 to promote actin filament assembly on mitochondrial surfaces. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial constriction and division, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and number in cells (Manor2015A).

In the testis, SPIRE1 is involved in the regulation of ectoplasmic specialization dynamics, which are crucial for germ cell differentiation and transport. It supports the plasticity and dynamics of the ectoplasmic specialization by polymerizing actin into long linear microfilaments (Wen2018Actin).

## Clinical Significance
The SPIRE1 gene, encoding the actin nucleator Spire 1, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in SPIRE1 expression or function can impact renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression. Specifically, the circular RNA circSPIRE1, derived from the SPIRE1 gene, is downregulated in metastatic RCC. This downregulation is associated with poorer disease-free survival and advanced clinical stages, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for RCC prognosis (Shu2023Exosomal). CircSPIRE1 suppresses RCC metastasis by mediating the glycosylation of E-cadherin, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing metastasis (Shu2023Exosomal).

In the context of immune responses, Spire 1 acts as a virus restriction factor, enhancing innate immune signaling pathways. Its absence leads to reduced immune responses and increased viral replication, as demonstrated in studies involving vaccinia and Zika viruses. This suggests that alterations in Spire 1 expression could affect viral infections and immune system efficacy (Torres2022The).

While the role of SPIRE1 in other diseases is not directly mentioned, its involvement in these processes highlights its clinical significance in cancer progression and immune response regulation.

## Interactions
SPIRE1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in actin filament nucleation and cellular processes. It forms complexes with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab27 and Rab3, which are crucial for its localization to Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) in endothelial cells. The C-terminal Spire Box (SB) domain of SPIRE1 is essential for this interaction, facilitating its recruitment to WPB (Holthenrich2022Spire1).

SPIRE1 also interacts with Myosin Vc (MyoVc) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), linking actin nucleation to vesicular transport. This interaction requires the globular tail-binding motif (GTBM) sequences of SPIRE1, as deletion mutants lacking these sequences do not interact with MyoVc (Holthenrich2022Spire1). The interaction between SPIRE1 and MyoVc is important for the formation of actin rings at WPB-plasma membrane fusion sites, which are crucial for the externalization of von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Holthenrich2022Spire1).

In the context of DNA repair, SPIRE1, along with Spire-2, cooperates with Formin-2 (FMN2) to promote the assembly of nuclear actin filaments in response to DNA damage. This interaction is necessary for efficient DNA repair, highlighting SPIRE1's role in nuclear actin dynamics (Belin2015DNA).
