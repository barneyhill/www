# ABCC4

## Overview
The ABCC4 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (MRP4), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP4 functions as an efflux pump, facilitating the transport of a diverse array of substrates across cellular membranes, including signaling molecules such as cyclic nucleotides, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes (Wen2015The; Ritter2005Cellular). This protein is characterized by its four-domain structure, comprising two membrane-spanning domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Conseil2005Polymorphisms; RUSSEL2008Multidrug). MRP4 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain, where it plays critical roles in physiological processes such as detoxification and cellular signaling (Wen2015The; Rius2003Cotransport). The gene's polymorphisms and expression levels have been implicated in drug resistance and clinical outcomes in diseases such as leukemia and cancer, highlighting its significance in pharmacogenomics and therapeutic interventions (Wen2015The; Mesrian2017ABCC4).

## Structure
The ABCC4 gene encodes the Multidrug Resistance Protein 4 (MRP4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP4 is characterized by a conventional four-domain structure, consisting of two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Conseil2005Polymorphisms; RUSSEL2008Multidrug). Each MSD contains six transmembrane helices, resulting in a total of 12 transmembrane helices for the protein (Conseil2005Polymorphisms). The NBDs are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, which powers the transport of substrates across cell membranes (RUSSEL2008Multidrug).

MRP4 has a unique structural feature with a gap of approximately 50 amino acids after the sixth transmembrane helix, which is not present in longer MRPs (RUSSEL2008Multidrug). The protein also contains a conserved PDZ interaction motif, which may play a role in its cellular localization and function (RUSSEL2008Multidrug). Specific amino acids, such as phenylalanines at positions 368 and 369, and charged residues like Arg375 and Arg782, are involved in substrate binding and are conserved across species (RUSSEL2008Multidrug).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, have been observed, which may influence the protein's function and localization (Rius2007ATPDependent). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ABCC4 gene encodes the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP4 functions as an efflux pump, transporting a wide range of substrates across cellular membranes. It is involved in the transport of cellular signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), ADP, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and folic acid, which are essential for intra- and extracellular communication (Wen2015The; Ritter2005Cellular). MRP4 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and platelets, where it plays a role in physiological processes like platelet aggregation, cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, and cardiomyocyte contraction (Wen2015The; Ritter2005Cellular).

In the liver, MRP4 is localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and is involved in the efflux of reduced glutathione (GSH) and bile salts, contributing to detoxification processes (Rius2003Cotransport). In the kidney, MRP4 is found in the proximal tubule apical membrane, where it participates in the transport of organic anions and nucleotides (Ritter2005Cellular). MRP4's ability to transport a broad spectrum of substrates and its involvement in cellular signaling make it a significant player in maintaining normal physiological functions (Wen2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABCC4 gene, which encodes the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), have significant clinical implications. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the G912T polymorphism in ABCC4 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, including lower event-free survival and increased risk of severe toxicity during treatment. This polymorphism may disrupt normal mRNA splicing, leading to reduced ABCC4 expression and affecting drug tolerance (Mesrian2017ABCC4).

ABCC4 is also highly polymorphic, with over 800 missense variants. Some variants, such as 2269G.A, are linked to increased toxicity in thiopurine therapy and a higher risk of leukopenia. Variants like 559G.T are associated with decreased intraocular pressure in response to latanoprost, while others affect drug concentrations and renal elimination (Wen2015The).

In cancer, MRP4 expression is linked to drug resistance and poor clinical outcomes. High MRP4 levels are associated with several cancers, including acute myelocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma. MRP4's role in cancer involves pathways that affect cell cycle regulation and immune suppression, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to treatment (Wen2015The).

## Interactions
ABCC4, also known as MRP4, interacts with the protein MPP1, a PDZ-domain-containing protein, through its PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is crucial for the localization and stabilization of ABCC4 at the plasma membrane, which enhances its function and contributes to drug resistance in leukemia. The interaction between ABCC4 and MPP1 is mediated by the PDZ domain of MPP1 and the PDZ motif of ABCC4, specifically the glutamate-threonine-alanine-leucine (ETAL) sequence (Pitre2017An). 

The presence of MPP1 reduces the mobility of ABCC4 at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. This interaction is disrupted by peptides containing the ABCC4-PDZ motif, which leads to decreased plasma membrane localization of ABCC4 and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs like 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and cytarabine (Pitre2017An). 

In addition to its interaction with MPP1, ABCC4 is involved in the transport of methotrexate (MTX) and is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can affect its transport function (ElSheikh2006Interaction).
