# RPUSD3

## Overview
RPUSD3 is a gene that encodes the protein RNA pseudouridine synthase D3, an enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial RNA through pseudouridylation. This enzyme plays a critical role in the modification of specific mitochondrial mRNAs, such as COXI and COXIII, which are essential for the synthesis of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, particularly complex IV (Antonicka2016A). Unlike other pseudouridine synthases, RPUSD3 does not influence mitochondrial ribosome assembly but enhances the efficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis, thereby modulating the expression of the mitochondrial transcriptome (Ding2024Implications). The protein is part of a functional module that includes interactions with other proteins like TRUB2 and RPUSD4, contributing to the regulation of mitochondrial 16S rRNA and translation (Hilander2021The). RPUSD3 has also been implicated in various clinical contexts, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with patient prognosis and immune landscape, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Jin2022Integrative).

## Function
RPUSD3 (RNA pseudouridine synthase D3) is a crucial enzyme involved in the pseudouridylation of mitochondrial RNA, specifically targeting mRNAs such as COXI and COXIII. This modification is essential for the efficient synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, which are vital for the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, particularly complex IV (Antonicka2016A). The enzyme operates within mitochondrial RNA granules, contributing to post-transcriptional RNA modification and ribosome assembly, which are critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and cell viability (Antonicka2016A).

RPUSD3's activity does not affect the stability of mRNA but significantly enhances the efficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis, underscoring its role in modulating the expression of the mitochondrial transcriptome (Ding2024Implications). Unlike other pseudouridine synthases, RPUSD3 does not impact mitochondrial ribosome assembly, indicating a distinct function in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Antonicka2016A).

The enzyme's role in pseudouridylation contributes to the stabilization of RNA structures, enhancing local RNA stacking and increasing the rigidity of the phosphodiester backbone, which is crucial for various RNA functions, including protein synthesis (Ding2024Implications). RPUSD3's activity is essential for cellular homeostasis and viability, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial biology.

## Clinical Significance
RPUSD3 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPUSD3 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. High expression levels of RPUSD3 are associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival in HCC patients, indicating its role as an independent prognostic marker (Jin2022Integrative). However, RPUSD3 expression is also linked to poor survival outcomes in some contexts, highlighting its complex role in cancer progression (Jin2022Integrative).

RPUSD3 is involved in the immune landscape of HCC, where its expression negatively correlates with immune cell abundance and functions, such as the IFN response and T cell co-stimulation. This suggests a role in tumor progression and immune evasion (Jin2022Integrative). In rectal cancer, RPUSD3 mutations have been associated with a complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, indicating its potential role in treatment response (Bagaria2022Discriminating). These findings underscore the importance of RPUSD3 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RPUSD3 is involved in various interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules. It is part of a functional module that includes proteins such as TRUB2, RPUSD4, and RCC1L, which are involved in regulating mitochondrial 16S rRNA and translation. Although RPUSD3 does not directly affect the sedimentation pattern of mitoribosome proteins, it interacts with TRUB2 and RPUSD4, suggesting a role in the pseudouridine synthetase module (Hilander2021The).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPUSD3 expression is negatively correlated with immune cell types and functions, indicating its potential role in influencing the tumor microenvironment. This suggests that RPUSD3 may interact with components of the immune system, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (Jin2022Integrative).

RPUSD3 has also been identified as a target of TRUB1 in studies using direct RNA sequencing, indicating its involvement in pseudouridylation processes. This interaction highlights RPUSD3's role in RNA modification and its potential regulatory functions in cellular processes (Fanari2024Probing).

Overall, RPUSD3 participates in complex interactions that influence RNA stability and function, particularly within mitochondrial and cancer-related contexts.
