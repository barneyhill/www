# PLG

## Overview
The PLG gene encodes plasminogen, a glycoprotein that serves as the precursor to plasmin, a serine protease enzyme integral to the fibrinolytic system. Plasminogen is primarily involved in the breakdown of fibrin clots, thus playing a vital role in maintaining vascular health and preventing thrombosis (Urano2018Regulation). The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple kringle domains and a serine protease domain, facilitating its interaction with various proteins and cell surfaces (Loy2001Domain; Mangel1990Characterization). These interactions are crucial for its activation and function in processes such as cell migration, tissue remodeling, and immune response (Saksela1985Plasminogen; Plow1990Plasminogen). Mutations in the PLG gene can lead to clinical conditions such as plasminogen deficiency and hereditary angioedema, highlighting its significance in human health (BritoRobinson2024Plasminogen; Bork2017Hereditary).

## Structure
Plasminogen (PLG) is a glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain with 790 amino acids, organized into several distinct domains. The primary structure includes an N-terminal peptide, five kringle domains, and a serine protease domain (Loy2001Domain; Mangel1990Characterization). The kringle domains are looped structures stabilized by disulfide bonds and contain lysine-binding sites, which are crucial for interactions with other proteins such as fibrin (Loy2001Domain; Mangel1990Characterization).

The secondary structure of plasminogen is predominantly composed of antiparallel β-sheets and β-turns, with minimal α-helix content (Mangel1990Characterization). The tertiary structure is described as a compact, spiral conformation in its native form, known as Glu-plasminogen, which transitions to a more extended form upon activation to Lys-plasminogen (Loy2001Domain; Marshall1994Conformational).

Plasminogen undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which contributes to its structural diversity and function (Takada1988Physiology). The protein exists in different isoforms, such as Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen, which differ in their N-terminal residues and conformational states, influencing their interaction with receptors and activation rates (Takada1988Physiology; Lähteenmäki2001Bacterial).

## Function
Plasminogen (PLG) is a crucial precursor to plasmin, an enzyme that plays a significant role in fibrinolysis, the process of breaking down fibrin clots, thereby maintaining vascular health and preventing thrombosis (Urano2018Regulation). In healthy human cells, plasminogen is involved in pericellular proteolysis, which is essential for cell migration, tissue differentiation, maintenance, and remodeling (Saksela1985Plasminogen; Plow1990Plasminogen). 

Plasminogen binds to cell surfaces, including blood cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, with high capacity and similar affinity, facilitating its conversion to plasmin. This conversion is crucial for degrading matrix constituents, aiding in cell migration by breaking down proteinaceous barriers (Plow1990Plasminogen). The binding of plasminogen to cell receptors enhances its activation, allowing localized proteolytic activity and protecting it from inhibitors like α2-antiplasmin (Plow1990Plasminogen).

The activation of plasminogen is regulated by plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which are found in various tissues and fluids (Saksela1985Plasminogen). This activation is more efficient on cell surfaces, where plasminogen is protected from its principal physiological inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin, allowing for localized proteolysis (Ellis1991Plasminogen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the plasminogen (PLG) gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Plasminogen deficiency, particularly type I (PDI), is characterized by low or undetectable levels of plasminogen, leading to reduced plasmin activity and compromised fibrin clearance. This condition is often inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and can result in ligneous conjunctivitis, impaired wound healing, and other mucosal diseases (BritoRobinson2024Plasminogen). 

Certain missense variants of the PLG gene, such as PLG/K 311 E, are linked to hereditary angioedema (HAE) with normal C1 inhibitor, a condition marked by increased bradykinin production and edema (BritoRobinson2024Plasminogen; Bork2017Hereditary). Other variants, like PLG/R 504 W, are associated with lower plasma plasminogen levels and an increased risk of thrombosis (BritoRobinson2024Plasminogen).

Alterations in PLG expression or interactions can also contribute to inflammatory diseases. For instance, the PLG/D 219 N variant has been implicated in cystic fibrosis by affecting lung host-pathogen interactions (BritoRobinson2024Plasminogen). The kringle domains of PLG are critical regions where destabilizing substitutions may lead to misfolding and increased clearance, potentially contributing to disease (BritoRobinson2024Plasminogen).

## Interactions
Plasminogen (PLG) interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in fibrinolysis and other physiological processes. One significant interaction is with streptokinase (SK), a bacterial protein that forms a complex with PLG, facilitating its activation to plasmin. This interaction involves the binding of SK's three domains (R, β, and γ) to specific regions of PLG, with the β domain initially binding to kringle 5 of PLG, leading to a conformational change that allows full activation (Loy2001Domain; Conejero‐Lara1998Analysis).

PLG also interacts with histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG), which modulates its activation. HPRG can enhance PLG activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) when bound to glycosaminoglycan surfaces, increasing catalytic efficiency significantly. This interaction is pH-dependent and can either promote or inhibit PLG activation depending on the presence of other molecules like fibrinogen fragments (Borza2004Effects).

In the context of bacterial pathogenesis, PLG binds to proteins on the surface of Leptospira interrogans, aiding in the degradation of extracellular matrix components. This interaction is mediated through lysine-binding sites and is crucial for bacterial invasion (Vieira2012Plasminogen).
