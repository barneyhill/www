# CAVIN1

## Overview
CAVIN1, also known as caveolae associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a crucial structural protein involved in the formation and function of caveolae, which are small, flask-shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by CAVIN1 is categorized as a scaffold protein, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the caveolar structure by interacting with caveolins and other membrane components. This interaction is essential for the biogenesis and maintenance of caveolae, impacting various cellular processes such as lipid metabolism, signal transduction, and endocytosis (Briand2011Cavin; Hill2008PTRFCavin). Mutations in the CAVIN1 gene are associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4 (CGL4), a disorder characterized by a near-total absence of body fat and muscular dystrophy, underscoring the gene's significance in metabolic and muscular functions (Mancioppi2023A; Sorkina2020Unusual).

## Structure
CAVIN1, also known as caveolae associated protein 1, is a key structural component of the caveolar coat complex. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its oligomerization and interaction with other proteins. CAVIN1 contains two coiled-coil domains: the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (HR1) and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (HR2). The HR1 domain forms a trimeric coiled-coil structure composed of parallel alpha helices, facilitating the self-assembly of CAVIN1 into trimers and higher-order oligomers (Stoeber2016Model; Kovtun2014Structural). The HR2 domain also contributes to the formation of these oligomers, promoting the assembly of CAVIN1 into a flexible, net-like protein mesh (Stoeber2016Model).

CAVIN1 is involved in forming 60S oligomers, which are essential for the stability and function of caveolae (Stoeber2016Model). The protein's intrinsically disordered regions (DR domains) play a role in electrostatic interactions and liquid-liquid phase separation, which are important for its function in caveolae formation (Tillu2021Cavin1). These disordered regions contribute to the dynamic and flexible nature of CAVIN1, allowing it to interact with caveolin and other membrane components (Tillu2021Cavin1).

## Function
CAVIN1, also known as caveolae associated protein 1, is essential for the formation and function of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane involved in various cellular processes. CAVIN1 acts as a scaffold protein, stabilizing the caveolar structure by associating with caveolins at the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the biogenesis of caveolae, as CAVIN1 is recruited to membrane domains containing phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, stabilizing the membrane curvature to form the characteristic flask shape of caveolae (Briand2011Cavin; Hill2008PTRFCavin).

CAVIN1 is involved in lipid metabolism, signal transduction, and endocytosis. It plays a role in regulating insulin signaling pathways, as evidenced by reduced insulin receptor activity and insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation in CAVIN1-deficient mice, which is associated with an insulin-resistant phenotype (Briand2011Cavin). CAVIN1 also influences muscle growth, with mutations leading to increased Akt phosphorylation and muscle hypertrophy (Briand2011Cavin).

CAVIN1 is active in various cell types, including adipocytes, where it is associated with lipid droplets, potentially influencing lipid storage and organization (Briand2011Cavin). Its presence is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and functional capabilities of caveolae, impacting cellular homeostasis and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAVIN1 gene, also known as caveolae associated protein 1, are linked to congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4 (CGL4), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a near-total absence of body fat, muscular dystrophy, and cardiac abnormalities such as arrhythmias and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Mancioppi2023A; Sorkina2020Unusual). Patients with CGL4 often exhibit metabolic complications, including insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperphagia, due to impaired feedback mechanisms between adipocytes and central feeding pathways (Mancioppi2023A).

CAVIN1 mutations also lead to a secondary deficiency of caveolins, which are crucial for muscle and adipose tissue function. This deficiency results in muscular dystrophy with generalized lipodystrophy, as seen in patients with elevated serum creatine kinase levels and muscle hypertrophy (Hayashi2009Human). The absence of caveolae in muscle tissues due to CAVIN1 mutations causes sarcolemmal instability, leading to muscle fibrosis and impaired regeneration (Ding2017Muscular).

In addition to muscular and metabolic symptoms, CAVIN1 mutations are associated with other clinical features such as myopathy, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and potential infertility (Sorkina2020Unusual; Patni2018Postmortem). These findings highlight the significant role of CAVIN1 in maintaining normal muscle and metabolic functions.

## Interactions
CAVIN1, also known as caveolae associated protein 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for the formation and function of caveolae. CAVIN1 interacts with Caveolin1 (CAV1), a key protein embedded in the plasma membrane, forming a stable complex that is crucial for caveolae formation. This interaction is facilitated by complementary electrostatic surfaces, where the negatively charged regions of CAVIN1 align with the positively charged regions of CAV1 (Wang2020Homotrimer; Tillu2021Cavin1). The intrinsically disordered regions (DR domains) of CAVIN1, particularly DR3, are essential for its association with CAV1, and mutations in these regions can disrupt caveola formation (Tillu2021Cavin1).

CAVIN1 also forms homotrimers that interact with CAV1, with the N-terminus of CAV1 fitting into the telechelic cavity of CAVIN1, stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds (Wang2020Homotrimer). Additionally, CAVIN1 interacts with other proteins such as EHD2 and Pacsin2, contributing to membrane curvature and caveolae dynamics (Tillu2021Cavin1). CAVIN1's interaction with CAV1 is also involved in the recruitment of CAVIN1 into extracellular vesicles, influencing cellular processes such as tumor growth and microglial activation (Wang2020Homotrimer).
