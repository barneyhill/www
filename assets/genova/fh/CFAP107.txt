# CFAP107

## Overview
CFAP107, or cilia and flagella associated protein 107, is a gene that encodes a microtubule inner protein (MIP) crucial for the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. The protein encoded by CFAP107 is integral to the stability of axonemal doublet microtubules, which are essential components of ciliary structures. It is specifically associated with the axonemal outer doublet lumen, where it interacts with tubulin subunits to maintain the heterotypic tubulin lattice interface, thereby contributing to the structural stability of the A-tubule wall (Andersen2024Uncovering). CFAP107 contains conserved Mn repeat units and an NWE motif, which are critical for its binding function within the microtubule lattice (Tai2023Incell). In sperm axonemes, CFAP107 interacts with proteins such as MNS1 and Tektin3-3, underscoring its role in maintaining the structural framework necessary for effective ciliary and flagellar function (Tai2023Incell).

## Function
CFAP107 is a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia in human cells. It is a microtubule inner protein (MIP) that plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the axonemal doublet microtubules, which are essential components of cilia. CFAP107 is associated with the axonemal outer doublet lumen, specifically at the seam of the structure, where it interacts with tubulin subunits to maintain the heterotypic tubulin lattice interface (Andersen2024Uncovering).

The protein contains conserved Mn repeat units and an NWE motif, which are critical for its binding between tubulin pairs in the microtubule lattice. These structural motifs are implicated in the protein's role in ciliary function, suggesting that CFAP107 contributes to the structural integrity and operation of cilia by stabilizing the A-tubule wall (Andersen2024Uncovering; Tai2023Incell).

In the context of sperm axonemes, CFAP107 interacts with other proteins such as MNS1 and Tektin3-3, contributing to the interlocking of junction sites and the overall stability of the doublet microtubule architecture (Tai2023Incell). These interactions highlight its importance in maintaining the structural framework necessary for effective ciliary and flagellar function.

## Interactions
CFAP107 is involved in several interactions that contribute to the structural integrity and function of cilia. It is part of the NWE module, which includes a conserved N-terminal NWE motif and two C-terminal Mn repeat units. This module is positioned at the seam protofilaments (A9-A10) in the axonemal doublet luminal niche, where it interacts with tubulin subunits. The NWE motif of CFAP107 makes specific contacts with the tubA subunit of A9 and forms hydrogen bonds with the tubB subunit of the neighboring A10 protofilament. These interactions suggest a role in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia by stabilizing the seam heterotypic tubulin lattice interface (Andersen2024Uncovering).

In the context of sperm microtubule doublets, CFAP107 interacts with MNS1, which is located between tubulin protofilaments A07-A08 and interacts with Tektin5-3. The junction site of two MNS1 proteins is interlocked by interactions with CFAP107 and CFAP151, which interacts with Tektin3-3. This network of interactions is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the doublet microtubule architecture, preventing it from tearing apart under stress (Tai2023Incell).
