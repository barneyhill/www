# CNTN2

## Overview
The CNTN2 gene encodes the protein contactin 2, a neuronal adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Contactin 2 is primarily involved in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in the organization and function of myelinated axons. It is characterized by its structure, which includes six immunoglobulin domains and four fibronectin type III domains, contributing to its function in cell adhesion and neural development (Kalafatakis2021Implication; Lu20183D). As a glycoprotein, contactin 2 is essential for axon outgrowth, pathfinding, and neuronal connectivity, and it forms complexes with other proteins such as contactin-associated protein 2 (Caspr2) and Shaker-type voltage-gated potassium channels, which are vital for the structural integrity of the juxtaparanodal regions in myelinated axons (Kalafatakis2021Implication). Mutations in the CNTN2 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including epilepsy and cerebral small vessel disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Abdulkareem2023Whole; Dunn2023Exonic).

## Structure
Contactin-2 (CNTN2) is a neuronal adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, which includes six immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains (Kalafatakis2021Implication; Lu20183D). The secondary structure of CNTN2 is characterized by these Ig and FNIII domains, which contribute to its role in cell adhesion and neural development (Lu20183D).

The tertiary structure of CNTN2 involves the folding of these domains into a dynamic and flexible configuration. The Ig1-Ig4 domains form a horseshoe-shaped headpiece, which can exist in equilibrium between open and closed states, allowing for a range of conformations (Lu20183D). This structural flexibility is crucial for its function in mediating cell-cell interactions in the nervous system (Lu20183D).

CNTN2 can form multimeric complexes, indicating a quaternary structure that involves interactions with other proteins, such as contactin-associated protein 2 (Caspr2) at axoglial junctions (Kalafatakis2021Implication; Lu20183D). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and affect its stability and function (Kalafatakis2021Implication).

## Function
Contactin-2 (CNTN2) is a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the organization and function of myelinated axons in the nervous system. It is predominantly expressed on axons and is involved in axon outgrowth, pathfinding, and neuronal connectivity (Kalafatakis2021Implication). CNTN2 is a component of the juxtaparanodal region in myelinated axons, where it forms a complex with contactin-associated protein 2 (Caspr2) and Shaker-type voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs). This complex is crucial for the structural integrity of the juxtaparanodal regions, which are adjacent to the paranodal junctions (Kalafatakis2021Implication).

CNTN2 interacts with other immunoglobulin superfamily members and acts as a ligand for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), impacting neurogenesis and axon guidance (Kalafatakis2021Implication). It is also involved in the regulation of ion channel clustering, which is essential for nerve signal transmission (Poliak2003Juxtaparanodal). In the cardiac conduction system, CNTN2 is expressed in Purkinje fibers, where it may play a role in the organization of ion channels and the patterning of the conduction system network (Pallante2010Contactin2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNTN2 gene, which encodes the neural cell adhesion molecule contactin 2, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. Notably, CNTN2 mutations are associated with various forms of epilepsy, including Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy 5 (FAME5), characterized by myoclonus and seizures. These mutations can lead to a range of symptoms such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures, focal-onset seizures, and developmental delays (Abdulkareem2023Whole). A specific missense mutation, c.1699G>T, resulting in p.Glu567Ter, has been identified in consanguineous families with epilepsy, suggesting a loss of normal protein function through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Abdulkareem2023Whole).

CNTN2 is also linked to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and CADASIL-related pathologies, where mutations may contribute to the disease's phenotypic spectrum, including seizures and cognitive deficits (Dunn2023Exonic). Additionally, a frameshift variant in CNTN2, due to maternal uniparental disomy, has been associated with generalized seizures evolving into focal seizures, cognitive and behavioral deficits, and emotional regulation problems (Chen2021Case).

The gene's interaction with the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) suggests a potential role in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, although direct causation has not been conclusively established (Dunn2023Exonic).

## Interactions
Contactin 2 (CNTN2) is a neuronal adhesion molecule that participates in several critical protein-protein interactions. It forms a specific and high-affinity complex with contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), which is essential for stabilizing synaptic and axo-glial contacts. This interaction occurs with low nanomolar affinity and involves CNTN2 binding to CNTNAP2 in a side-by-side complex, tethered to the axonal membrane and reaching across the extracellular space to bind a second CNTN2 molecule on the opposing glial membrane (Lu2016Molecular).

CNTN2 also interacts with Caspr2, forming a neuron-glia cell adhesion complex crucial for the clustering of voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) in myelinated axon membranes. This complex facilitates rapid action potential propagation and is implicated in the organization of the juxtaparanodal region in myelinated fibers (Kalafatakis2021Implication; Chen2015Interaction).

Additionally, CNTN2 can form homomers and recruit different protein partners to neuronal and axoglial contact points. It interacts with other immunoglobulin superfamily members, such as L1 and NrCAM, and acts as a ligand for APP, impacting neurogenesis (Kalafatakis2021Implication; Lu20183D). These interactions highlight CNTN2's role in mediating cell-cell interactions and maintaining neural connectivity.
