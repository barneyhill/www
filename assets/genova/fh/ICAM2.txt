# ICAM2

## Overview
ICAM2, or intercellular adhesion molecule 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes and plays a significant role in the immune system by facilitating leukocyte transmigration across endothelial barriers. ICAM2 is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and various leukocytes, including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets, and is involved in interactions with integrins such as LFA-1 and MAC-1, which are crucial for immune surveillance and response (de1991Characterization). Unlike its homolog ICAM1, ICAM2 is not upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, indicating its role in maintaining steady-state immune functions rather than responding to acute inflammation (Lehmann2003Overlapping). Additionally, ICAM2 is implicated in the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for cell survival and apoptosis inhibition (Perez2002Activation). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as α-actinin and DC-SIGN, further underscore its importance in cellular adhesion and immune cell trafficking (Heiska1996Binding; Geijtenbeek2000DCSIGN–ICAM2).

## Structure
ICAM2 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its structural components, which include two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Diacovo1994A). The extracellular region of ICAM2 is involved in cell adhesion and interaction with integrins, such as LFA-1, which is crucial for leukocyte transmigration (Diacovo1994A).

The cytoplasmic domain of ICAM2, particularly amino acids 241-248, is critical for binding to α-actinin, a cytoskeletal protein. This interaction is important for linking ICAM2 to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating cellular adhesion and migration (Heiska1996Binding). The binding site in ICAM2 is composed of both hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids, which are conserved between species, indicating their functional importance (Heiska1996Binding).

ICAM2 does not have a stable conformation in its cytoplasmic domain, allowing it to interact with various cytoplasmic proteins (Heiska1996Binding). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Diacovo1994A). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ICAM2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ICAM-2 (intercellular adhesion molecule 2) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to cell adhesion and immune response. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and certain leukocytes, including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets (de1991Characterization). ICAM-2 plays a significant role in leukocyte endothelial transmigration, facilitating the movement of immune cells across the endothelium, which is crucial for immune surveillance and response (Huang2006ICAM2).

ICAM-2 interacts with integrins such as LFA-1 and MAC-1, which are expressed on leukocytes, to mediate cell adhesion processes essential for immune functions like antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation (de1991Characterization). Unlike ICAM-1, ICAM-2 is not upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, suggesting its role in steady-state lymphocyte recirculation rather than acute inflammatory responses (de1991Characterization; Lehmann2003Overlapping).

ICAM-2 is also involved in the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and the inhibition of apoptosis. This pathway's activation leads to the phosphorylation of targets such as BAD, GSK3, and FKHR, thereby protecting cells from apoptosis (Perez2002Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ICAM2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In allergic lung diseases, such as asthma, ICAM2 plays a crucial role in eosinophil trafficking. ICAM2-deficient mice exhibit prolonged eosinophil accumulation in the lung interstitium, leading to extended airway hyperresponsiveness, a hallmark of asthma (Gerwin1999Prolonged).

In coronary artery disease (CAD), ICAM2 expression is increased in atherosclerotic arteries, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory processes that contribute to atherogenesis. The upregulation of ICAM2 in CAD tissues indicates its role in endothelial cell function and inflammation (Archacki2003Identification).

ICAM2 is also associated with cancer, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Overexpression of ICAM2 and other endothelial adhesion molecules is linked to altered immune cell infiltration, potentially affecting immune response and resistance to immunotherapy (Chae2018Overexpression).

In inflammatory lung diseases like cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ICAM2 expression is upregulated on the bronchial epithelium, although its role in neutrophil migration remains unclear (Chong2021ICAM1).

## Interactions
ICAM-2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular adhesion and signaling. It binds to α-actinin, an actin-binding protein, through its cytoplasmic domain. This interaction is specific and involves the amino acids 241-248 of ICAM-2, which are highly conserved and include both hydrophobic and positively charged residues. The binding of α-actinin to ICAM-2 is essential for linking cell surface adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell morphology and migration (Heiska1996Binding).

ICAM-2 also interacts with the DC-specific adhesion receptor DC-SIGN, facilitating dendritic cell trafficking. This interaction supports the tethering and rolling of dendritic cells on the vascular endothelium, which is crucial for their migration under shear flow conditions. The binding affinity of DC-SIGN for ICAM-2 is higher than for ICAM-3, highlighting its significance in dendritic cell migration (Geijtenbeek2000DCSIGN–ICAM2).

Additionally, ICAM-2 is involved in activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which inhibits apoptosis. This pathway involves interactions with proteins such as ezrin, PDK-1, and AKT, contributing to cell survival signaling (Perez2002Activation).
