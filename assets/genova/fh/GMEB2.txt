# GMEB2

## Overview
GMEB2, or glucocorticoid modulatory element binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity. The protein product of GMEB2 is a part of the glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding complex, which plays a critical role in modulating gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences known as glucocorticoid modulatory elements (GME) (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). GMEB2 is characterized by its ability to form both homooligomers and heterooligomers with GMEB1, which are essential for its DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory functions (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). The protein contains a SAND domain, which is crucial for DNA binding, and interacts with various proteins, including transcriptional cofactors like CBP and Ubc9, to influence transcriptional regulation (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). GMEB2 has been implicated in several cellular processes and diseases, including its role in colorectal cancer and glioma, where it affects tumor growth and progression (EckelPassow2020Abstract; Ning2022GMEB2).

## Structure
The GMEB2 protein is part of the glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding complex and is involved in transcriptional regulation. It forms a heterooligomer with GMEB-1, and both proteins share a similar domain organization despite only 39% amino acid sequence identity (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). GMEB2 contains a SAND domain, which is approximately 80 amino acids long, and is involved in DNA binding (Chen2003StructureActivity). The DNA-binding activity of GMEB2 requires the KDWK motif, and a double point mutation in this motif eliminates DNA-binding activity (Chen2003StructureActivity).

The protein's intrinsic transactivation activity is localized to a small sequence of 58 amino acids at the N-terminus (Chen2003StructureActivity). GMEB2 also interacts with other proteins, such as the C-terminus of CBP and Ubc9, although the binding domains for Ubc9 are not consistently patterned (Chen2003StructureActivity). Several splice variant isoforms of GMEB2, including GMEB-2', GMEB-2a, and GMEB-2b, result from alternative splicing events, leading to differences in protein sequence and function (Zeng2000Genomic). The apparent molecular mass of GMEB2 on SDS gels is 67 kDa, compared to a calculated mass of 56.5 kDa, suggesting contributions from specific regions that affect its migration (Chen2003StructureActivity).

## Function
GMEB2 (glucocorticoid modulatory element binding protein 2) is a transcription factor involved in modulating the activity of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in human cells. It is part of the glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding complex and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences known as glucocorticoid modulatory elements (GME) (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). GMEB2 can form both homooligomers and heterooligomers with GMEB1, which are essential for its DNA-binding capability and modulation of GR transcriptional properties (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties).

In the nucleus, GMEB2 interacts with other proteins, such as the transcriptional cofactor CBP, to influence transcriptional regulation (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). It modulates the dose-response curve of GR-agonist complexes and decreases the partial agonist activity of GR-antagonist complexes, impacting the sensitivity and activity of glucocorticoid hormones (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). These interactions suggest that GMEB2 plays a significant role in cellular functions and organismal homeostasis by affecting GR-mediated transcriptional regulation (Kaul2000Properties).

## Clinical Significance
GMEB2 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). It is highly expressed in CRC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, promoting cancer growth by activating ADRM1 transcription and NF-κB signaling pathways. This overexpression is linked to increased CRC cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting that GMEB2 plays a crucial role in tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo (Ning2022GMEB2). The m6A reader YTHDF1 enhances the stability of GMEB2 mRNA, further contributing to its upregulation in CRC (Ning2022GMEB2). 

In addition to its role in CRC, GMEB2 has been associated with adult diffuse glioma. A genome-wide association study identified significant genetic variants in or near GMEB2 that are linked to specific glioma subtypes, particularly IDH wild-type glioma. The most significant variant, rs4809313, suggests a potential genetic predisposition to glioma involving GMEB2 (EckelPassow2020Abstract). These findings indicate that alterations in GMEB2 expression or genetic variants can contribute to the development and progression of certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GMEB2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms a heterooligomeric complex with GMEB1, which binds to the glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene, influencing the gene's sensitivity to glucocorticoids (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties). GMEB2 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), modulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction affects the dose-response curve and partial agonist activity of GR complexes (Chen2003StructureActivity; Kaul2000Properties).

The DNA-binding activity of GMEB2 is dependent on the KDWK sequence, which is essential for its interaction with DNA, specifically a GME oligonucleotide (Chen2003StructureActivity). GMEB2 also interacts with the transcriptional cofactor CBP, with stronger interactions observed compared to GMEB1 (Chen2003StructureActivity). Additionally, GMEB2 binds to Ubc9, a human homologue of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, although this interaction is weaker than that of GMEB1 (Chen2003StructureActivity).

In colorectal cancer, GMEB2 acts as a transcription factor to activate the ADRM1/NF-κB signaling pathway, contributing to cancer growth (Ning2022GMEB2). It binds to a specific site on the ADRM1 promoter to regulate its transcription (Ning2022GMEB2).
