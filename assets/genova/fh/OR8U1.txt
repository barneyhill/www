# OR8U1

## Overview
The OR8U1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily U member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a pivotal role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. Characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, OR8U1 shares this feature with many other neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, underscoring its role as a transmembrane receptor (Salas2017Whole; Yin2020Functional). Beyond its established function in olfaction, OR8U1 and other olfactory receptors have been implicated in non-olfactory roles, such as regulating macrophage function in pulmonary tissues, suggesting potential involvement in broader physiological processes and disease mechanisms (Salas2017Whole).

## Function
The OR8U1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, which is shared with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. OR8U1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell (Salas2017Whole; Yin2020Functional).

In addition to its role in olfaction, there is emerging evidence that olfactory receptors, including OR8U1, may have functions beyond the olfactory system. These receptors have been found to express in non-olfactory tissues, such as pulmonary macrophages, where they might regulate macrophage function. This suggests a broader role for OR8U1 in physiological processes, potentially contributing to the progression of chronic inflammatory airway diseases (Salas2017Whole). However, specific details about the function of OR8U1 in healthy human cells outside the olfactory system remain to be fully elucidated (Yin2020Functional; Salas2017Whole).
