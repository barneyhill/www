# CALHM1

## Overview
CALHM1 (calcium homeostasis modulator 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and neuronal excitability. The protein, also named CALHM1, functions as a voltage-gated ion channel and is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and intracellular N- and C-termini. It forms octameric structures with a large ion-conducting pore, facilitating the passage of ions such as Ca²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻, as well as small molecules like ATP (Jin2021A; Kelly2014Mechanisms). CALHM1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and taste bud cells, where it plays a critical role in modulating neuronal excitability and taste perception (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3; Ma2012Calcium). The gene has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, due to its involvement in calcium signaling and amyloid-beta metabolism (DresesWerringloer2008A).

## Structure
CALHM1 (calcium homeostasis modulator 1) is a transmembrane protein characterized by four transmembrane domains and intracellular N- and C-termini (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3; Kelly2014Mechanisms). The protein forms octameric structures, contributing to its quaternary structure, and exhibits noncanonical helical packing (Jin2021A). CALHM1 channels have a large ion-conducting pore with a diameter of approximately 14 Å, which is significant for its function in voltage-gated ATP release (Kelly2014Mechanisms).

The protein is N-glycosylated on its second extracellular loop, a post-translational modification that may influence its function (Kelly2014Mechanisms). CALHM1 is expressed in various polarized cells, including taste bud cells, where it forms a hetero-hexameric complex with CALHM3, facilitating ATP release (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). The protein's localization is influenced by specific sorting motifs, such as a dileucine motif in the loop and a tyrosine-based motif in the C-terminal region, which are crucial for its basolateral sorting in epithelial cells (Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3). These structural features and modifications are essential for CALHM1's role in cellular signaling and homeostasis.

## Function
CALHM1 encodes a protein that functions as a voltage-gated ion channel involved in calcium homeostasis and neuronal excitability. In healthy human cells, CALHM1 forms a hexameric channel that is permeable to ions such as Ca²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻, as well as small molecules like ATP (Ma2015Calcium; Syrjänen2023Structure). The channel is regulated by membrane voltage and extracellular calcium concentration, with reduced extracellular calcium increasing the channel's open probability (Ma2015Calcium; Ma2012Calcium).

CALHM1 is expressed in the brain, particularly in cortical and hippocampal neurons, where it modulates neuronal excitability by responding to changes in extracellular calcium levels. This modulation is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis and influencing action potential firing (Ma2012Calcium). In type II taste bud cells, CALHM1 facilitates ATP release, which is essential for taste perception, particularly for sweet, umami, and bitter tastes (Ma2015Calcium; Kashio2019CALHM1CALHM3).

The channel's structure includes four transmembrane helices, and its function is influenced by specific residues that modulate calcium sensitivity and ion permeability (Syrjänen2023Structure). CALHM1's role in neuronal and gustatory signaling highlights its importance in both cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CALHM1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). The CALHM1 gene encodes a calcium channel that regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis and amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide metabolism, both of which are crucial in AD pathogenesis (DresesWerringloer2008A). The P86L polymorphism in CALHM1 has been associated with an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and is linked to an earlier age of onset in some populations (Boada2010CALHM1; Cui2010CALHM1). This polymorphism may modulate Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid, particularly in cognitively healthy individuals at risk for AD, although its role as an independent risk factor remains uncertain (Koppel2011CALHM1).

Other variants, such as R154H, have been associated with defects in calcium homeostasis and Aβ metabolism, potentially contributing to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) (Vingtdeux2014Effect; RubioMoscardo2013Rare). The CALHM1 gene has also been linked to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), with certain polymorphisms showing marginal associations with disease risk (Calero2012Genetic). These findings suggest that genetic variability in CALHM1 may influence the risk and progression of neurodegenerative diseases through its impact on calcium signaling and Aβ regulation.

## Interactions
CALHM1 interacts with members of the DHHC palmitoyl transferase (PAT) family, specifically DHHC3, DHHC7, and DHHC20, which are involved in its palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that affects its function. DHHC3 and DHHC20 are identified as the primary PATs responsible for CALHM1 palmitoylation in N2a cells, as their knockdown significantly reduces palmitoylation levels. Although DHHC7 also interacts with CALHM1, its knockdown does not significantly affect palmitoylation, suggesting a lesser role (Taruno2017Post‐translational). These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Taruno2017Post‐translational).

Palmitoylation of CALHM1 influences its association with lipid rafts, as demonstrated by its increased affinity for detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) when palmitoylated. This association is independent of its cell surface expression (Taruno2017Post‐translational). The interaction with lipid raft-associated proteins, such as flotillin-1, is implied but not explicitly detailed (Taruno2017Post‐translational). The structural analysis of CALHM1 does not provide specific information on direct interactions with nucleic acids, but it suggests that palmitoylation could affect such interactions by altering CALHM1's localization and activity (Taruno2017Post‐translational).
