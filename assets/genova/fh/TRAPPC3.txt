# TRAPPC3

## Overview
TRAPPC3 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 3, which is a critical component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex. This protein is involved in vesicle-mediated transport, particularly in the early secretory pathway, facilitating the movement of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), TRAPPC3 interacts with Rab GTPases, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of vesicle tethering and fusion. The protein's structure, characterized by α-helices and β-sheets, allows it to form homodimers and interact with other TRAPP subunits, such as TRAPPC1, TRAPPC4, TRAPPC5, and TRAPPC6A, underscoring its central role in the complex's architecture and function (Brunet2014In; Jenkins2020The; Tran2024The).

## Structure
TRAPPC3 is a subunit of the TRAPP complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport. The primary structure of TRAPPC3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a core component of the TRAPP I, II, and III complexes (Brunet2014In; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The secondary structure of TRAPPC3 is characterized by the presence of α-helices and β-sheets, forming a stable core shared among the TRAPP complexes (Tran2024The). 

The tertiary structure of TRAPPC3 involves a homodimeric configuration, with the architecture forming two layers consisting of four α-helices and a four-stranded β-sheet. The N-terminal helices are crucial for the dimerization interface (Tran2024The). This structure is similar to the eukaryotic TRAPPC3/C6 heterodimer, indicating evolutionary conservation (Tran2024The).

In terms of quaternary structure, TRAPPC3 interacts with multiple other subunits within the TRAPP core, such as TRAPPC1, TRAPPC4, TRAPPC5, and TRAPPC6A, suggesting its central role in the complex's architecture (Jenkins2020The). The protein also contains internal cavities that may bind small molecules, indicating a potential role in ligand transport (Tran2024The). 

TRAPPC3 is involved in interactions with Rab GTPases, which are essential for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in vesicle trafficking (Jenkins2020The). The presence of Zn²⁺ binding through cysteine residues is similar to other ligand-binding proteins, suggesting a conserved functional mechanism (Tran2024The).

## Function
TRAPPC3, a subunit of the TRAPP complex, plays a critical role in vesicle-mediated transport within cells, particularly in the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It is part of the TRAPP I core complex, which is involved in the initial stages of vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Brunet2014In). TRAPPC3 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab1, a small GTPase, facilitating its activation. This activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the early secretory pathway, which includes processes like protein sorting and secretion (Brunet2014In).

TRAPPC3 is also involved in COPII vesicle tethering, a process essential for ER-to-Golgi traffic. Neutralizing antibodies specific to TRAPPC3 have been shown to block ER-to-Golgi traffic in vivo and homotypic COPII vesicle tethering in vitro, highlighting its role in these processes (Zhao2017Mammalian). Additionally, TRAPPC3 forms heterodimers with TRAPPC6A1 and TRAPPC6B, which are involved in forming larger TRAPP complexes, indicating its structural and functional importance in maintaining cellular organization (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These functions underscore TRAPPC3's essential role in maintaining proper cellular function and organization.

## Interactions
TRAPPC3 is a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle-mediated transport. Within the TRAPP complex, TRAPPC3 interacts with several other subunits, including TRAPPC1, TRAPPC5, and TRAPPC6A, forming part of the TRAPP core. These interactions have been mapped using chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry, highlighting TRAPPC3's position within the complex (Jenkins2020The). TRAPPC3 also forms a heterodimer with TRAPPC6A1, which occupies a larger surface area compared to the TRAPPC6B-TRAPPC3 heterodimer. This heterodimer can further interact with TRAPPC1 to form heterotrimeric complexes, suggesting a network of interactions within the TRAPP complexes (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC3 is involved in interactions with proteins that facilitate membrane trafficking, such as Rab GTPases. It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab1, Rab11, Rab19, and Rab43, which are crucial for various trafficking steps, including Golgi traffic and post-Golgi traffic (Jenkins2020The). These interactions underscore TRAPPC3's role in the regulation of vesicle tethering and fusion, contributing to its function in cellular transport processes (Brunet2014In).
