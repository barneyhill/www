# HOXB5

## Overview
The HOXB5 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the homeodomain. The protein encoded by HOXB5, homeobox B5, plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation and patterning of the respiratory system. As a transcription factor, homeobox B5 is involved in the precise control of developmental processes, including lung morphogenesis and airway branching. Its expression is tightly regulated, with significant activity during early developmental stages, and it is implicated in various pathological conditions when dysregulated. Notably, aberrant expression of HOXB5 is associated with congenital lung malformations and certain cancers, where it influences cell differentiation and tissue patterning through interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Chen2021The; Volpe2003Expression).

## Structure
The HOXB5 protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain (HD), a 60-amino acid helix-turn-helix structure crucial for DNA binding. This domain is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding but not for cooperative binding, which requires additional sequences adjacent to the homeodomain (Galang1993Cooperative). The protein contains a single cysteine residue, Cys-232, located within the homeodomain, which plays a critical role in redox regulation and cooperative DNA binding. This cysteine is involved in forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, leading to dimerization, although these dimers alone are not sufficient for cooperative binding (Galang1993Cooperative).

The N-terminal extension to the homeodomain is necessary for cooperative stabilization of DNA binding. Specific sequences in this region, such as (M)LHISHDMTGPD, are crucial for this function (Galang1993Cooperative). The protein can form noncovalent dimers in the absence of DNA, and these dimers are not prevented by the replacement of Cys-232, indicating that more than simple dimerization is required for cooperative binding (Galang1993Cooperative).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity and specificity of HOX proteins, including HOXB5, although specific modifications for HOXB5 are not well-characterized (Draime2018Posttranslational).

## Function
HOXB5 is a homeobox gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. It plays a critical role in lung development, particularly in airway branching morphogenesis. During the pseudoglandular stage of lung development, HOXB5 is highly expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the branching airways, facilitating bronchiolar pattern formation. Its expression decreases during the canalicular stage and becomes negligible by the alveolar stage, indicating its primary involvement in early airway branching and bronchiolar patterning (Volpe2003Expression).

HOXB5 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the expression of target genes, influencing cell differentiation and tissue patterning. This gene is essential for normal airway branching morphogenesis, and its expression is tightly regulated during different phases of lung development (Volpe2000Association; Volpe2003Expression). The protein's activity is crucial for the orderly development of the respiratory system, and its misexpression is associated with congenital lung malformations such as bronchopulmonary sequestration and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, where it remains abnormally elevated (Volpe2003Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXB5 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HOXB5 is upregulated and serves as a prognostic marker. High expression levels are associated with poor prognosis, particularly in patients with normal karyotype or specific mutations such as DNMT3A, FLT3, and NPM1. These mutations correlate with higher HOXB5 expression, and patients with triple mutations (FND) exhibit a distinct AML subset with adverse outcomes (Chen2021The). HOXB5 is also involved in the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway, influencing myeloid cell differentiation and leukemia stem cell functions (Chen2021The).

In the context of congenital lung malformations, HOXB5 is abnormally expressed in conditions like bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM). These malformations are characterized by abnormal airway development, with HOXB5 expression remaining elevated, similar to earlier developmental stages, suggesting its role in these conditions (Volpe2003Expression).

HOXB5 is also noted for its role in cancer progression, such as in gastric tumors, where it activates Wnt signaling, promoting invasion and metastasis (Bondos2020Contextdependent).

## Interactions
HOXB5 is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. One notable interaction is with the NKX2-1 protein, where HOXB5 and NKX2-1 form a protein complex that binds to the RET gene promoter. This interaction synergistically enhances the trans-activation of the RET promoter, crucial for the development of the enteric nervous system. The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RET promoter can reduce the synergistic effect of HOXB5 and NKX2-1, although these SNPs do not affect HOXB5's activity alone (Zhu2011HOXB5).

HOXB5 also interacts with the CTNNB1 promoter in gastric carcinoma cells, directly binding to specific promoter regions to up-regulate β-catenin expression. This interaction influences cell invasion and migration through the β-catenin-TCF-LEF signaling pathway, highlighting HOXB5's role in cancer progression (Hong2015HOXB5).

Additionally, HOXB5 exhibits cooperative DNA binding, which is regulated by redox conditions. This cooperative binding requires a cysteine residue in the homeodomain, and the presence of reducing agents can block this cooperative interaction, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism (Galang1993Cooperative).
