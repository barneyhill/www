# FOXN4

## Overview
FOXN4 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box N4 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the development of the retina and spinal cord by regulating the differentiation and specification of various cell types. In the retina, forkhead box N4 is essential for the generation of amacrine and horizontal cells, while in the spinal cord, it is involved in the specification of V2b interneurons through the activation of the Dll4-Notch signaling pathway (Liu2020Foxn4; Misra2014Asymmetric). The protein's ability to interact with other transcription factors and signaling pathways underscores its importance in maintaining the balance of cell types during development (Luo2012Forkhead).

## Structure


## Function
FOXN4 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development of the retina and spinal cord by influencing the differentiation and specification of various cell types. In the retina, FOXN4 acts as a temporal identity factor, conferring mid/late-early competence to retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). It is crucial for the generation of amacrine and horizontal cells while suppressing the differentiation of immediate-early cell types like retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (Liu2020Foxn4). FOXN4 achieves this by activating the expression of transcription factors such as Ptf1a, which suppresses RGC specification and differentiation (Liu2020Foxn4). It also indirectly regulates photoreceptor transcription factors by activating Otx2, contributing to retinal synaptogenesis and long-term maintenance (Liu2020Foxn4).

In the spinal cord, FOXN4 is involved in the specification of V2b interneurons from a common progenitor pool. It operates through the activation of Dll4-Notch signaling, which is essential for the differentiation of V2b interneurons (Misra2014Asymmetric). FOXN4, in conjunction with proneural factors like Ascl1, activates the Dll4 enhancer, leading to the specification of V2b interneurons and maintaining the balance between V2a and V2b cell types (Misra2014Asymmetric; Li2005Foxn4).

## Interactions
FOXN4 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in retinal development by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It directly activates the expression of Dll4, a component of the Notch signaling pathway, through conserved enhancer regions containing specific ACGC motifs. This interaction is crucial for modulating the fate and proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, as Dll4-Notch signaling suppresses photoreceptor cell fates in early retinal progenitors (Luo2012Forkhead).

FOXN4 also influences the expression of several transcription factors, such as Otx2, Crx, Nrl, Nr2e3, Prdm1, and Rxrg, which are essential for photoreceptor cell specification and differentiation. It is suggested that FOXN4 may activate Otx2 expression in retinal progenitor cells, as indicated by the colocalization of FOXN4 and Otx2 in a subpopulation of these cells (Liu2020Foxn4).

The activation domain (AD) of FOXN4, located between amino acids 402 and 455, is critical for its transcriptional regulatory functions. This domain is necessary for the upregulation or repression of specific genes involved in retinogenesis, such as NeuroAB, Prox1, Lim1, Ptf1a, Otx2, Nr2e3, and RaxL (Lelièvre2011A).
