# ZBTB37

## Overview
ZBTB37 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 37, which is a member of the BTB-ZF (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric Ã  brac-Zinc Finger) family of transcriptional regulators. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, and multiple zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. The zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 37 is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, although its specific biological roles remain to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential involvement in the regulation of gene expression and their possible implications in human diseases.
