# OR8A1

## Overview
The OR8A1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily A member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odorants and plays a critical role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. Structurally, OR8A1 is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, facilitating its function as a receptor on the cell membrane. Beyond its role in olfaction, OR8A1 is expressed in various brain regions, indicating potential involvement in broader physiological processes. Clinically, OR8A1 has been implicated in cancer progression and has been identified as a factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Biering2021Genomewide; Santos2019The; Man2004Prediction).

## Structure
The OR8A1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. These receptors typically have a primary structure consisting of amino acid sequences that form the basis for their function. The secondary structure of OR8A1 includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains (Santos2019The).

The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, creating a pocket-like region that is crucial for ligand binding. This structural feature is similar to other rhodopsin-like GPCRs, where the binding site residues are located primarily in the transmembrane helices 2 to 7 and the second extracellular loop (Man2004Prediction). The quaternary structure is generally not applicable to OR8A1, as these receptors function as monomers.

Common post-translational modifications for olfactory receptors like OR8A1 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence receptor function and stability (Santos2019The). The OR8A1 protein's structure is crucial for its role in detecting odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways.

## Function
OR8A1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odorants. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in signal transduction processes. In healthy human cells, OR8A1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odor molecules. Upon binding an odorant, OR8A1 initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell, contributing to the organism's ability to detect and differentiate a wide range of chemical compounds (Man2004Prediction).

The protein encoded by OR8A1 is involved in the molecular processes of odorant recognition and signal transduction. It is located on the cell membrane, where it interacts with odorant molecules in the extracellular environment. This interaction triggers a conformational change in the receptor, activating an associated G-protein. The activated G-protein then initiates a cascade of intracellular events, ultimately leading to neuronal responses that are interpreted by the brain as distinct smells (Man2004Prediction).

OR8A1's function is not limited to the olfactory system; it is also expressed in various brain regions, suggesting potential roles in detecting endogenous and exogenous ligands that may influence brain functions (Santos2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The OR8A1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts. In the realm of cancer research, OR8A1 has been identified as a gene involved in invasion and metastasis processes across multiple cancer types. A study developed a risk scoring system using gene expression levels, which showed that combinations of certain genes, including OR8A1, improved prognostic risk stratification for cancer patients (Li2022PanCancer). Additionally, OR8A1 was associated with better prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression and patient outcomes (Ding2020Discovery).

In the context of infectious diseases, OR8A1 has been identified as a SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor in a gain-of-function screen. This suggests a potential antiviral role for OR8A1, as it is involved in smell and taste signaling, which are often affected in COVID-19 patients (Biering2021Genomewide). The study highlights the downregulation of olfactory receptors, including OR8A1, in the olfactory epithelium following SARS-CoV-2 infection, linking it to COVID-19 symptoms such as anosmia (Biering2021Genomewide). These findings underscore the gene's significance in both cancer and viral infection contexts.
