# CERS6

## Overview
CERS6, or ceramide synthase 6, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of ceramides, which are critical components of cell membranes and play pivotal roles in cellular signaling pathways. The CERS6 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes seven transmembrane helices and forms a homodimer, facilitating its function in the endoplasmic reticulum where it catalyzes the formation of ceramides by linking fatty acids to sphingosine (Raichur2020Ceramide; Pascoa2023Structural). This enzyme is particularly important in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular stress responses, influencing processes such as mitochondrial function and insulin resistance (Raichur2020Ceramide; Mullen2012Ceramide). Alterations in CERS6 expression have been associated with various cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it contributes to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance (Qi2021AKT1FOXP3; Suzuki2015Targeting). As such, CERS6 is considered a potential therapeutic target in oncology.

## Structure
The CERS6 protein is characterized by a structure that includes seven transmembrane helices, forming a homodimer. Each monomer contributes to a barrel structure composed of helices TM2-7, arranged as two inverted 3-TM units. This configuration creates a central cavity that is open to the cytoplasm but closed to the ER lumen, facilitating substrate recognition through a conserved architecture similar to other acyl-CoA-modifying enzymes (Pascoa2023Structural). The dimer interface is formed by TM1a, the C-terminal end of TM3, and the TM3-TM4 loop (Pascoa2023Structural).

The protein contains a TRAM-Lag1-CLN8 (TLC) homology domain, which includes a 52-residue Lag1p motif with conserved histidines and aspartates essential for its enzymatic activity (Pascoa2023Structural). A Hox-like domain is also present, though it is less well-defined in structural studies (Pascoa2023Structural).

Post-translational modifications of CERS6 include acetylation of the N-terminus and N-linked glycosylation, with the major glycosylation species containing a complete core N-linked glycan. Palmitoylation at a single site is also observed, corresponding to a covalent acyl-imidazole intermediate (Pascoa2023Structural). The protein is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and localization.

## Function
CERS6, or ceramide synthase 6, is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of ceramides, which are essential components of cell membranes and play significant roles in cellular signaling. CERS6 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the formation of ceramides by linking fatty acids, specifically preferring C14-C16 fatty acyl CoA, to sphingosine (Raichur2020Ceramide; Mizutani2005Mammalian). This enzyme is involved in both the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathway of ceramide production, contributing to the diversity of sphingolipids in cells (Raichur2020Ceramide).

In healthy human cells, CERS6 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. It is involved in the generation of C16-ceramide, which plays a role in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, a critical step in apoptosis (Mullen2012Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). CERS6 also influences cellular stress responses and lipid metabolism, impacting processes such as insulin resistance and mitochondrial function (Raichur2020Ceramide). The enzyme's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may affect its function and interactions within the cell (Park2014Ceramide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CERS6 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In NSCLC, CERS6 is overexpressed compared to normal lung tissues, and this overexpression is associated with increased invasiveness and poor prognosis. The elevated levels of CERS6 are partly due to the downregulation of microRNA-101, which normally targets CERS6 for degradation. This dysregulation promotes metastasis by enhancing cell migration and invasion through the formation of lamellipodia, structures critical for cell movement (Suzuki2019Targeting; Suzuki2015Targeting).

In PDAC, CERS6 expression is upregulated, particularly in the context of mutant p53, and is linked to aggressive tumor behavior. The AKT1/FOXP3 axis has been identified as a regulatory pathway that increases CERS6 expression, contributing to tumorigenesis. High levels of CERS6 correlate with poor prognosis and advanced stages of PDAC (Qi2021AKT1FOXP3).

CERS6 is also involved in chemotherapy resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by interfering with the Fas-FADD apoptotic pathway, thereby conferring resistance to treatment (Verlekar2018Ceramide). These findings suggest that CERS6 is a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
CERS6 (ceramide synthase 6) is known to participate in several physical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of apoptosis and chemotherapy resistance. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), CERS6 interacts with the CD95/Fas death receptor. This interaction occurs at the intracellular domains of Fas, specifically between amino acids 174 to 314, which includes the transmembrane domain to the death domain. By binding to Fas, CERS6 inhibits the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), thereby blocking the activation of caspase-8 and subsequent apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway (Verlekar2018Ceramide).

CERS6's interaction with Fas also interferes with the association of Fas with FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain), which is crucial for DISC assembly. This interference is evidenced by higher levels of FADD associated with Fas in CERS6 knockdown cells compared to control cells upon treatment with the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 (Verlekar2018Ceramide).

Additionally, CERS6 has been implicated in forming potential heterocomplexes with other ceramide synthases, such as CerS2 and CerS5, in HeLa cells, suggesting a role in the regulation of ceramide synthesis and apoptosis (Mesicek2010Ceramide).
