# FBXO28

## Overview
FBXO28 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 28, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein functions primarily as a substrate receptor, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiao2023FBXO28). F-box protein 28 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, transcriptional activation, and DNA topology resolution, through interactions with proteins such as MYC, BRD4, and topoisomerase IIα (Gorrepati2018An; Lv2024FBXO28). Its activity is predominantly nuclear, aligning with its roles in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control (Qiao2023FBXO28). The gene's involvement in diverse cellular contexts and its implications in diseases such as cancer and developmental disorders underscore its biological significance.

## Function
FBXO28 is a member of the F-box protein family, which functions as a substrate receptor within the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, responsible for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiao2023FBXO28). In healthy human cells, FBXO28 is involved in cell cycle regulation and is essential for proper mitotic progression. It achieves this through non-proteolytic ubiquitination of MYC, a transcription factor, which is crucial for MYC-dependent transcription and cell proliferation (Gorrepati2018An).

FBXO28 also interacts with topoisomerase IIα, an enzyme involved in resolving DNA topological issues during cell division, further underscoring its role in cell cycle progression (Gorrepati2018An). Additionally, FBXO28 is implicated in the regulation of transcriptional processes by interacting with BRD4, a transcriptional and epigenetic regulator, enhancing its function through ubiquitination (Lv2024FBXO28). This interaction promotes transcriptional activation, which is vital for cell proliferation and stability. FBXO28's activity is primarily nuclear, aligning with its roles in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control (Qiao2023FBXO28).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBXO28 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, FBXO28 is identified as a candidate gene contributing to intellectual disability and seizures. Patients with deletions encompassing FBXO28 often present with these symptoms, although the gene does not account for all features of the syndrome (Au2013Refinement). FBXO28-encephalopathy, characterized by developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) with profound intellectual disability, is linked to pathogenic variants in FBXO28. Truncating variants result in a more severe phenotype, including early-onset seizures and profound intellectual disability, compared to missense variants (Schneider2020FBXO28).

In cancer, FBXO28 plays a role in tumor progression. In ovarian cancer, FBXO28 is overexpressed and promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, correlating with poor prognosis (Song2024FBXO28). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, FBXO28 acts as a suppressor of invasion and metastasis by promoting the degradation of SNAI2, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target (Qiao2023FBXO28). These findings highlight the diverse roles of FBXO28 in different pathological contexts.

## Interactions
FBXO28 is an F-box protein that functions as a substrate receptor in the SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. FBXO28 directly binds to SNAI2, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), targeting it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction is crucial for suppressing migration, invasion, and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Qiao2023FBXO28). The interaction between FBXO28 and SNAI2 is dependent on the phosphorylation of SNAI2 by protein kinase A (PKA), which enhances FBXO28's ability to promote SNAI2 degradation (Qiao2023FBXO28).

In glioblastoma, FBXO28 interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), facilitating its ubiquitylation and degradation. This process is regulated by PFKFB4, which interacts with FBXO28 and modulates its activity, thereby influencing HIF-1α stability and promoting glioblastoma stem cell survival (Phillips2022PFKFB4). FBXO28 is also implicated in interacting with other proteins such as MYC and HIF-1α, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular contexts (Qiao2023FBXO28).
