# UBE2QL1

## Overview
UBE2QL1 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q family like 1, which is a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in forming K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which are essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. UBE2QL1 is involved in maintaining lysosomal integrity and homeostasis, crucial for the clearance of damaged lysosomes through a process known as lysophagy. The protein is distributed throughout the cytosol in healthy cells but translocates to lysosomes upon damage, facilitating the ubiquitination of lysosomal proteins and recruiting autophagic receptors. This activity is vital for preventing cellular dysfunction and maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBE2QL1 also interacts with several proteins, including FBXW7, and plays a role in regulating protein turnover, impacting processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction. Its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Koerver2019The; Wake2013UBE; Mizushima2019The).

## Function
UBE2QL1 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining lysosomal integrity and homeostasis in human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitination process, primarily forming K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which are essential for recruiting the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase, a key player in lysophagy. This process is vital for the clearance of damaged lysosomes, thereby preventing cellular dysfunction and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Koerver2019The; Mizushima2019The).

In healthy cells, UBE2QL1 is distributed throughout the cytosol but translocates to lysosomes upon damage. It facilitates the ubiquitination of lysosomal proteins, a critical step for recruiting autophagic receptors and initiating lysophagy. This activity is crucial for the efficient clearance of damaged lysosomes and maintaining lysosomal stability (Koerver2019The; Kravic2019Regulation).

UBE2QL1 also plays a role in regulating protein turnover, impacting cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis by preventing the activation of stress signaling pathways that could lead to cellular dysfunction (Koerver2019The; Wake2013UBE).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2QL1 is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation. Alterations in the expression levels of UBE2QL1 can disrupt normal cellular processes, potentially leading to oncogenesis. Dysregulation of this gene may affect the degradation of proteins that control cell cycle and apoptosis, contributing to tumor development and progression. Mutations in UBE2QL1 or changes in its interactions with other proteins can further exacerbate these effects, promoting disease pathogenesis. The precise mechanisms by which UBE2QL1 alterations lead to specific cancers or other diseases are still under investigation, but its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the clinical significance of UBE2QL1 mutations and expression changes is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their impact on disease progression.

## Interactions
UBE2QL1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with FBXW7, an F-box protein that is part of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is crucial for the degradation of FBXW7 targets such as Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) and mTOR, suggesting a mechanism by which UBE2QL1 may exert its tumor suppressor effects (Wake2013UBE).

In the context of lysophagy, UBE2QL1 translocates to damaged lysosomes and interacts with ubiquitination targets and lysophagy effectors. It is involved in the ubiquitination of lysosomal proteins, primarily forming K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which are essential for recruiting the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase. This recruitment is necessary for the formation of LC3-decorated phagophores around damaged lysosomes, indicating UBE2QL1's role in autophagosome formation and lysophagy (Koerver2019The).

UBE2QL1 also cooperates with autophagy receptors such as TAX1BP1 and SQSTM1/p62, facilitating the recruitment of VCP/p97 to damaged lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for efficient lysophagy and the clearance of damaged lysosomes, which is vital for cell survival (Koerver2019The).
