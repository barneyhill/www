protein found in serum. The protein encoded belongs to the collectin family and is an important element in the innate immune system. The protein recognizes and binds to mannose and N-acetylglucosamine on many microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, and viruses including influenza virus, HIV and SARS-CoV. This binding activates the classical complement pathway. Deficiencies of this gene have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases.
