# CPNE5

## Overview
CPNE5 is a gene that encodes the protein copine 5, which is a member of the copine family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties and are involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and signal transduction. Copine 5, in particular, is implicated in calcium-mediated cellular activities and has been studied for its potential roles in neurological and metabolic disorders. The gene's expression and genetic variants have been associated with conditions such as alcohol dependence, obesity, and bipolar disorder, suggesting its involvement in complex genetic pathways that influence these health issues (Wang2015Genetic; Wang2017Stratified). Additionally, changes in CPNE5 expression have been observed in aging, indicating its potential relevance in age-related physiological changes (Maekura2022Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
The CPNE5 gene has been implicated in several health conditions due to its role in calcium-dependent processes. Genetic variants in CPNE5 have been associated with alcohol dependence (AD) and obesity in Caucasian populations. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CPNE5 that are linked to both AD and obesity, suggesting shared genetic pathways between these conditions (Wang2015Genetic). The gene's involvement in these comorbidities highlights its potential as a molecular marker for these disorders (Wang2015Genetic).

CPNE5 has also been noted in the context of bipolar disorder, where it forms a significant epistasis pair with CRLF1, a gene involved in neuronal survival. This suggests that CPNE5 may play a role in the etiology of bipolar disorder through calcium-channel pathways (Wang2017Stratified). Additionally, CPNE5 expression changes have been observed in the context of aging, with increased expression in the hearts of aging mice, although the direct implications of this finding on human health are not fully understood (Maekura2022Proteomic). These associations indicate that CPNE5 may have broader implications in neurological and metabolic disorders.
