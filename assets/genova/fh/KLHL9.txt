# KLHL9

## Overview
KLHL9 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 9, which is part of the BTB-Kelch family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as a substrate adaptor within the KLHL9-Cul3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a critical role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. The protein is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and six Kelch motifs, facilitating its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes such as mitotic progression and cytokinesis (Cirak2010Kelchlike; Shi2019Kelchlike). KLHL9 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in skeletal muscle, and is involved in maintaining muscle and nerve homeostasis. Mutations in KLHL9, such as the p.L95F mutation, have been linked to pathological conditions like distal myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Cirak2010Kelchlike).

## Structure
KLHL9 is a protein that belongs to the Kelch-like family, characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and six Kelch motifs. The BTB/POZ domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to Cullin3 (Cul3) to form E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (Cirak2010Kelchlike; Shi2019Kelchlike). The BACK domain acts as a linker between the BTB and Kelch domains, although its specific functions are less understood (Shi2019Kelchlike). The Kelch motifs form a β-propeller structure, which is essential for substrate binding and interaction with other proteins (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike).

A notable mutation in KLHL9, p.L95F, affects the BTB domain, disrupting its interaction with Cul3 and potentially altering the protein's function in ubiquitination processes (Cirak2010Kelchlike). This mutation involves a leucine to phenylalanine substitution, which can impact the domain's conformation and its ability to form complexes (Cirak2010Kelchlike). KLHL9 is expressed in various tissues, with moderate to high levels in skeletal muscle (Cirak2010Kelchlike). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in cellular functions and disease associations.

## Function
The KLHL9 gene encodes a protein that is part of the BTB-Kelch family, functioning as a substrate adaptor in the KLHL9-Cul3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is crucial for targeting substrate proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells (Cirak2010Kelchlike). In healthy human cells, KLHL9 binds to Cul3 via its BTB domain, which is vital for the formation and function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Cirak2010Kelchlike).

KLHL9 plays a significant role in regulating mitotic progression and cytokinesis by targeting Aurora B kinase for degradation. Aurora B kinase is involved in the assembly and disassembly of intermediate filaments, which are important for maintaining cellular structure and function (Cirak2010Kelchlike). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, including skeletal muscle, and is thought to contribute to muscle and nerve homeostasis (Cirak2010Kelchlike). The KLHL9 protein's function in healthy cells is crucial for maintaining normal muscle and possibly nerve function, and disruptions in its activity can lead to pathological conditions such as distal myopathy (Cirak2010Kelchlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLHL9 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A notable mutation, p.L95F, in the KLHL9 gene is associated with early onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy. This mutation affects the BTB domain of KLHL9, disrupting its interaction with Cul3, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for protein degradation. This disruption is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of the myopathy by impairing the ubiquitination process, leading to muscle atrophy and weakness, particularly in distal limb muscles (Cirak2010Kelchlike).

In cancer, KLHL9 deletions have been associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other cancers. These deletions are linked to the aberrant expression of C/EBPb and C/EBPd proteins, which are involved in mesenchymal reprogramming, a process associated with poor cancer outcomes. The loss of KLHL9 function in these contexts suggests a role in tumor progression through the dysregulation of protein degradation pathways (Chen2014Identification).

Additionally, KLHL9 is implicated in insulin resistance through its role in the degradation of IRS1, a key protein in insulin signaling. Alterations in KLHL9 expression, as part of the KLHL9/KLHL13/CUL3 complex, can lead to increased IRS1 degradation, contributing to insulin resistance and potentially linking KLHL9 to metabolic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency).

## Interactions
KLHL9 is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, forming part of a complex that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. KLHL9 functions as an adaptor in a Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which includes KLHL13 and CUL3. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. One of the key interactions of KLHL9 is with IRS1, where the KLHL9/KLHL13/CUL3 complex promotes IRS1 degradation, contributing to insulin resistance in the context of ATG16L1 deficiency (FrendoCumbo2019Deficiency).

KLHL9 also interacts with the chromosomal passenger protein Aurora B, facilitating its removal from mitotic chromosomes, which is crucial for proper mitotic progression and cytokinesis. This interaction is mediated through the KLHL9/KLHL13/CUL3 complex, which targets Aurora B for ubiquitylation (Sumara2007A).

In the context of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, KLHL9 interacts with the bacterial protein BipD, which recruits the KLHL9/KLHL13/CUL3 complex to ubiquitinate the mitochondrial protein IMMT, initiating mitophagy and aiding bacterial survival (Li2023Burkholderia).
