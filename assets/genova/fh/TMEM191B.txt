# TMEM191B

## Overview
TMEM191B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 191B, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. TMEM191B is located on chromosome 22 within the 22q11.2 region, a genomic area known for its association with several developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Guna2015Comparative). The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been studied in the context of diseases such as Crohn's disease and lung adenocarcinoma, where it has been implicated in treatment response and cancer biology, respectively (Li2022The; Joustra2024Peripheral). Despite its involvement in these clinical contexts, the precise biological roles of the transmembrane protein 191B remain an active area of research.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM191B has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its expression and methylation patterns. In Crohn's disease, TMEM191B has been identified as a significant predictor of response to the biologic treatment ustekinumab. Alterations in the expression of TMEM191B, correlated with DNA methylation changes, have been associated with treatment outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for personalized therapy in Crohn's disease patients (Joustra2024Peripheral).

The gene is also located within the 22q11.2 deletion region, which is associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). This syndrome is linked to a range of developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including DiGeorge syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome. Although TMEM191B itself is not specifically highlighted for direct involvement in these conditions, its presence in this critical genomic region suggests it may contribute to the broader phenotypic spectrum observed in 22q11.2DS (Guna2015Comparative).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, TMEM191B is listed among cuproptosis-related genes, although no mutations were observed in the studied cohort. This indicates that while TMEM191B may not be directly mutated, its expression or regulatory mechanisms could still play a role in cancer biology (Li2022The).
