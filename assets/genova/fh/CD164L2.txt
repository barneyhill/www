# CD164L2

## Overview
CD164L2 is a gene that encodes the protein CD164 molecule-like 2, which is a member of the sialomucin family of proteins. These proteins are typically characterized by their transmembrane nature and involvement in cellular adhesion and signaling processes. The CD164 molecule-like 2 protein is implicated in various biological functions, including immune response modulation and cellular proliferation. Alterations in the expression of CD164L2 have been associated with several pathological conditions, such as viral infections and cancer, suggesting its potential role in disease progression and as a biomarker for certain malignancies (NIAN2015SPARC; Davila2024Transcriptome; Song2024Integrated). Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which CD164L2 influences these processes.

## Clinical Significance
The CD164L2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of porcine encephalomyelitis hemagglutinating virus (PHEV) infection, CD164L2 expression is significantly downregulated in porcine respiratory epithelial cells, suggesting a role in the immune response to viral infections (Davila2024Transcriptome). This downregulation may impact the cell's ability to respond to pathogens, although the specific consequences in humans remain unclear.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells, CD164L2 is highly overexpressed when SPARC is overexpressed, particularly in combination with Ara-C treatment. This suggests a potential role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in cancerous cells (NIAN2015SPARC).

CD164L2 is also downregulated in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HGESS) compared to low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS), indicating its potential involvement in the progression of uterine sarcomas (Song2024Integrated). These findings highlight the gene's possible significance in cancer biology, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.
