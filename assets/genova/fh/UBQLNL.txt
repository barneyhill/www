# UBQLNL

## Overview
The UBQLNL gene encodes the ubiquilin-like protein, which is a member of the ubiquilin family known for their role in protein degradation pathways. Ubiquilin-like proteins are involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis by interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins. This protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-like (UBL) and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, which enable it to bind to both ubiquitin and proteasomes, thus acting as a shuttle factor in the cellular quality control system. The precise biological functions and interactions of the ubiquilin-like protein remain an active area of research, with implications for understanding various cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
