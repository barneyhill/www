# FAM90A18

## Overview
FAM90A18 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A18. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, which may suggest functional similarities among its members. While the specific biological role of FAM90A18 remains to be fully elucidated, proteins in this family are often involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of gene expression. The FAM90A18 gene is located on chromosome 8, and its expression patterns and potential interactions with other proteins are subjects of ongoing research. Understanding the function and interactions of FAM90A18 could provide insights into its role in health and disease, particularly in pathways where it may act as a regulatory element (Qiu2020aarFDC).
