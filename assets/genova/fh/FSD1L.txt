# FSD1L

## Overview
The FSD1L gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III and SPRY domain containing 1 like, which is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III and SPRY domains. These domains are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the protein plays a role in cellular signaling pathways. The FSD1L protein is implicated in regulating endogenous cysteine proteinases, which are crucial for processes such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis, potentially through its angiogenic properties. Additionally, the gene has been associated with reproductive biology and metabolic health programming, particularly in the context of prenatal exposure to gestational hyperglycemia. The gene's activity is influenced by DNA methylation variations, which may have implications for gene regulation and health outcomes in offspring (Taschereau2023Maternal).

## Structure


## Function
The FSD1L gene encodes a protein that contains fibronectin type III and SPRY domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways. These interactions may influence processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and immune response, thereby affecting cellular communication and structural integrity. The exact function of FSD1L in healthy human cells is not fully established, but it is implicated in regulating the activity of endogenous cysteine proteinases through its involvement with type 2 cystatins. This regulation is crucial as cysteine proteinases play a role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis, potentially through the angiogenic properties of FSD1L (Taschereau2023Maternal).

Genome-wide association studies have linked SNPs near the FSD1L gene with age at menarche in females and early reproductive traits in cattle, indicating a possible role in reproductive biology. Additionally, the FSD1L gene may be involved in metabolic health programming, particularly in the context of prenatal exposure to gestational hyperglycemia, although further research is needed to clarify its role in these processes (Taschereau2023Maternal). The gene's activity is observed in the context of DNA methylation variations influenced by maternal glycemia during pregnancy, which may have implications for gene regulation and health outcomes in offspring (Taschereau2023Maternal).

## Clinical Significance
The FSD1L gene has been implicated in various health conditions due to its role in DNA methylation changes associated with maternal glycemia during pregnancy. Research by Taschereau et al. has shown that higher maternal glucose levels are linked to lower DNA methylation at the cg00967989 site in the FSD1L gene in offspring, both at birth and at five years of age. This epigenetic alteration may influence the gene's expression, potentially affecting metabolic health programming in children exposed to gestational hyperglycemia (Taschereau2023Maternal).

The FSD1L gene encodes type 2 cystatins, which are involved in regulating cysteine proteinases. These proteinases play a role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that alterations in FSD1L expression could be linked to cancer progression through its angiogenic properties (Taschereau2023Maternal). Although the exact role of FSD1L in humans remains unclear, its association with DNA methylation changes due to prenatal exposure to maternal hyperglycemia suggests a potential link to chronic disease predisposition (Taschereau2023Maternal). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of these findings and the gene's role in disease development.
