# IPMK

## Overview
Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional enzyme belonging to the kinase family, specifically known for its role in phosphorylating inositol phosphates. The IPMK protein is characterized by a conserved kinase structure, including an ATP-grasp domain and a unique 'KEY motif' that facilitates its enzymatic activity (Wang2024Xray; Shears2019Inositol). Functionally, IPMK is involved in critical cellular processes such as gene expression, DNA repair, and cell growth by participating in various signaling pathways, including AKT activation and Wnt signaling (Seacrist2018Crystallographic; Wang2017Structural). It interacts with several key proteins, such as mTOR and p53, and is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation (Bang2014Convergence). The gene's significance is underscored by its essential role in organismal development, as evidenced by embryonic lethality in IPMK knockout mice (Wang2017Structural). Additionally, alterations in IPMK expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sowd2024IPMK; Guha2019IPMK).

## Structure
The human inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) protein exhibits a conserved molecular structure typical of the kinase family, characterized by an N-terminal lobe and a C-terminal lobe. The N-lobe contains anti-parallel β-sheets and a helical subdomain, while the C-lobe is primarily α-helical, facilitating substrate recognition (Shears2019Inositol). The ATP-binding site is located at the interface of these lobes, with a 'Gly-loop' in the N-lobe interacting with nucleotide phosphates (Shears2019Inositol). 

IPMK features an ATP-grasp domain, crucial for its kinase activity, and a unique 'KEY motif' consisting of Lys75, Glu86, and Tyr90, which forms a hydrogen bond network with inhibitors (Wang2024Xray). The protein also contains a 'catalytic triad' involving salt bridges between key residues, a conserved feature in protein kinases (Shears2019Inositol).

The tertiary structure of IPMK includes a constrained, horseshoe-shaped substrate pocket formed by an α-helix, a 310 helix, and a tri-proline loop, distinct from other orthologs (Wang2017Structural). The quaternary structure involves dimerization mediated through contacts in the IP-binding helix (Seacrist2018Crystallographic). The presence of disordered domains in IPMK is noted to modulate ATP binding and kinase activity, potentially through protein-protein interactions (Seacrist2018Crystallographic).

## Function
Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in various cellular signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, which are essential for cellular processes such as gene expression, DNA repair, and cell growth (Shears2019Inositol; Wang2017Structural). IPMK exhibits dual kinase activities, functioning as both an inositol phosphate kinase and a phosphoinositide 3-kinase. It phosphorylates inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) to generate higher-order inositol polyphosphates, such as InsP5 and InsP6, which have multiple cellular roles (SHEARS2004How; Wang2017Structural).

IPMK is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation and mRNA export, impacting cellular differentiation programs (Wang2017Structural). It also interacts with key signaling proteins, such as mTOR, p53, and AMPK, indicating its involvement in pathways like AKT activation, Wnt signaling, and LKB1/AMPK signaling (Seacrist2018Crystallographic; Bang2014Convergence). The enzyme's activity is modulated by disordered domains that affect ATP binding and kinase activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism through protein-protein interactions (Seacrist2018Crystallographic). The knockout of the IPMK gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, underscoring its importance in organismal development (Wang2017Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IPMK gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the liver, IPMK is crucial for regulating autophagy, particularly lipophagy, and its deletion can lead to increased liver inflammation and impaired regeneration. This is evidenced by increased inflammatory and apoptotic cells in the liver and heightened damage in response to cytotoxic insults, suggesting a cytoprotective role for IPMK (Guha2019IPMK).

In the context of cancer, IPMK influences histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) activity and histone H4 acetylation, which are critical for gene expression regulation. Alterations in IPMK could impact HDAC3 activity, potentially affecting conditions like solid tumors and prostate cancers (Sowd2024IPMK).

IPMK also plays a role in the immune response by stabilizing TRAF6, a key signal transducer in Toll-like receptor signaling. Its deletion in macrophages leads to reduced inflammatory responses, suggesting that IPMK is a critical regulator of immune responses and could be targeted for managing inflammatory diseases (Kim2017Inositol).

In neuroinflammation, miR-23b targets IPMK to alleviate brain injury in intracerebral hemorrhage by reducing inflammation and autophagy, highlighting IPMK's involvement in neuroinflammatory conditions (Hu2019MicroRNA23b).

## Interactions
Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. IPMK interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), stabilizing it by preventing K48-linked ubiquitination, which is crucial for maintaining toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production (Kim2017Inositol). This interaction is independent of IPMK's catalytic activity and highlights its role in modulating immune responses (Kim2017Inositol).

IPMK also interacts with the nuclear receptor SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1) when bound to PIP2, selectively phosphorylating PIP2 to generate PIP3. This phosphorylation is essential for SF-1's transcriptional activity, affecting the expression of target genes such as SHP and StAR (Blind2012Direct). The interaction between IPMK and SF-1 is facilitated by an IPMK-specific loop, suggesting a unique mechanism of substrate recognition (Blind2012Direct).

Additionally, IPMK is involved in Wnt signaling through its interaction with Dishevelled-3 (Dvl3), which is necessary for its translocation to the cell membrane and subsequent signaling events (Wang2012Dvl3). These interactions underscore IPMK's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
