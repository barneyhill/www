# HNRNPCL2

## Overview
HNRNPCL2 is a gene that encodes the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C like 2, which is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. These proteins are primarily involved in the processing and transport of pre-mRNA in the nucleus. HNRNPCL2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA binding and regulation of gene expression. The protein plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, influencing the stability and translation of mRNA. It is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where it has been associated with the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and miRNA processing in colorectal cancer (Sun2020RNA-binding). Additionally, alterations in the expression of HNRNPCL2 have been linked to metabolic disorders such as prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its potential role in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism (Czajkowska2024Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPCL2, also known as RALY, plays a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC) by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism through miRNA processing. It is a key regulatory component in the Drosha complex, promoting the post-transcriptional processing of specific miRNAs, such as miR-483, miR-676, and miR-877. These miRNAs downregulate metabolism-associated genes, leading to altered mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Increased levels of RALY are associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, and its inhibition has been shown to reduce tumor growth and progression, suggesting that targeting RALY could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC (Sun2020RNA-binding).

In the context of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D), downregulation of HNRNPCL2, along with other hnRNPs, has been observed in prediabetic individuals. This downregulation may impact insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, potentially linking altered expression of hnRNPs to conditions like insulin resistance and T2D (Czajkowska2024Exploring).

Mutations in HNRNPCL2 have also been identified in the context of endometrial cancer, with four specific mutation sites noted. These mutations are part of broader genetic studies aimed at identifying potential biomarkers for sporadic and Lynch syndrome-related endometrial cancer (&lt; em&gt; p&gt; Gao2020&lt; HNRNPCL1&lt; /em&gt).
