# NTF3

## Overview
The NTF3 gene encodes the protein neurotrophin 3, a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are essential for the development, maintenance, and function of the vertebrate nervous system. Neurotrophin 3 primarily interacts with the TrkC receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, to mediate its effects on neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (Kim1994Neurotrophin; HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). It also has the ability to bind to other Trk receptors, such as TrkA and TrkB, albeit with lower affinity (HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). The protein plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity by modulating synaptic efficacy and connections, influencing processes such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic growth (Yang2001PI3; He2000Intracellular). NTF3 is involved in various signaling pathways, including Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and PLC-γ1, which are crucial for its neuromodulatory functions (HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). Alterations in the NTF3 gene have been associated with neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (Liu2015Polymorphisms; Hattori2002Novel).

## Function
Neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) is a crucial protein involved in the development and function of the nervous system. It primarily binds to the TrkC receptor, although it can also interact with TrkB and TrkA receptors, influencing neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (Kim1994Neurotrophin; HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). NTF3 plays a significant role in synaptic transmission by modulating synaptic efficacy and connections in various brain areas and neuromuscular junctions (HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). It enhances neurotransmitter release by mobilizing intracellular calcium stores, a process mediated by inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors, leading to the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) (Yang2001PI3; He2000Intracellular).

NTF3 is involved in the structural and functional plasticity of the nervous system, influencing synaptic morphology, including axonal arborization and synaptic growth (HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). It regulates synaptic vesicle densities and the length of the synaptic contour, thereby strengthening synaptic connections. In the cochlea, NTF3 regulates ribbon synapse density and can promote synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma (Wan2014Neurotrophin3). These functions highlight NTF3's role as a neuromodulator, crucial for maintaining healthy neural function and facilitating neural repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NTF3 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In schizophrenia, polymorphisms in the promoter region of the NTF3 gene, such as the G/−3004/A polymorphism, have shown a weakly significant difference in genotype distribution between patients and controls, suggesting a modest effect on susceptibility to the disorder (Hattori2002Novel). Haplotype analysis has indicated an increased frequency of the G(−3004)-A3 haplotype in schizophrenics, and the A3 allele of a CA repeat polymorphism in the first intron is associated with smaller hippocampi in these patients (Hattori2002Novel). A rare missense mutation, Gly/−63/Glu, has been linked to severe forms of schizophrenia, although it is uncommon in Caucasian populations (Hattori2002Novel).

In Alzheimer's disease, specific NTF3 polymorphisms have been associated with disease risk and progression. The rs6489630 T allele may have a protective role against Alzheimer's in males, as it is associated with higher cognitive scores and a lower prevalence in male patients compared to controls (Liu2015Polymorphisms). The rs6332 polymorphism is linked to an earlier onset of Alzheimer's in non-ApoE-ε4 carriers, with the A allele contributing to this effect (Liu2015Polymorphisms). These findings suggest that NTF3 polymorphisms may influence the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in relation to gender and genetic background.

## Interactions
Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3) primarily interacts with the TrkC receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, to mediate its effects on neuronal differentiation, growth, and survival. This interaction is crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity, as NTF3 binding to TrkC leads to receptor dimerization and activation of several signaling pathways, including Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and PLC-γ1, which are important for synaptic modulation (HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3). NTF3 can also interact with other Trk receptors, such as TrkA and TrkB, although its primary affinity is for TrkC (HernándezEcheagaray2020Neurotrophin3).

NTF3 is a target gene of the transcription factor POU3F2, which regulates its expression during neuronal differentiation. POU3F2 binds directly to the NTF3 promoter, enhancing its activity and influencing neuronal cell viability and differentiation (Lin2018NTF3). This interaction highlights the role of NTF3 in the POU3F2/NTF3 pathway, which is significant for neuronal differentiation processes (Lin2018NTF3).

In the cochlea, NTF3 derived from supporting cells regulates ribbon synapse density and promotes synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma, indicating its role in synaptic survival and recovery (Wan2014Neurotrophin3).
