# HOATZ

## Overview
The HOATZ gene encodes the HOATZ cilia and flagella associated protein, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, essential for the assembly and maintenance of these cellular appendages. Cilia and flagella are vital for various cellular processes, including motility, sensory reception, and signal transduction, and the HOATZ protein is integral to these functions. Mutations or dysregulation of the HOATZ gene can lead to a range of ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
