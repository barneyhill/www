# UPF1

## Overview
UPF1 is a gene that encodes the UPF1 RNA helicase and ATPase, a pivotal enzyme in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This protein is classified as an RNA helicase and ATPase, playing a critical role in maintaining mRNA quality control by degrading mRNAs with premature stop codons, thus preventing the synthesis of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. The UPF1 protein is characterized by its helicase domain, which facilitates the unwinding of RNA structures, and its ATPase activity, which provides the necessary energy for these processes. It interacts with various components of the NMD pathway, including UPF2 and UPF3, and is regulated through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. UPF1's function is essential for proper translation termination and mRNA surveillance, with significant implications for cellular health and disease (Staszewski2023UPF1—From; BHATTACHARYA2000Characterization; Fiorini2012Tight).

## Structure
The UPF1 protein is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids forming specific domains, such as the helicase domain and the cysteine-histidine-rich (CH) domain. The secondary structure of UPF1 comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, with the helicase core containing two RecA-like domains that form a nucleotide-binding pocket and a composite RNA-binding surface (Gowravaram2018A; Cheng2006Structural).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its function. The CH domain, located at the N-terminus, contains zinc-binding motifs crucial for structural integrity and interaction with other proteins like UPF2 (Kadlec2006Crystal). The helicase core is flanked by a serine-glutamine (SQ) motif-rich region at the C-terminus, which interacts with the helicase core to inhibit its activity (Fiorini2012Tight).

UPF1 exists in two alternatively spliced isoforms, differing in the length of a regulatory loop within the helicase core, affecting RNA-binding and catalytic activities (Gowravaram2018Aa). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate UPF1's activity, particularly within the SQ domain (Fiorini2012Tight).

## Function
UPF1 is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, a cellular mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons to prevent the production of truncated and potentially harmful proteins. In healthy human cells, UPF1 functions as an RNA helicase and ATPase, unwinding RNA structures and facilitating the assembly of NMD complexes. Its helicase activity is characterized by a 5' to 3' directionality, which is essential for displacing partially duplexed nucleic acids in an ATP-dependent manner (BHATTACHARYA2000Characterization). UPF1's ATPase activity is RNA-dependent and is crucial for its role in NMD, as it provides the energy required for these processes (BHATTACHARYA2000Characterization).

UPF1 is highly processive, allowing it to translocate over several kilobase pairs without detaching from its substrate, which is important for its role in RNA-related mechanisms (Fiorini2015Human). It is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins and factors involved in the NMD pathway, such as Upf2 and Upf3, to enhance translation termination and degrade aberrant mRNAs (Cheng2006Structural). This activity is vital for maintaining mRNA quality control and proper translation termination in healthy human cells (BHATTACHARYA2000Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the UPF1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, UPF1 is often downregulated, which correlates with poor prognosis and low overall survival rates. This downregulation leads to dysfunction in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, resulting in increased levels of toxic transcripts and tumor progression (Staszewski2023UPF1—From). In pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma, somatic mutations in UPF1 have been identified as unique molecular markers, leading to impaired NMD and increased aberrant mRNAs (Staszewski2023UPF1—From). 

In neurological disorders, UPF1 mutations or dysregulation can lead to conditions such as spastic paraparesis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and autism spectrum disorder. UPF1 knockdown in the brain increases the expression of NMD targets associated with these diseases (Staszewski2023UPF1—From). UPF1 also plays a role in viral infections, where it is hijacked by viral genomes to promote replication and infectivity (Staszewski2023UPF1—From). 

Overall, UPF1 mutations and alterations have significant clinical implications, affecting prognosis, treatment response, and the potential for targeted therapies in various diseases (Staszewski2023UPF1—From).

## Interactions
UPF1, a key component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, interacts with various proteins and complexes to regulate mRNA decay. It forms part of the SURF complex, which includes SMG-1, eRF1, and eRF3, and interacts with the exon junction complex (EJC) to facilitate its phosphorylation, a crucial step in NMD (Kashima2006Binding; Ivanov2008Interactions). UPF1 also associates with UPF2 and UPF3B, which are essential for forming the DECID complex, necessary for recognizing premature termination codons (PTCs) (Kashima2006Binding).

UPF1's interactions extend to the eukaryotic translation initiation complex 3 (eIF3), with several subunits identified as mRNA-independent interactors, suggesting a role in translation regulation (Flury2014Characterization). It also binds to ribosomal proteins from the 40S and 60S subunits, indicating potential new roles in cellular pathways (Flury2014Characterization).

Phosphorylated UPF1 interacts with SMG-5, SMG-6, and SMG-7, forming complexes that are crucial for mRNA surveillance and decay (Ohnishi2003Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight UPF1's central role in the dynamic assembly and function of the NMD machinery.
