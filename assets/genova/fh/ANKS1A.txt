# ANKS1A

## Overview
ANKS1A is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 1A, also known as AIDA-1. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including ankyrin repeats, sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular transport processes (Emaduddin2008Odin; Park2016Defective). ANKS1A is primarily involved in the transport and localization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), playing a critical role in cellular signaling and maintaining cerebrovascular health (Lee2023ANKS1A; Lee2016Anks1a). The protein's interactions with components of the COPII vesicle system are essential for the anterograde transport of RTKs, which is significant in processes such as tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration (Lee2023ANKS1A; Lee2016Anks1a). Alterations in ANKS1A expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Lee2023ANKS1A; Lee2016Anks1a).

## Structure
ANKS1A, also known as AIDA-1, is a protein characterized by its structural domains, including six ankyrin repeats at the N-terminus, two sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain at the C-terminus (Emaduddin2008Odin; Park2016Defective). The ankyrin repeats contribute to the protein's secondary structure, forming a helix-loop-helix conformation, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, such as binding to the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of EphA2 (Lee2016Anks1a). The SAM domains are involved in oligomerization and protein binding, playing a role in regulating the endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases like EphA2 (Mercurio2012Solution).

ANKS1A is a phosphoprotein, with phosphorylation sites at Ser-647 and Ser-663 being critical for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and its function in the selective packaging of EphA2 into COPII vesicles (Park2016Defective). The protein is also subject to tyrosine phosphorylation at sites such as pY454 and pY833, although the regulatory roles of these modifications are not fully understood (Emaduddin2008Odin). Multiple splice variants of ANKS1A exist, leading to different isoforms that may have diverse roles in cellular processes (Ryu2021The).

## Function
The ANKS1A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport and localization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in human cells. ANKS1A is involved in the anterograde transport of RTKs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for their proper functioning at the cell surface. This process involves the interaction of ANKS1A with Sec23, a component of COPII vesicles, facilitating the selective packaging of RTKs like EphA2 into these vesicles (Lee2016Anks1a; Park2016Defective).

In brain endothelial cells, ANKS1A regulates the levels of LRP1 on the cell surface, which is critical for the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides across the blood-brain barrier. ANKS1A interacts with NPXY motifs in the LRP1 cytoplasmic tail, promoting its transport from the ER to the cell surface, thereby maintaining cerebrovascular health and preventing neurodegeneration (Lee2023ANKS1A).

ANKS1A is specifically expressed in brain endothelial cells and is influenced by interactions with pericytes and astrocytes, highlighting its role in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and efficient Aβ clearance (Lee2023ANKS1A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ANKS1A gene have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, ANKS1A is overexpressed in various types, such as non-small cell lung cancer, where it is associated with advanced stages of the disease. This overexpression may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the transport and localization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like EphA2 and ErbB2, which are crucial for cell signaling pathways involved in cancer progression (Lee2016Anks1a).

In neurological disorders, a specific missense variant of ANKS1A, rs6930932, which results in an A355D mutation, has been linked to early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) in a Korean population. This variant is a loss-of-function mutation that disrupts the normal function of ANKS1A in facilitating the export of the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. This disruption impairs the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides across the blood-brain barrier, contributing to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Lee2023ANKS1A).

ANKS1A deficiency has also been associated with cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)-like lesions in aged mice, suggesting a role in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity and preventing vascular abnormalities (Lee2023Cerebral).

## Interactions
ANKS1A, also known as Anks1a, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EphA2 and ErbB2, facilitating their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via COPII vesicles. The ankyrin repeat domain of ANKS1A binds to EphA2, while its PTB domain interacts with Sec23, a component of COPII vesicles, to promote the packaging of EphA2 into these vesicles (Lee2016Anks1a). This interaction is essential for the anterograde transport of RTKs, which is significant in processes like tumorigenesis (Lee2016Anks1a).

ANKS1A also interacts with the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in brain endothelial cells, playing a role in cerebrovascular clearance. The PTB domain of ANKS1A binds to the cytoplasmic tail of LRP1, which is important for the transcytosis of amyloid-beta peptides across the blood-brain barrier (Lee2023ANKS1A). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and is implicated in conditions such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Lee2023ANKS1A).
