# HTR3B

## Overview
The HTR3B gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3B (5-HT3B), a subunit of the serotonin receptor 3 (5-HT3) complex, which is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel family. This gene is crucial for the formation of functional heteromeric 5-HT3AB receptors, as the 5-HT3B subunit must coassemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to form these receptors. The heteromeric 5-HT3AB receptors exhibit unique biophysical properties, including higher single-channel conductance and altered ion permeability compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (JENSEN20083B; Barnes2009The). These receptors are involved in fast synaptic transmission and play significant roles in modulating neurotransmitter release, influencing mood regulation, anxiety, and gastrointestinal function (Walstab2008Naturally; Tzvetkov2007Tissue-specific). The HTR3B gene's expression and function are implicated in various psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Hammer2012Replication; Wang2023Association).

## Structure
The HTR3B gene encodes the 5-HT3B subunit, which is part of the serotonin receptor 3 (5-HT3) complex. The primary structure of the 5-HT3B subunit consists of 436 amino acids, following a revision from the initially reported 441 amino acids due to a change in the predicted translation initiation site (Barnes2009The). The protein includes a large extracellular N-terminus, four hydrophobic transmembrane regions, and a short extracellular C-terminus (Walstab2008Naturally).

The 5-HT3B subunit cannot form functional receptors on its own but can coassemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to form heteromeric 5-HT3AB receptors. These heteromeric receptors exhibit distinct biophysical properties, such as higher single-channel current conductance and lower Ca2+ permeability compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (JENSEN20083B). The quaternary structure of the heteromeric 5-HT3AB receptor includes two 5-HT3A and three 5-HT3B subunits arranged in a specific order (B-B-A-B-A) (Barnes2009The).

Post-translational modifications of the 5-HT3B subunit may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect receptor formation and function (Barnes2009The). The gene also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in brain-specific transcripts BT-1 and BT-2, with BT-2 lacking a substantial portion of the N-terminal domain (JENSEN20083B).

## Function
The HTR3B gene encodes the 5-HT3B subunit, which is part of the 5-HT3 receptor family, a group of ligand-gated ion channels activated by serotonin. This receptor is involved in fast synaptic transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The 5-HT3B subunit cannot form functional receptors on its own but coassembles with the 5-HT3A subunit to form heteromeric 5-HT3AB receptors. These heteromeric receptors exhibit distinct biophysical properties, such as higher single-channel conductance and lower calcium permeability compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (JENSEN20083B; Barnes2009The).

The 5-HT3 receptors, including those containing the 5-HT3B subunit, play roles in modulating neurotransmitter release, influencing processes like mood regulation, anxiety, and gastrointestinal function. They are expressed in various tissues, including the gut and central nervous system, where they contribute to gastrointestinal motility and potentially mental functions and psychiatric disorders (Walstab2008Naturally; Tzvetkov2007Tissue-specific). The presence of the 5-HT3B subunit in heteromeric receptors is crucial for their functional diversity, affecting receptor signaling and pharmacological responses (Walstab2008Naturally; Barnes2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HTR3B gene have been associated with several psychiatric disorders. The rs1176744 polymorphism in HTR3B is linked to major depressive disorder and executive dysfunction, with the A allele increasing the risk of depression and cognitive deficits, while the C allele is considered protective (Wang2023Association). The Y129S variant in HTR3B is associated with major depression, particularly in women, and affects the signaling of the 5-HT3AB receptor, potentially influencing neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability (Krzywkowski2008High-frequency; Yamada2006Distinguishable). This variant has also been linked to bipolar affective disorder, anorexia nervosa, and irritable bowel syndrome, suggesting a broader impact on psychiatric conditions (Hammer2012Replication).

Alterations in HTR3B expression, such as those caused by a -100_-102delAAG deletion-insertion polymorphism, can lead to increased gene expression and have been associated with chemotherapy-induced emesis and the efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (Meineke2008Functional). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HTR3B in psychiatric and other medical conditions.

## Interactions
The HTR3B gene encodes the 5-HT3B subunit, which is a component of the 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. This subunit cannot form functional receptors on its own and must coassemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to create heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. These heteromeric receptors exhibit distinct biophysical properties, such as higher single-channel conductance and altered ion permeability compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (JENSEN20083B; Barrera2005Atomic; Barnes2009The).

The 5-HT3B subunit is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed alone due to a retention motif. However, co-expression with the 5-HT3A subunit allows the heteromeric receptor to be exported to the cell membrane, highlighting the importance of their interaction for proper receptor assembly and function (Barnes2009The). The B-B subunit interface is crucial for the receptor's assembly and function, as it influences ion channel conductance and agonist binding (Barrera2005Atomic).

The HTR3B subunit also interacts with chaperone proteins such as hRIC-3, which can influence the expression and assembly of these receptors, promoting the formation of homopentameric 5-HT3A receptors at the expense of heteromeric ones (Walstab2008Naturally).
