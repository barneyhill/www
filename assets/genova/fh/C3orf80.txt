# C3orf80

## Overview
C3orf80 is a gene located on chromosome 3 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 3 open reading frame 80. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C3orf80 is not currently categorized under any specific protein family such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have a unique or less characterized role within the cell. Research into C3orf80 and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential interactions and implications in human health and disease.
