# COL9A3

## Overview
The COL9A3 gene encodes the collagen type IX alpha 3 chain, a critical component of the extracellular matrix, particularly in cartilage. This protein is categorized as a fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices (FACIT), playing a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of cartilage by interacting with other collagen types and proteoglycans (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations). The alpha 3 chain is essential for the proper assembly of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the resilience and flexibility of joints and other connective tissues (Lecci2018A). Mutations in COL9A3 have been implicated in various conditions, including multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance (Nash2021Heterozygous). Additionally, the interaction of COL9A3 with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP3 has been associated with cancer progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2021USP3).

## Structure
The COL9A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type IX collagen, which is a fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices (FACIT). This protein is a component of the extracellular matrix in cartilage and is involved in stabilizing interactions with type II collagen fibrils (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations). The primary structure of the alpha 3 chain consists of a sequence of amino acids, including glycine, which is crucial for the formation of the collagen triple helix (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations). 

The secondary structure of type IX collagen includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chain, allowing it to interact with other extracellular matrix components. In its quaternary structure, the alpha 3 chain assembles with the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains to form a heterotrimeric molecule (Nixon2019Homozygous).

Type IX collagen undergoes post-translational modifications, such as hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, which are essential for its stability and function. These modifications facilitate the formation of covalent crosslinks with type II collagen, enhancing the structural integrity of cartilage (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations).

## Function
The COL9A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type IX collagen, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cartilage. In healthy human cells, type IX collagen plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage by interacting with other collagen types, such as type II and XI, and proteoglycans. This interaction helps form a stable network that supports the mechanical properties of cartilage, allowing it to withstand compressive and tensile stresses (Lecci2018A).

Type IX collagen is involved in the proper assembly of the fibrillar structure of the ECM, which is essential for maintaining tissue mechanical properties and facilitating chondrocyte-matrix interactions. These interactions are vital for cartilage integrity and joint health, as they contribute to the resilience and flexibility of joints (Lecci2018A). In the vitreous body of the eye, type IX collagen interacts with type II collagen to maintain the appropriate inter-fibril distance, preventing vitreous detachment from the retina (Nash2021Heterozygous).

The COL9A3 gene is also expressed in the cartilage of the cochlea, joints, and spine, providing structural support in these connective tissues. Variants in COL9A3 have been associated with conditions such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and sensorineural hearing loss (Nash2021Heterozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL9A3 gene are associated with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), a skeletal disorder characterized by joint surface irregularity, bone fragmentation, and dysplasia. Specific mutations, such as the A→T transversion and G→A transition in the acceptor splice site of intron 2, lead to exon 3 skipping and a 12 amino acid deletion in the COL3 domain, resulting in skeletal abnormalities (Lecci2018A). Another mutation, c.104G>A in exon 2, causes a Gly to Asp substitution, leading to self-aggregation of the polypeptide and impacting collagen type IX heterotrimer formation (Jeong2014Novel). These mutations disrupt the structure and function of collagen type IX, contributing to the pathogenesis of MED and early-onset osteoarthritis (Lecci2018A).

COL9A3 mutations have also been linked to non-syndromic sensorineural deafness. A recessive in-frame deletion in exon 11 and a dominant missense mutation in exon 31 affect the COL2 and COL1 domains, respectively, potentially disrupting the collagen type IX structure and affecting the tectorial membrane in the inner ear (Lecci2018A). Additionally, a polymorphism known as the Trp3 allele is associated with an increased risk of lumbar disc degeneration (Lecci2018A).

## Interactions
COL9A3, the alpha 3 chain of type IX collagen, is involved in significant protein interactions that contribute to its role in gastric cancer progression. It interacts with USP3, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which stabilizes COL9A3 by removing Lys 48-linked ubiquitin chains, preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the stability and expression levels of COL9A3 in gastric cancer cells (Wu2021USP3). The stabilization of COL9A3 by USP3 is associated with the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enhances cancer cell invasion and migration (Wu2021USP3).

The interaction between USP3 and COL9A3 is mediated by the UCH domain of USP3, which is responsible for binding and deubiquitinating COL9A3, thereby enhancing its stability and protein levels (Wu2021USP3). This interaction is part of a broader regulatory network where COL9A3, along with COL6A5, acts as a mediator of USP3's oncogenic activity, influencing cancer progression and metastasis (Wu2021USP3). The USP3-COL9A3 axis is suggested as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer (Wu2021USP3).
