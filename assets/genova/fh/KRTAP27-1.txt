# KRTAP27-1

## Overview
KRTAP27-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 27-1, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral to the structural composition of hair and wool fibers, where they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form a robust matrix that contributes to the mechanical properties of hair, such as texture and strength (He2022Gene). The KRTAP27-1 gene is primarily expressed in hair follicles, where its protein product plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of hair structure. Although the gene has been studied in the context of various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancer, its clinical significance remains largely unexplored, with current research indicating a need for further investigation to fully understand its potential implications in human health (Kim2020Analysis).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the KRTAP27-1 gene, which encodes keratin-associated protein 27-1, remains largely unexplored. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), a study by Kim et al. investigated the role of KRTAP27-1 through genomic analysis and functional assays. Although the gene was included in the study, it did not show significant changes in cell-based assays, suggesting that its mutations or expression alterations may not have a substantial clinical impact in CRC (Kim2020Analysis).

The same study identified a germline variant, KRTAP27-1 rs2244485, which was potentially associated with a gastric cancer pedigree and less strictly defined hereditary colorectal cancer. However, the clinical significance of this association requires further validation (Kim2020Analysis).

In a separate study on melanoma, KRTAP27-1 was noted for a methylation change, but the clinical implications of this finding were not detailed, indicating that more research is needed to understand its role in disease (de2014Genomewide).

Overall, while some studies have identified potential associations of KRTAP27-1 with certain cancers, its clinical significance remains uncertain, necessitating further investigation.

## Interactions
KRTAP27-1, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is involved in forming a network of strong protein interactions crucial for hair follicle development. In sheep, KRTAP27-1 interacts with other keratin-associated proteins such as KRTAP24-1, KRTAP8-1, KRTAP15-1, and KRTAP11-1, forming a network of strong protein interactions (He2022Gene). This interaction network is significant for the structural integrity of hair fibers, as KRTAPs typically form disulfide bonds with keratin intermediate filaments, influencing hair texture and strength.

The study by He et al. highlights the importance of KRT14, NOTCH1, and FGF7 in the interaction network, with KRT14 associating 17 KRT proteins with other proteins through NOTCH1 and FGF7, indicating a complex interaction landscape involving KRTAP27-1 (He2022Gene). However, specific interactions of KRTAP27-1 with nucleic acids or its role in multiprotein complexes beyond these interactions are not detailed in the available literature. The focus remains on its role within the keratin-associated protein network and its contribution to hair follicle development and structure.
