# KCNK1

## Overview
KCNK1 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 1, commonly referred to as the TWIK-1 channel. This protein is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is characterized by its unique structure comprising four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit. TWIK-1 channels are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability by facilitating background potassium conductance. They are expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, kidney, and lung, where they contribute to essential physiological processes such as cell volume regulation and neuronal excitability. The activity of TWIK-1 is modulated by factors such as pH, which can alter its ion selectivity and function in different cellular environments (Chatelain2012TWIK1; Enyedi2010Molecular). Additionally, KCNK1 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cardiac disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance beyond its primary role as a potassium channel (Christensen2016The; Hou2024KCNK1).

## Structure
The KCNK1 gene encodes the TWIK-1 potassium channel, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The protein structure is characterized by four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which is a distinctive feature of K2P channels (Orias1997Cloning; Enyedi2010Molecular). TWIK-1 forms functional homodimers, linked by disulfide bridges between cysteines at residue 69, which is crucial for its structural integrity and functional expression (Lesage2000Molecular; Enyedi2010Molecular).

The channel's architecture includes a unique arrangement of transmembrane helices, with a kinked C-helix that may play a role in gating. This structure features a hydrophobic barrier deep within the inner pore, formed by specific leucine residues, which acts as a major barrier to ion conduction and contributes to the channel's low activity (Aryal2014A). The TWIK-1 channel is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which may influence its functional expression, although this remains a topic of debate (Enyedi2010Molecular).

## Function
The KCNK1 gene encodes the TWIK-1 channel, a member of the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in healthy human cells. TWIK-1 channels are primarily involved in background potassium conductance, which helps stabilize the negative electrical potential across the plasma membrane by allowing the efflux of potassium ions (K+) (Chatelain2012TWIK1; Miller2012Crystal). This function is essential for opposing membrane depolarization and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

TWIK-1 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, kidney, and lung, where it contributes to physiological processes such as cell volume regulation, apoptosis, and neuronal excitability (Chatelain2012TWIK1). In cardiac tissues, TWIK-1 is involved in regulating heart rate and atrial size, playing a role in sinus node function and heart development (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain; Christensen2016The). The channel's activity is modulated by factors such as pH, with its ion selectivity shifting from potassium to sodium ions under acidic conditions, which can influence its function in different cellular environments (Chatelain2012TWIK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KCNK1 gene, which encodes the TWIK-1 potassium channel, have been associated with various cardiac conditions. In zebrafish models, knockdown of KCNK1 orthologues results in atrial dilatation and bradycardia, indicating a role in heart development and sinus node function (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain; Christensen2016The). In humans, KCNK1 expression levels are altered in several cardiac conditions. Elevated KCNK1 transcript levels have been observed in patients with atrial dilatation, while lower levels are noted in those with atrial fibrillation (AF) (Christensen2016The). Specific KCNK1 variants, such as p.R171H, p.I198M, and p.G236S, have been identified in patients with familial and early-onset lone AF, suggesting a potential genetic link to this condition (Christensen2016The).

KCNK1 is also implicated in the regulation of cardiac currents, potentially contributing to rhythm disturbances induced by hypokalemia (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain). The gene's role in forming heterodimeric channels with other K2P subunits, such as K2P3.1 (TASK-1), may influence the properties of these channels and their physiological functions (Wiedmann2021TwoPoreDomain).

## Interactions
KCNK1, also known as TWIK-1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and role in cancer progression. In breast cancer, KCNK1 interacts with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), enhancing LDHA's enzymatic activity and promoting lactate production. This interaction contributes to increased glycolysis and histone lactylation, which in turn up-regulates genes associated with cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Hou2024KCNK1). The interaction between KCNK1 and LDHA was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies, demonstrating that KCNK1 enhances LDHA's binding capacity (Hou2024KCNK1).

In bladder cancer, KCNK1 is identified as a hub gene in protein-protein interaction networks, particularly in the formation of ion transmembrane transport proteins. It is involved in multiple cell metabolism-related signaling pathways, including glucose metabolism (Zhang2024Overexpressed). The study also suggests potential regulatory interactions with transcription factors such as GRHL2 and FOXA1, which may influence KCNK1 expression through chromatin interactions (Zhang2024Overexpressed). These interactions highlight KCNK1's role in cellular processes beyond its function as a potassium channel, contributing to its involvement in cancer progression.
