# SOX2

## Overview
SOX2 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 2, a pivotal protein involved in the regulation of embryonic development and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. As a transcription factor, SOX2 is categorized within the high-mobility group (HMG) of proteins, characterized by its ability to bind and bend DNA, thereby influencing gene expression. The SOX2 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal and undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells by interacting with other key transcription factors such as Oct4 and Nanog. It is also essential for the development and function of various tissues, including the brain, eyes, and reproductive system. Dysregulation of SOX2 expression or mutations in the SOX2 gene can lead to a range of developmental disorders and have been implicated in various cancers, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Kelberman2008SOX2; Alatzoglou2011SOX2; Sarkar2013The).

## Structure
The SOX2 protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding. This domain allows SOX2 to interact with the minor groove of DNA, bending it significantly, which is essential for its role in transcription regulation (Reményi2003Crystal). The primary structure of SOX2 consists of 317 amino acids, with a molecular formula of C1467H2321N443O457S26 and a molecular weight of approximately 34.31 kDa (Zhang2019Bioinformatics). The secondary structure of SOX2 includes a mix of α helices, extended strands, β turns, and random coils, with a significant portion being random coils, indicating its intrinsically disordered nature (Chafiaa2023Structural; Zhang2019Bioinformatics).

The tertiary structure of SOX2 involves the folding of the HMG domain, which facilitates its interaction with DNA. This domain is involved in forming a ternary complex with DNA and other proteins like Oct4, enhancing its DNA-binding affinity (Reményi2003Crystal). SOX2 can form heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, particularly in its interactions with other transcription factors such as Oct4 (Yesudhas2016Structural).

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, play a role in regulating SOX2's interactions and activity, affecting its function in cellular processes (Bouguechtouli2024Structural).

## Function
The SOX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance and function of stem and progenitor cells in various tissues. In healthy human cells, SOX2 is essential for regulating stem cell populations in the brain, retina, trachea, tongue epithelium, hair follicle, and pituitary gland, among others. It is involved in tissue homeostasis and repair, such as controlling the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells in the trachea and promoting Schwann cell dedifferentiation for nerve repair (Sarkar2013The).

SOX2 functions by interacting with other transcription factors, such as Oct4 and Nanog, to sustain the regulatory networks necessary for self-renewal and to suppress differentiation programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). It acts as a pioneer factor, maintaining target genes in a poised state for activation during differentiation (Sarkar2013The). In neural progenitor cells, SOX2 inhibits neuronal differentiation, maintaining progenitor characteristics and multipotency, which is crucial for the development of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (Graham2003SOX2).

SOX2's expression is dose-dependent, and its dysregulation can lead to developmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its critical role in normal cellular functions and organismal development (Sarkar2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOX2 gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders, primarily affecting the eyes, brain, and reproductive system. SOX2 mutations are a common cause of anophthalmia and microphthalmia, conditions characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of one or both eyes. These mutations can also lead to optic nerve hypoplasia, ocular coloboma, and other eye anomalies (Schneider2009Novel; Hagstrom2005SOX2). In addition to ocular defects, SOX2 mutations are linked to systemic abnormalities such as brain malformations, developmental delays, and sensorineural hearing loss (Blackburn2018Extension; Hagstrom2005SOX2).

SOX2 mutations can also affect the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to conditions like idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kelberman2006Mutations; Cassin2023Heterozygous). These mutations may interfere with the transcriptional repression of genes like KISS1, which is involved in reproductive hormone regulation (Cassin2023Heterozygous).

Alterations in SOX2 expression levels have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Alatzoglou2011SOX2). This dual role highlights the complexity of SOX2's involvement in disease.

## Interactions
SOX2 is involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining pluripotency and regulating gene expression. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), SOX2 interacts with OCT4, a key partner in maintaining stem cell identity, although this interaction is not detected in human glioma cells, possibly due to different cellular contexts or low affinity (Fang2011Landscape). SOX2 also associates with several members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, such as HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPA3, and HNRNPK, which are involved in the formation of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, suggesting a role in post-transcriptional regulation (Fang2011Landscape).

SOX2's interactions extend to other proteins involved in DNA repair and RNA helicase activity, with nine members of the DEAD box containing genes identified as part of its interactome (Fang2011Landscape). It also interacts with HDAC1 and HDAC2, using multiple domains for these associations, and can self-associate through its HMG domain (Cox2010Sox2). Post-translational modifications, such as O-GlcNAcylation at serine 248, influence SOX2's interactions and genomic occupancy, affecting its role in pluripotency and reprogramming (Myers2016SOX2). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which SOX2 participates, impacting its function in stemness, reprogramming, and cancer.
