# CALR3

## Overview
The CALR3 gene encodes the protein calreticulin 3, a testis-specific chaperone that plays a pivotal role in male fertility. Unlike other members of the calreticulin family, calreticulin 3 is specialized in its function, primarily facilitating the maturation and proper transport of the sperm membrane protein ADAM3, which is crucial for successful fertilization. This protein is expressed specifically in germ cells during the later stages of spermatogenesis, highlighting its role in the development of sperm fertilizing ability (Ikawa2011Calsperin). The absence of CALR3 results in male infertility due to impaired sperm migration and binding to the zona pellucida, underscoring its essential role in reproductive processes (Ikawa2011Calsperin).

## Function
The CALR3 gene encodes calreticulin-3, a testis-specific chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in sperm fertility. Calreticulin-3 is involved in the maturation of ADAM3, a sperm membrane protein essential for fertilization. This protein is specifically expressed in germ cells and is necessary for the proper transport of ADAM3 to the sperm surface, ensuring its presence in mature sperm. In the absence of CALR3, ADAM3 remains in the secretory pathway, leading to impaired sperm migration and binding to the zona pellucida, which are critical steps for successful fertilization (Ikawa2011Calsperin).

CALR3 is part of the calreticulin family of chaperones, but unlike other members, it does not exhibit broad lectin-like activity. Instead, it has a specific role in associating with ADAM3, highlighting its unique function in spermatogenesis. The protein's expression is haploid-specific and begins post-meiotically, indicating its involvement in the later stages of sperm development (Ikawa2011Calsperin). The absence of CALR3 in knockout models results in male infertility, underscoring its essential role in reproductive processes (Ikawa2011Calsperin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CALR3 gene have been associated with male infertility. Studies have shown that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CALR3, such as 742G>T (Asp248Tyr), 976G>A (Asp326Asn), and 1058A>T (Lys353Met), are more frequent in infertile male patients compared to fertile controls. These SNPs are thought to affect sperm-egg interactions, potentially leading to impaired spermatogenesis and infertility (Irie2011Primary).

Research using Calr3 knockout mice has demonstrated that the absence of CALR3 results in male infertility. Although these mice produce normal-appearing sperm, the sperm exhibit defective migration and binding to the zona pellucida, which is crucial for fertilization. This suggests that CALR3 is essential for the development of sperm fertilizing ability (Ikawa2011Calsperin).

In contrast, the role of CALR3 in cardiomyopathy is less clear. While initial studies suggested a potential link between CALR3 variants and cardiomyopathy, further research has not supported a causal role for CALR3 in monogenic cardiomyopathy. CALR3 is not expressed in myocardial tissues, indicating it is unlikely to contribute to heart muscle disorders (Verhagen2018Lack).

## Interactions
CALR3, a member of the calreticulin family, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It plays a crucial role in the maturation of the sperm membrane protein ADAM3, which is essential for sperm migration and fertilization. CALR3 directly binds to ADAM3, facilitating its proper folding and function (Tokuhiro2015Calreticulin). This interaction is part of a quality control mechanism in the ER, where CALR3, along with PDILT, promotes the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in ADAM3, ensuring its stability and activity (Tokuhiro2012Protein).

CALR3 is also coexpressed with PDILT and CLGN in haploid spermatids, indicating a collaborative role in protein folding and maturation processes specific to male fertility (Tokuhiro2012Protein). Unlike other calreticulin family members, CALR3 does not interact with CANX or CALR, highlighting its unique specificity in protein interactions within the testis (Tokuhiro2012Protein). These interactions underscore CALR3's specialized function in the reproductive system, distinct from the broader roles of other calreticulin proteins.
