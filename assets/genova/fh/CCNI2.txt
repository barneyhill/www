# CCNI2

## Overview
Cyclin I family member 2 (CCNI2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a kinase primarily active in post-mitotic cells. The CCNI2 protein functions as a novel activator of CDK5, influencing its kinase activity and subcellular localization, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and phosphorylation of target proteins (Liu2017Cyclin). Unlike other CDK5 activators, CCNI2 retains CDK5 in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane, affecting its physiological roles (Liu2017Cyclin). Although CCNI2 is not conserved across all species, it is present in humans and chickens, but absent in mice and rats (Liu2017Cyclin). The gene's expression is notably altered in various cancers, where it plays a role in tumor progression and serves as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Hu2024CCNI2; Chen2021CCNI2).

## Function
The CCNI2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a novel activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which is involved in cell cycle regulation. CCNI2 physically interacts with CDK5, activating its kinase activity, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Liu2017Cyclin). Unlike conventional cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK5 is predominantly active in post-mitotic cells and is not directly involved in cell cycle regulation. However, CCNI2's interaction with CDK5 suggests a role in cell cycle progression, as its depletion in HeLa cells leads to an increase in the G1 phase and a decrease in the S phase, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression (Liu2017Cyclin).

CCNI2 influences the subcellular localization of CDK5, retaining it in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane, which contrasts with other CDK5 activators that localize it in the nuclei (Liu2017Cyclin). This localization is significant for its physiological function, as it affects the phosphorylation of target proteins and subsequent cellular outcomes. Despite its role in cell cycle regulation, CCNI2 is not conserved across all species, being absent in mice and rats but present in humans and chickens (Liu2017Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNI2 gene have been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, CCNI2 is significantly overexpressed, contributing to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. This overexpression is associated with poorer overall survival in patients, suggesting that CCNI2 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target. The gene promotes cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell cycle progression and migration (Hu2024CCNI2).

In gastric cancer, CCNI2 is also overexpressed and correlates with advanced pathological stages. Knockdown of CCNI2 in gastric cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased migration. These effects are partly mediated through its interaction with the hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), indicating that CCNI2 may exert its oncogenic effects via HDGF (Chen2021CCNI2).

CCNI2 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, where it promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Its expression is positively correlated with poor prognosis and higher pathological grading in CRC patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target (Lai2021CCNI2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CCNI2 is identified as one of the methylation-driven genes with prognostic significance, further underscoring its role in cancer progression (Li2019Prognostic).

## Interactions
CCNI2, or cyclin I family member 2, is known to interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), acting as a novel activator of this kinase. The interaction between CCNI2 and CDK5 was initially identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is stronger than that between CDK5 and cyclin I (CCNI) (Liu2017Cyclin). CCNI2 enhances CDK5's kinase activity, as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of substrates such as histone H1 and PAK1. The CDK5/CCNI2 complex exhibits stronger activity than the CDK5/CCNI complex but is less active than the CDK5/p35 complex (Liu2017Cyclin).

In the context of cancer, CCNI2 interacts with CDK5 and CDK6 in pancreatic cancer cells, influencing cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown these interactions, suggesting a role for CCNI2 in modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell migration and tumorigenesis (Hu2024CCNI2). In gastric cancer, CCNI2 interacts with the hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), promoting cancer progression. This interaction was validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that CCNI2 may regulate HDGF's role in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Chen2021CCNI2).
