# MAGEC3

## Overview
MAGEC3 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member C3, which is part of the melanoma antigen gene family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cancer progression and immune response modulation. MAGE family member C3 is known to interact with key signaling molecules such as IFNGR1 and STAT1, playing a significant role in the IFN-γ signaling pathway, and with STAT3, influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer cell migration. Additionally, it interacts with E3 ligases in ovarian cancer, affecting the stability of BRCA2 and potentially impacting DNA repair mechanisms. The expression and mutation of MAGEC3 have clinical significance in several cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and kidney cancer, where it serves as a prognostic biomarker and is associated with immune evasion and treatment response (Wu2021MAGE‐C3; Ellegate2021MAGEC3; Omole2022Combined).

## Clinical Significance
The MAGEC3 gene has been implicated in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ovarian cancer, and kidney cancer. In ESCC, MAGEC3 overexpression is associated with cancer metastasis through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immunosuppression. It enhances the interaction between IFNGR1 and STAT1, activating the IFN-γ signaling pathway, which contributes to an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor progression. This overexpression is linked to decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and increased PD-1+ CD8+ T cells, indicating a role in PD-L1-involved immunosuppression (Wu2021MAGE‐C3).

In ovarian and kidney cancers, MAGEC3 serves as a prognostic biomarker. Lower expression levels in renal cell carcinoma are associated with certain racial and histological characteristics. In ovarian cancer, normal MAGEC3 levels correlate with a complete response to treatment. The gene is also linked to stress-related processes and genomic instability, with higher expression correlating with poorer prognosis in some cases (Ellegate2021MAGEC3).

MAGEC3 mutations, such as the missense SNP rs176026, have been associated with early-onset hereditary ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential role in familial cancer risk (Eng2018Paternal).

## Interactions
MAGEC3, a member of the melanoma antigen gene family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression and immune response. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MAGEC3 overexpression enhances the interaction between IFNGR1 and STAT1, components of the IFN-γ signaling pathway, thereby strengthening the signaling process. This interaction occurs both in the presence and absence of IFN-γ, suggesting a role for MAGEC3 in modulating immune responses (Wu2021MAGE‐C3).

MAGEC3 also interacts with STAT3, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. This is evidenced by increased levels of phosphorylated STAT3 in MAGEC3 overexpressing cells, which enhances cell migration and invasion (Wu2021MAGE‐C3). The use of a STAT3-specific inhibitor has been shown to attenuate these effects, indicating the involvement of STAT3 in MAGEC3-mediated EMT (Wu2021MAGE‐C3).

In ovarian cancer, MAGEC3 is suggested to interact with E3 ligases, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of BRCA2, particularly in cells expressing full-length BRCA2 protein. This interaction may influence DNA repair processes and cancer progression (Omole2022Combined).
