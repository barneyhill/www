# RASA3

## Overview
RASA3 is a gene that encodes the RAS p21 protein activator 3, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) primarily involved in the regulation of small GTPases, particularly Rap1 and Ras. The protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways that maintain vascular integrity and endothelial cell adhesion, crucial for normal angiogenesis and hemostasis (MolinaOrtiz2018Rasa3). RASA3 is categorized as a regulatory protein that modulates the activity of GTPases, thereby influencing integrin signaling and platelet function. Its activity is essential in various cell types, including platelets and megakaryocytes, where it prevents unwanted platelet activation and supports proper cell development and differentiation (MolinaOrtiz2014Rasa3; Stefanini2015RASA3). Mutations or dysregulation of RASA3 are linked to hematological disorders and vascular abnormalities, highlighting its significance in maintaining vascular and hematopoietic health (Robledo2020Differential; MolinaOrtiz2018Rasa3).

## Function
The RASA3 gene encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that primarily regulates the activity of the small GTPase Rap1, although it also targets Ras. In healthy human cells, RASA3 plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular integrity and endothelial cell adhesion through a Rap1-dependent mechanism. It is involved in controlling the turnover of endothelial cell adhesion and maintaining vascular lumen integrity, which is essential for normal angiogenic processes (MolinaOrtiz2018Rasa3).

RASA3 is active in the plasma membrane of circulating platelets, where it acts as a critical inhibitor of Rap1-dependent platelet activation. This regulation is vital for preventing unwanted platelet activation and maintaining platelet homeostasis, thereby ensuring normal hemostatic function (Stefanini2015RASA3).

In megakaryocytes, RASA3 regulates Rap1 activation and integrin signaling, which are essential for proper megakaryocyte development, adherence, migration, and differentiation into proplatelet-forming cells. The loss of RASA3 function results in increased active Rap1 levels and constitutive integrin activation, leading to severe thrombocytopenia and other hematopoietic abnormalities (MolinaOrtiz2014Rasa3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RASA3 gene are associated with several hematological disorders and vascular abnormalities. In mouse models, catalytic inactivation of RASA3 leads to severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding, anemia, and a predisposition to preleukemia, characterized by increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and splenomegaly (MolinaOrtiz2014Rasa3). These conditions are linked to increased levels of active Rap1 and constitutive integrin activation, which disrupts normal megakaryocyte development and function (MolinaOrtiz2014Rasa3).

RASA3 mutations also result in severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, as seen in the scat mouse model, which exhibits hemorrhage and cranial bleeding due to impaired endothelial cell adhesion and vessel development (Robledo2020Differential). The gene's role in maintaining vascular integrity is further highlighted by its involvement in endothelial cell adhesion and vascular lumen integrity, with inactivation leading to occluded blood vessels (MolinaOrtiz2018Rasa3).

RASA3 may act as a tumor suppressor, as its expression is downregulated in various cancer cells, suggesting potential therapeutic implications as an anti-angiogenic target in cancer treatment (MolinaOrtiz2018Rasa3). The gene's dysfunction can lead to bone marrow failure and ineffective stress erythropoiesis, emphasizing its critical role in blood formation and vascular health (Robledo2020Differential).

## Interactions
RASA3, also known as RAS p21 protein activator 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. RASA3 interacts with the small GTPase Rap1, playing a significant role in regulating its activity. This interaction is essential for maintaining endothelial cell adhesion and vascular integrity, as RASA3 controls Rap1 activation, which is crucial for integrin and cadherin-mediated adhesion dynamics (MolinaOrtiz2018Rasa3).

In platelets, RASA3 is a major binder of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and is involved in integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. It regulates Rap1 activity, which is critical for platelet function and cell spreading. The interaction between RASA3 and PI3K influences its membrane localization and activity, affecting platelet activation and thrombosis (Battram2017The).

RASA3 also interacts with the Cbl proto-oncogene-b (Cbl-b), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the degradation of the IRF4 protein through poly-ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of IRF4 stability during the generation of pathogenic T helper 17 (pTh17) cells (Wu2018RAS).
