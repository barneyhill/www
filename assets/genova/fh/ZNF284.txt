# ZNF284

## Overview
ZNF284 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 284, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role as a transcription factor. The protein is distinguished by its multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and a KRAB domain that is involved in transcriptional repression. These structural features enable ZNF284 to regulate gene expression, influencing critical cellular processes such as differentiation and development. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, liver, pancreas, and thymus, but is absent in others like the brain and skeletal muscle, indicating tissue-specific functions. ZNF284's involvement in transcriptional regulation has also been linked to its potential role in cancer prognosis, particularly in bladder carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it may serve as a biomarker for adverse clinical outcomes (Yin2006Cloning; Liu2020Identification; MuñozBello2024Potential).

## Structure
ZNF284 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. The primary structure of ZNF284 includes multiple cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate with zinc ions to form stable zinc finger motifs. These motifs follow the consensus sequence Cx2-4Cx12Hx3-5H, which is typical for C2H2-type zinc fingers (Yin2006Cloning).

The secondary structure of ZNF284 likely consists of beta sheets and alpha helices, as is common in zinc finger proteins. These structural elements facilitate the interaction of the zinc fingers with the major groove of DNA, allowing the protein to function as a transcription factor (Pavletich1991Zinc).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these zinc finger domains into a compact, globular conformation, stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions. This folding is essential for the protein's DNA-binding capability (Pavletich1991Zinc).

ZNF284 does not typically form quaternary structures, as zinc finger proteins generally function as monomers. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its stability and function. Alternative splicing of ZNF284 can result in different mRNA isoforms, potentially leading to diverse functional properties (Shannon2003Differential).

## Function
ZNF284 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It contains a KRAB domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression, and eleven C2H2 zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding (Yin2006Cloning). The KRAB domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is divided into subfamilies based on the presence of KRAB A and B motifs, with the A box being essential for repressor activity (Yin2006Cloning).

In healthy human cells, ZNF284 is implicated in transcriptional regulation, influencing cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development. The protein's regulatory role is thought to stabilize lineage commitment during cellular differentiation, which is vital for maintaining proper cell function and organismal development (Yin2006Cloning). ZNF284 is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, liver, pancreas, and thymus, but is notably absent in the brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting tissue-specific functions (Yin2006Cloning). The localization of ZNF284 in the nucleus aligns with its role in modulating the expression of target genes, thereby impacting organismal development and homeostasis (Yin2006Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF284, a member of the zinc finger protein family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in transcription regulation. In early-stage bladder carcinoma (BLCA), ZNF284 is part of a 17-gene signature identified as an independent prognostic factor for patient survival. This gene is associated with high-risk scores, indicating a potential link to poorer outcomes in BLCA patients (Liu2020Identification). The study suggests that ZNF284, along with other genes in the signature, can stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, aiding in prognosis and treatment strategies (Liu2020Identification).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZNF284 is associated with poor survival in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients. This finding highlights its potential role as a biomarker for adverse clinical outcomes in HPV-positive HNSCC (MuñozBello2024Potential). Despite these associations, the specific clinical significance of ZNF284 mutations or their direct impact on disease mechanisms remains less clear, as the gene has not been extensively studied in cancer research prior to these findings (Liu2020Identification).
