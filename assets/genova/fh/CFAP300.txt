# CFAP300

## Overview
The CFAP300 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 300, which is integral to the assembly and function of ciliary dynein arms. These arms are essential for the motility of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a critical role in movement and signaling. The CFAP300 protein functions as a dynein arm preassembly factor, facilitating the transport of dynein components to motile cilia, thereby ensuring proper ciliary function (Schultz2022CFAP300; Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). Mutations in the CFAP300 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder that results in impaired ciliary function and associated clinical symptoms such as chronic respiratory infections and situs inversus (Schultz2022CFAP300; Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). The gene's expression is upregulated during ciliogenesis, highlighting its critical role in the assembly process of dynein arms and the maintenance of normal ciliary structure and function (Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:).

## Function
The CFAP300 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of ciliary dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of cilia. In healthy human cells, CFAP300 is involved in the preassembly of dynein arms in the cytoplasm and their subsequent transport to the cilium, where they contribute to the proper functioning of cilia (Schultz2022CFAP300). The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm but is also found in the ciliary matrix, suggesting its role in dynein arms transport within the axoneme (Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). 

CFAP300 is necessary for the assembly and function of dynein arms, and its absence leads to ciliary dysfunction, as observed in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients (Schultz2022CFAP300). The gene's expression is upregulated during ciliogenesis, indicating its involvement in the assembly process of dynein arms (Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). CFAP300's role in ciliary function is further supported by its interaction with other proteins involved in dynein arms assembly, such as DNAAF2, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal ciliary structure and function (Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP300 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. This condition leads to chronic respiratory infections, sinusitis, otitis media, and bronchiectasis due to defective mucociliary clearance. PCD can also result in situs inversus, a condition where the symmetry of visceral organs is reversed, occurring in about 50% of PCD patients (Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). 

A specific frameshift mutation, c.198_200delinsCC, has been identified in Finnish and Slavic populations, leading to a premature stop codon and truncated CFAP300 protein. This mutation results in the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in cilia, crucial for their motility, and is not found in the general population, suggesting a population-specific occurrence (Schultz2022CFAP300; Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). 

The CFAP300 gene is also involved in the trafficking of dynein arm components, and its mutations lead to mislocalization of these components, further impairing ciliary function (Zietkiewicz2019CFAP300:). The gene's role in ciliary assembly and function underscores its clinical significance in diagnosing and understanding PCD (Schultz2022CFAP300).

## Interactions
The CFAP300 protein is implicated in the assembly and transport of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary function. It is suggested to function as a dynein arm preassembly factor, facilitating the transport of these components to motile cilia. In Finnish patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the CFAP300 gene results in the absence of dynein arms in cilia, indicating a disruption in its interaction with dynein arm proteins such as DNAH7, DNAI1, and DNAH5 (Schultz2022CFAP300).

Immunofluorescence studies have shown that CFAP300 is transported to the cilium in control cells, but this transport is disrupted in patients with the CFAP300 mutation, suggesting a role in the physical interaction and transport of dynein arm components (Schultz2022CFAP300). The presence of radial spoke protein RSPH4A in patient cilia, despite the absence of dynein arms, suggests potential interactions between CFAP300 and radial spoke proteins, although the exact nature of these interactions requires further study (Schultz2022CFAP300). The study does not provide specific information on interactions with nucleic acids (Schultz2022CFAP300).
