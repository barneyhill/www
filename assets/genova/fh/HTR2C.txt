# HTR2C

## Overview
The HTR2C gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5-HT2C), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonin and dopamine. The 5-HT2C receptor modulates various physiological processes, including anxiety, feeding behavior, and energy balance, by influencing serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. It is known for its ability to undergo alternative splicing and RNA editing, which results in multiple receptor isoforms with distinct signaling properties. The receptor's interactions, particularly its heterodimerization with the 5-HT2A receptor, contribute to unique intracellular signaling pathways that have implications for neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders. Genetic polymorphisms and mutations in the HTR2C gene are associated with conditions such as major depression, schizophrenia, and obesity, underscoring its clinical significance (Fongang2019Coevolution; Stamm2017The; He2022Human).

## Structure
The HTR2C gene encodes the serotonin receptor 2C (5HT2C), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs (Stamm2017The). The primary structure of the receptor includes sequences that form these transmembrane domains, which are likely organized into alpha-helices in the secondary structure (Stamm2017The). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, facilitating ligand binding and interaction with G proteins (Stamm2017The). The receptor can form dimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, with interactions occurring between transmembrane regions 1, 4, and 5 (Stamm2017The).

The 5HT2C receptor undergoes alternative splicing and RNA editing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including a full-length receptor (5HT2C_FL) and a truncated receptor (5HT2C_tr) (Stamm2017The). The full-length receptor contains a PDZ-ligand motif in its C-terminus, which is important for binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins (Stamm2017The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and palmitoylation are common in GPCRs, although specific modifications for 5HT2C are not detailed in the provided context (Stamm2017The). RNA editing affects the receptor's G-protein coupling affinity and trafficking properties, with edited receptors showing decreased constitutive activity (Stamm2017The).

## Function
The HTR2C gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5-HT2C), a G protein-coupled receptor primarily active in the central nervous system. This receptor is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonin and dopamine. The 5-HT2C receptor modulates dopaminergic circuitry by mediating the inhibitory effects of serotonin on dopaminergic neurons, which affects dopamine release in the brain (Mickey2012Striatal). It exerts an inhibitory control over dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area through GABAergic neurons, influencing the balance between serotonergic and dopaminergic systems (Giorgetti2004Contributions).

The receptor is involved in the regulation of anxiety, feeding behavior, and energy balance. It plays a role in anorexinergic pathways, affecting food intake and energy homeostasis (Drago2009Focus). In terms of anxiety, inhibition of 5-HT2C receptors has been shown to reduce anxiety effects, with knockout models exhibiting blunted anxiety-like behavior (Heisler2007Serotonin). The receptor's activity is modulated by RNA editing, which alters its signaling characteristics and affects its role in various behaviors and physiological processes (Kleene2015Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HTR2C gene, which encodes the serotonin 2C receptor, are associated with a range of neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders. The Cys23Ser polymorphism in the HTR2C gene is linked to several psychiatric conditions, including major depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia. This variant is also associated with altered responses to antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics, potentially affecting receptor pharmacology and contributing to increased sensitivity to drug-associated cues in cocaine users (Land2019Serotonin; Chagraoui20165HT2C).

In terms of metabolic conditions, the Ser23 allele of the Cys23Ser polymorphism is overrepresented in women with low BMI, suggesting a role in body weight regulation. This allele may lead to higher constitutive activity of the 5-HT2C receptor, exerting an inhibitory influence on food intake (Bah2010Further). Rare variants in the HTR2C gene, such as F327L, have been associated with severe obesity and maladaptive behaviors, including hyperphagia and anxiety-related disorders. These variants often result in a loss of function in the receptor, affecting serotonin binding and receptor signaling pathways (He2022Human).

The HTR2C gene is also implicated in Prader-Willi Syndrome, where alterations in receptor splicing and expression contribute to hyperphagia and obesity (Garfield2016Increased). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both psychiatric and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
The HTR2C gene encodes the 5-HT2C receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. This receptor is known to form a functional heterodimer with the 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays. These interactions occur in both intracellular and extracellular domains, with significant interactions identified between the EC1 domain of 5-HT2AR and the IC3 domain of 5-HT2CR (Fongang2019Coevolution; Fongang2019Protein). The heterodimerization of 5-HT2C with 5-HT2A is implicated in unique intracellular signaling pathways distinct from those activated by the individual receptors, potentially contributing to substance use disorders (Fongang2019Coevolution; Fongang2019Protein).

The interaction between these receptors is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, such as the rs6318 SNP in the HTR2C gene, which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders (Fongang2019Protein). The coexpression of HTR2A and HTR2C in the central nervous system, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, supports their functional interaction and relevance to neuropsychiatric conditions (Fongang2019Coevolution; Fongang2019Protein).
