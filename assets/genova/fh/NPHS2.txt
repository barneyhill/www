# NPHS2

## Overview
The NPHS2 gene encodes podocin, a crucial integral membrane protein belonging to the stomatin family, which plays a vital role in kidney function. Podocin is predominantly expressed in the podocytes of the glomerular filtration barrier, where it is localized at the slit diaphragm, a critical component for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the filtration barrier (Bierzynska2015Genes). As a transmembrane protein, podocin interacts with other key proteins such as nephrin and CD2AP to form multimeric signaling complexes essential for actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell survival (Bierzynska2015Genes). Mutations in the NPHS2 gene can lead to nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria and edema, underscoring the gene's significance in renal health and disease (Bierzynska2015Genes).

## Structure
Podocin, encoded by the NPHS2 gene, is a 383 amino acid integral membrane protein crucial for kidney function, particularly in the slit diaphragm of podocyte foot processes. It is homologous to stomatin and forms a hairpin-like structure (Tabassum2014Structural). The primary structure of podocin includes a conserved stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK (SPFH) domain. Its secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its hairpin-like tertiary conformation (Tabassum2014Structural).

Podocin oligomerizes exclusively through its C-terminal tail, with specific oligomerization sites identified between residues 273-313 and 332-348. These sites correspond to the H1 domain and the H2-H3 linker and H3 helix, respectively, and are crucial for its function and interallelic interactions (Stráner2018Cterminal). The oligomerization of podocin is independent of raft-association and does not require eukaryote-specific post-translational modifications (Stráner2018Cterminal). The protein functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure (Stráner2018Cterminal).

Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, such as R229Q, can affect podocin's conformation and function, highlighting the importance of its intact structure for nephrin transport and podocyte signaling (Stráner2018Cterminal; Tabassum2014Structural).

## Function
The NPHS2 gene encodes podocin, an integral membrane protein that is crucial for kidney function, specifically within the podocytes of the glomerular filtration barrier. Podocin is localized at the slit diaphragm, a key component of the filtration barrier in the glomerulus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of this barrier (Bierzynska2015Genes). It interacts with other proteins such as nephrin (NPHS1) and CD2AP to form multimeric signaling complexes. These complexes are essential for coordinating actin remodeling, cell survival, and endocytosis, which are vital processes for maintaining the integrity of the podocyte cytoskeleton and the filtration barrier (Bierzynska2015Genes).

Podocin's role in the slit diaphragm is critical for ensuring selective permeability, preventing proteinuria, and maintaining kidney homeostasis. Mutations in NPHS2 can disrupt these functions, leading to nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema (Bierzynska2015Genes). The protein's activity is essential for the proper functioning of the glomerular filtration barrier, highlighting its importance in kidney health and disease prevention (Bierzynska2015Genes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, which encodes the protein podocin, are primarily associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), a condition characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and often progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Rood2019Nephrotic; Tory2014Mutationdependent). These mutations are a significant cause of congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) and infantile nephrotic syndrome (INS), with onset typically occurring before the age of six (Bouchireb2013NPHS2Mutations; Hinkes2007Nephrotic). 

The R229Q variant of NPHS2 is common in European populations and is associated with an increased risk of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), though it does not cause disease on its own. Its pathogenicity is dependent on the presence of another NPHS2 mutation (Tory2014Mutationdependent; Franceschini2006NPHS2). 

NPHS2 mutations are less common in adult-onset FSGS, but when present, they often involve compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations (Tonna2008NPHS2variation). The presence of NPHS2 mutations can influence treatment decisions, as patients with these mutations typically do not respond to corticosteroid treatment and have a low risk of disease recurrence after kidney transplantation (Bouchireb2013NPHS2Mutations).

## Interactions
Podocin, encoded by the NPHS2 gene, is a critical component of the glomerular slit diaphragm in kidney podocytes. It interacts with several proteins to maintain the structural integrity and function of the slit diaphragm. Podocin forms oligomers in lipid rafts and interacts with nephrin and CD2AP, which are essential for the filtration function of the kidney. The COOH-terminal domain of podocin specifically associates with nephrin and CD2AP, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down studies (Schwarz2001Podocin).

Podocin's interaction with nephrin is crucial for recruiting nephrin into lipid raft microdomains, which is necessary for nephrin signaling. Mutations in NPHS2, such as R138Q and R138X, disrupt this recruitment, leading to impaired nephrin signaling and contributing to nephrotic syndrome (Huber2003Molecular). Podocin also interacts with NEPH1, a protein related to nephrin, enhancing nephrin-induced signaling. This interaction involves a conserved podocin-binding motif in NEPH1 (Sellin2002NEPH1).

Podocin's interactions are not limited to nephrin and CD2AP; it also forms complexes with other proteins, such as those involved in ubiquitylation and degradation pathways, highlighting its role in podocyte function and stability (Rinschen2016The).
