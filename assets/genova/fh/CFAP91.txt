# CFAP91

## Overview
CFAP91 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 91, a critical component involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. This protein is predominantly expressed in the pituitary and testis, with significant roles in sperm cell differentiation and function. As a part of the calmodulin-associated and spoke-associated complex (CSC), CFAP91 is essential for the proper assembly and stability of the axonemal structures, particularly in sperm flagella. It interacts with various proteins, including SPAG6, RSPH1, and RSP3, to maintain the morphology and motility of flagella. Mutations in the CFAP91 gene are linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), leading to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility and structural defects (Martinez2020Biallelic; Wu2024CCDC113; Bicka2022Cfap91Dependent).

## Function
The CFAP91 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. This protein is primarily expressed in the pituitary and testis, with significant detection in the human sperm proteome, indicating its involvement in sperm cell differentiation and function (Martinez2020Biallelic). CFAP91 is associated with the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella, being present in the central pair complex and radial spokes of sperm cells. It helps maintain normal flagellar morphology and function, as evidenced by its interaction with proteins like SPAG6 and RSPH1, which are uniformly present throughout the flagellum (Martinez2020Biallelic).

In the context of sperm cells, CFAP91 is crucial for the docking of radial spokes, particularly RS2 and RS3, to the axoneme, which is essential for the transduction of regulatory signals from the central apparatus to the dynein arms (Bicka2022Cfap91Dependent). This interaction is vital for maintaining the stability and proper assembly of ciliary structures, ensuring effective sperm motility and structure. Pathogenic mutations in CFAP91 can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), resulting in male infertility (Wu2024CCDC113).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP91 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), a condition that leads to severe astheno-teratozoospermia and male infertility. This condition is characterized by reduced sperm motility and structural abnormalities in the sperm flagella, including disorganized axonemes and the absence of the central pair complex (CPC) (Martinez2020Biallelic). Specific biallelic variants, such as a splice variant c.682+1G>A and a missense variant c.124G>C; p.(Asp42His), have been identified in patients with MMAF, affecting mRNA splicing and leading to truncated proteins (Martinez2020Biallelic).

The CFAP91 protein is crucial for the assembly and stability of radial spokes within the sperm flagellum, which are essential for normal motility. Its absence results in axonemal disorganization, contributing to the MMAF phenotype (Martinez2020Biallelic). CFAP91 interacts with other proteins, such as WDR66, within the calmodulin-associated and spoke-associated complex (CSC), and disruptions in these interactions can lead to severe flagellar malformations (Martinez2020Biallelic). While CFAP91 is linked to MMAF, its role in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is not well-documented, although it is involved in ciliary function (Graziani2024Genetic).

## Interactions
CFAP91, encoded by the MAATS1 gene, is a crucial component of the calmodulin-associated and spoke-associated complex (CSC) involved in flagellar motility. It interacts with several proteins within the axoneme, a structure essential for the function of cilia and flagella. CFAP91 interacts with radial spoke protein 3 (RSP3), which is vital for the assembly and stability of radial spokes in the axoneme. RSP3 anchors the radial spoke complex to the microtubule and the CSC, highlighting the importance of CFAP91 in maintaining axonemal integrity (Martinez2020Biallelic).

CFAP91 also interacts with other CSC components, such as FAP61 (c20orf26) and FAP251 (WDR66), located at the base of RS3. These interactions are crucial for the structural organization of the axoneme, as the absence of CFAP91 leads to destabilization of the radial spoke structure and the central pair complex (CPC), resulting in severe axonemal disorganization (Martinez2020Biallelic).

In addition, CFAP91 is involved in a complex with CCDC113, which acts as an adaptor protein connecting radial spokes, the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the sperm axoneme. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity of the sperm axoneme and proper sperm function (Wu2024CCDC113).
