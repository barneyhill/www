# C5AR1

## Overview
C5AR1 is a gene that encodes the complement C5a receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune response. This receptor is primarily expressed on immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, where it mediates the effects of the complement component C5a, a potent inflammatory peptide. The C5AR1 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of the GPCR family, and is involved in various signaling pathways that lead to immune responses, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytokine release. The receptor's activation involves coupling with the Gαi subtype of heterotrimeric G proteins, resulting in downstream signaling events crucial for immune modulation (Feng2023Mechanism; Pandey2020Emerging). C5AR1's role extends beyond immune function, as it is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to inflammation and disease progression (Lawal2021PanCancer; Carvalho2022Modulation).

## Structure
The C5AR1 protein, also known as complement C5a receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of the GPCR family. These helices form the core transmembrane region, which is conserved among class A GPCRs, including specific motifs like the PIF and NPXXY motifs (SantosLópez2023Structural). The receptor's structure includes an extracellular N-terminal region, intracellular and extracellular loops, and an intracellular C-terminal region (SantosLópez2023Structural).

C5AR1 features a sodium-binding site within its structure, which plays a role in ligand binding and receptor activation (Pandey2020Emerging). The receptor also contains a conserved disulfide bond on the extracellular side and an intrahelical sodium coordination site (SantosLópez2023Structural). Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, tyrosine sulfation, and serine phosphorylation are present, influencing receptor function and signaling (SantosLópez2023Structural).

C5AR1 can form homodimers and heterodimers with other receptors, indicating a quaternary structure that may play a role in its functional regulation (SantosLópez2023Structural). The receptor's ability to oligomerize suggests potential functional or regulatory roles in its signaling pathways (SantosLópez2023Structural).

## Function
C5AR1, or complement C5a receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in the immune response by mediating the effects of the complement component C5a, a potent inflammatory peptide. Upon binding to C5a, C5AR1 activates signaling pathways that lead to various immune responses, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytokine release. This receptor is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, where it contributes to the proinflammatory response (Feng2023Mechanism; Pandey2020Emerging).

C5AR1 functions through coupling with the Gαi subtype of heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to the inhibition of cAMP levels and mobilization of intracellular calcium ions. This activation results in the recruitment of β-arrestins, which facilitate receptor internalization and modulate downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Pandey2019Partial; Pandey2020Emerging).

The receptor's activation is characterized by significant structural rearrangements, particularly in the transmembrane domains, which facilitate the creation of a cytoplasmic cavity for G protein coupling. These structural changes are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and immune response modulation (Feng2023Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
C5AR1, or complement C5a receptor 1, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in immune and inflammatory responses. In cancer, high expression of C5AR1 is linked to chemotherapy resistance in breast, ovarian, colorectal, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancers. It is also associated with poor outcomes in immune checkpoint therapies, such as PD1+CTLA4 therapy in melanoma and PD1 therapy in GBM and kidney cancer (Lawal2021PanCancer). Genetic alterations, including mutations and copy number variations, in C5AR1 are associated with immune evasion and therapy resistance in multiple cancer types (Lawal2021PanCancer).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), C5AR1 signaling is implicated in neuroinflammation and disease progression. Ablation of C5AR1 in mouse models has been shown to delay cognitive decline and reduce inflammatory responses, suggesting that C5AR1 contributes to the detrimental inflammatory environment in AD (Hernandez2017Prevention; Carvalho2022Modulation). The modulation of C5AR1 signaling affects microglial and astrocyte activation, which are key players in AD pathology (Carvalho2022Modulation). These findings indicate that targeting C5AR1 could be a therapeutic strategy in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
C5AR1, also known as complement C5a receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in immune response and inflammation. It primarily binds to the complement component C5a, a potent inflammatory molecule, leading to the activation of signaling pathways that involve G-proteins, particularly the Gαi subtype (Saha2023Structural). Upon activation by C5a, C5AR1 undergoes conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with G-proteins, β-arrestins, and other signaling molecules (SantosLópez2023Structural).

C5AR1 also forms heteromers with another complement receptor, C5L2, in the presence of C5a, but not with its derivative C5a-des Arg. This interaction is suggested to regulate anti-inflammatory cytokines during high complement activation conditions, such as sepsis (Croker2013C5a). The receptor's interaction with β-arrestins is crucial for receptor internalization and desensitization, which are important for modulating receptor activity and downstream signaling (SantosLópez2023Structural).

In osteoblasts, C5AR1 interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), leading to the activation of p38 MAPK and the expression of the chemokine CXCL10, which is involved in osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone conditions (Mödinger2018C5aR1). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in both immune and bone metabolism processes.
