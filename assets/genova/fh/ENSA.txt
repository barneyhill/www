# ENSA

## Overview
The ENSA gene encodes the protein endosulfine alpha, which is a key regulatory component in cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle progression and mitosis. Endosulfine alpha is categorized as a regulatory protein that plays a significant role in the Greatwall/Ensa/PP2A-B55 signaling pathway, crucial for mitotic entry and progression. It functions by inhibiting the phosphatase PP2A-B55, thereby maintaining the phosphorylation state of cyclin B-Cdk1 substrates, which is essential for mitotic events (Charrasse2017Ensa). Additionally, endosulfine alpha is involved in the recruitment of Aurora A kinase to spindle poles, ensuring proper spindle assembly and chromosome alignment during mitosis (Kim2023Endosulfine). Beyond its role in cell division, endosulfine alpha interacts with α-synuclein, preventing its aggregation, which is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (Ysselstein2017Endosulfinealpha). The multifaceted functions of endosulfine alpha underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease pathogenesis.

## Function
ENSA (endosulfine alpha) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly during the S phase and mitosis in human cells. ENSA is part of the Greatwall/Ensa/PP2A-B55 pathway, which is essential for controlling mitotic substrate phosphorylation and mitotic entry. During the S phase, ENSA stabilizes Treslin, a key protein for the initiation of DNA replication, by preventing its degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This stabilization is critical for the proper firing of replication origins, ensuring timely S-phase progression (Charrasse2017Ensa).

ENSA is phosphorylated by the Greatwall kinase, which enhances its ability to inhibit the phosphatase PP2A-B55. This inhibition is necessary for maintaining the phosphorylation of cyclin B-Cdk1 substrates, facilitating mitotic entry and progression (Charrasse2017Ensa). In mitosis, phosphorylated ENSA is concentrated at the spindle poles, where it recruits Aurora A, a kinase essential for spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, thus maintaining spindle pole integrity (Kim2023Endosulfine). ENSA's activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its importance in cellular division and genomic stability (Charrasse2017Ensa).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ENSA gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. ENSA is known to inhibit membrane-induced aggregation of α-synuclein, a process associated with neurotoxicity in conditions like Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Studies have shown that ENSA levels are reduced in the brains of patients with these synucleinopathy disorders, suggesting that down-regulation of ENSA may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by impairing its neuroprotective effects against α-synuclein toxicity (Ysselstein2017Endosulfinealpha).

In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), ENSA acts as a negative regulator of neprilysin (NEP), an enzyme involved in the degradation of amyloid-beta peptides. ENSA deficiency in knockout mice leads to increased NEP activity and reduced amyloid-beta levels, indicating that ENSA may play a role in amyloid-beta accumulation, a hallmark of AD pathology. Elevated ENSA levels have been observed in the cortices and hippocampi of AD patients, suggesting its involvement in AD etiology (Watamura2021Somatostatinevoked).

ENSA is also involved in cancer biology, particularly in the regulation of the MASTL-ENSA-PP2A axis. While ENSA overexpression does not lead to a proliferative phenotype in most cell types, its interaction with MASTL can contribute to cancer progression by inhibiting the tumor suppressor activity of PP2A-B55 (Marzec2018The).

## Interactions
Endosulfine alpha (ENSA) is involved in several critical protein interactions. During mitosis, ENSA plays a crucial role in maintaining spindle pole integrity by recruiting Aurora A kinase to the spindle poles. This interaction is facilitated by the phosphorylation of ENSA, which is essential for the localization of Aurora A at the spindle poles, as demonstrated by the use of a MASTL kinase inhibitor, MKI-2, which reduces phosphorylated Aurora A at these sites (Kim2023Endosulfine). The interaction between phosphorylated ENSA and Aurora A was confirmed using a proximal ligation assay, highlighting its importance during prometaphase and metaphase (Kim2023Endosulfine).

ENSA also interacts with α-synuclein (aSyn) at membrane surfaces, where it inhibits membrane-induced aSyn aggregation. This interaction is specific to membrane-bound aSyn and is disrupted by the S109E variant of ENSA, which mimics phosphorylation and reduces its binding affinity. ENSA's interaction with aSyn is significant in preventing the formation of toxic aSyn oligomers, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (Ysselstein2017Endosulfinealpha).
