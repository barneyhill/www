# ATXN1

## Overview
The ATXN1 gene encodes the protein ataxin-1, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing within the nucleus of human cells. Ataxin-1 is characterized by a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and an AXH domain, which are critical for its structural integrity and functional interactions. The protein plays a significant role in modulating gene expression and is implicated in various cellular processes, including extracellular matrix remodeling and the Notch signaling pathway. Mutations in the ATXN1 gene, particularly expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeat, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disorder. This mutation results in a toxic gain of function of the ataxin-1 protein, leading to its accumulation in the nuclei of cerebellar Purkinje cells and subsequent neurodegeneration (Rocha2019ATXN1; Zoghbi2009Pathogenic).

## Structure
The ATXN1 protein is characterized by a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract located at the N-terminal region, spanning residues 197-225. In the wild-type form, this tract consists of 4 to 36 repeats, while in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patients, it expands to 38 to 83 repeats (Rocha2019ATXN1). The polyQ tract is predicted to be a random coil in the wild-type form, but in the expanded form, it adopts a structure of three α-helices connected by loops (Rocha2019ATXN1).

The AXH domain, a key structural feature of ATXN1, spans residues 562-693 and is crucial for protein-protein interactions, including self-association and interactions with other proteins like Capicua (CIC) and RNA-binding motif protein 17 (RBM17) (Kim2013Structural; Kim2014Structural). The AXH domain forms an asymmetric homodimer and is involved in the modulation of disease development and aggregation processes (Grasso2015Conformational).

Post-translational modifications play significant roles in ATXN1's function. Phosphorylation at serine 776 is critical for interactions with RBM17, forming a phospho-specific interaction through a salt-bridge network (Kim2014Structural). Other modifications include ubiquitination and sumoylation, which influence ATXN1 aggregation and activity (Rocha2019ATXN1). The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at residues 794-797, essential for nuclear transport (Rocha2019ATXN1).

## Function
The ATXN1 gene encodes the protein ataxin-1, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing in healthy human cells. Ataxin-1 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it interacts with various transcription factors and cofactors, including Capicua (CIC) and LANP, to modulate gene expression (Tong2011Ataxin‐1). It is involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, particularly in the cerebellum, by influencing the expression of its regulatory subunits and inhibitors, such as Pp2a-b and Anp32a (Sánchez2013A). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance of PP2A activity, which affects downstream signaling pathways important for cellular functions (Sánchez2013A).

Ataxin-1 also participates in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, a process essential for development and tissue maintenance. It forms complexes with ATXN1L and CIC to regulate the expression of genes involved in ECM remodeling, which is critical for normal lung development and preventing defects such as emphysema (Lee2011ATXN1). Additionally, ataxin-1 is implicated in the Notch signaling pathway, where it acts as a transcriptional corepressor, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation (Tong2011Ataxin‐1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATXN1 gene, particularly the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat, are the primary cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disorder. This expansion leads to the production of a mutant ataxin-1 protein with an elongated polyglutamine tract, resulting in a toxic gain of function that disrupts normal cellular processes. The mutant protein accumulates in the nuclei of cerebellar Purkinje cells, leading to their degeneration and the characteristic symptoms of SCA1, such as loss of motor coordination and speech difficulties (MatillaDueñas2008Clinical; Zoghbi2009Pathogenic).

The pathogenesis of SCA1 involves both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms. The expanded polyglutamine tract in ataxin-1 enhances its interaction with various proteins, such as transcription factors and splicing regulators, altering their stability and function. These interactions contribute to the selective vulnerability of Purkinje cells (Rocha2019ATXN1; Zoghbi2009Pathogenic). Additionally, the nuclear localization of mutant ataxin-1 is crucial for its toxicity, as demonstrated by studies showing that restricting the protein to the cytoplasm prevents the development of pathology (Klement1998Ataxin1). The disease also exhibits anticipation, where the CAG repeat expansion leads to earlier onset and increased severity in successive generations (Zoghbi2009Pathogenic).

## Interactions
Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) is involved in a complex network of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its function and the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). ATXN1 interacts with several transcriptional regulators, including Capicua (CIC), SMRT, Gfi-1, and RORa/Tip-60, which are important for its role in gene transcription (de2013ProteinProtein; Chen2022Identification). The AXH domain of ATXN1 is particularly significant, as it mediates interactions with CIC, forming a heterotetramer complex that is essential for transcriptional regulation (Kim2013Structural; de2013ProteinProtein).

ATXN1 also interacts with RNA-binding proteins and is involved in RNA metabolism. It recruits the mRNA export factor TAP/NXF1 and interacts with splicing factors such as RBM9/FOX2 and U2AF65, affecting mRNA processing and export (de2014Kaleidoscopic). The phosphorylation state of ATXN1 influences its interactions, with non-phosphorylated ATXN1 interacting with spliceosomal factors and phosphorylated ATXN1 interacting with 14-3-3 proteins (de2014Kaleidoscopic).

In HEK-293T cells, ATXN1 interacts with proteins such as GNAS, MCM2, and TMEM206, although these interactions are disrupted in the mutant form of ATXN1 due to nuclear aggregation (Chen2022Identification). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ATXN1 in cellular processes and its contribution to the pathology of SCA1.
