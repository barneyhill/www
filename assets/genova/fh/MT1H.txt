# MT1H

## Overview
MT1H, or metallothionein 1H, is a gene that encodes a member of the metallothionein family of proteins, which are characterized by their ability to bind heavy metal ions through cysteine-rich domains. The protein product, metallothionein 1H, plays a critical role in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, particularly involving zinc and copper ions. It is involved in cellular processes such as antioxidant defense and the regulation of metal-dependent enzymes, contributing to the protection against oxidative stress and apoptosis. MT1H is also implicated in various signaling pathways, including NF-kappa B, Jak-STAT, and Wnt, which are essential for cellular growth and survival. Clinically, MT1H has been identified as a tumor suppressor, with its expression often downregulated in cancers such as prostate and liver cancer due to promoter hypermethylation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2017Metallothionein; Han2013Metallothionein; Zhang2021Integrative).

## Function
MT1H (metallothionein 1H) is a protein involved in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, primarily binding heavy metals such as zinc and copper. This binding activity plays a crucial role in metal ion metabolism and protection against metal toxicity. MT1H is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it contributes to cellular antioxidant defense and the regulation of metal-dependent enzymes (Zhang2021Integrative).

In healthy human cells, MT1H is involved in maintaining zinc and copper homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. The protein's ability to bind and sequester metal ions helps protect cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis, thereby supporting cellular health and function (Zhang2021Integrative).

MT1H also plays a role in modulating cellular responses to zinc and cadmium ions, which are important for the negative regulation of growth and cell adhesion. This function is linked to its involvement in several signaling pathways, such as the NF-kappa B, Jak-STAT, and Wnt signaling pathways, which are critical for cellular growth and survival (Zhang2021Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
The MT1H gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In prostate and liver cancers, MT1H is downregulated, and its low expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and prognosis. This downregulation is often due to hypermethylation of the MT1H promoter region, which can be reversed to restore its expression (Han2013Metallothionein). In prostate cancer, MT1H acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1), enhancing its activity on histone 3 lysine 9, which is crucial for its tumor suppressor function. Disruption of this interaction negates MT1H's tumor suppressor activity (Han2013Metallothionein).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MT1H is also downregulated, and its low expression correlates with unfavorable survival outcomes. MT1H functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and invasion. Overexpression of MT1H in HCC cell lines has been shown to suppress tumor growth and invasiveness, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2017Metallothionein). The gene's expression is influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as promoter hypermethylation, which is common in cancer and can serve as a biomarker for liver cancer progression (Zhang2021Integrative).

## Interactions
MT1H interacts with euchromatin methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1), a protein involved in histone methylation. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and validated by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments in PC3 cells, demonstrating that MT1H and EHMT1 co-localize in the nucleus (Han2013Metallothionein). The binding occurs directly at the N-terminus of MT1H, specifically within a 19 amino acid stretch at positions 2-20, without the need for bridging proteins (Han2013Metallothionein).

The interaction between MT1H and EHMT1 enhances the methyltransferase activity of EHMT1 on histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), which is crucial for MT1H's tumor suppressor function. This enhancement is evidenced by increased H3K9 methylation when MT1H is expressed, while knockdown of MT1H reduces this methylation, indicating the specificity of MT1H in activating EHMT1's methyltransferase activity. A mutant form of MT1H that cannot bind EHMT1 fails to enhance methyltransferase activity and lacks tumor suppressor activity, underscoring the importance of this interaction for MT1H's function in cancer suppression (Han2013Metallothionein).
