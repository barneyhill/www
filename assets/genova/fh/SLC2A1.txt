# SLC2A1

## Overview
The SLC2A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 1, commonly known as glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1), which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters. GLUT1 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the passive transport of glucose across cell membranes, a process essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and providing energy to cells, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands such as the brain and erythrocytes (Vulturar2022One; Ooi2015Molecular). The protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane alpha-helices, which form a central aqueous channel that allows glucose to diffuse across the plasma membrane (Schaller2019The; Holman2020Structure). Mutations in the SLC2A1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in human health (Verrotti2012Glut1; Brockmann2009The).

## Structure
The SLC2A1 gene encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT1, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters. GLUT1 is composed of 12 transmembrane alpha-helices, organized into two domains, N and C, each containing six helices. These domains are connected by an intracellular helical bundle (ICH), which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the protein in an outward-facing conformation in the absence of a ligand (Schaller2019The; Holman2020Structure).

The tertiary structure of GLUT1 includes a central aqueous channel that facilitates glucose transport across the cell membrane. This channel is formed by the arrangement of the transmembrane helices, allowing for the diffusion of glucose from the bloodstream into cells, particularly across the blood-brain barrier (Mauri2022Molecular). The protein's structure is characterized by a pseudo 2-fold axis of symmetry, with the N-terminal half mirrored by the C-terminal half, which is typical of the SLC2 family (Holman2020Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence the stability and function of GLUT1, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. The protein functions as a monomer, and no quaternary structure is typically applicable (Holman2020Structure).

## Function
The SLC2A1 gene encodes the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1), a crucial protein for glucose transport across cell membranes in healthy human cells. GLUT1 facilitates the passive transport of glucose and other sugars, such as D-galactose and D-glucosamine, across the plasma membrane via facilitated diffusion. This process is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and ensuring an adequate energy supply, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like the brain and erythrocytes (Vulturar2022One; Ooi2015Molecular).

In the brain, GLUT1 is highly expressed in endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where it plays a critical role in mediating glucose transfer, ensuring the brain receives sufficient glucose for energy production and normal function (Zheng2010Glut1SLC2A1; Vulturar2022One). GLUT1 is also involved in the development and maintenance of the BBB, contributing to the integrity of endothelial junctions and cerebral microvasculature (Zheng2010Glut1SLC2A1).

In erythrocytes, GLUT1 is a significant component of the membrane, crucial for maintaining red blood cell integrity and function (Vulturar2022One). The protein is also active in other tissues, including skeletal muscle, the retina, and the placenta, where it supports various metabolic and developmental processes (Vulturar2022One).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC2A1 gene, which encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT1, are primarily associated with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS). This condition is characterized by a range of neurological symptoms due to impaired glucose transport into the brain. Common clinical manifestations include developmental delay, seizures, movement disorders such as ataxia, dystonia, and spasticity, and acquired microcephaly (Verrotti2012Glut1; Brockmann2009The). The syndrome is often caused by heterozygous mutations, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, which can lead to haploinsufficiency (Hashimoto2011SLC2A1; Verrotti2012Glut1).

In addition to GLUT1-DS, mutations in SLC2A1 have been linked to paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) and epilepsy. These conditions are characterized by episodes of involuntary movements and seizures, particularly when the brain's energy demand exceeds supply, such as after exercise (Suls2008Paroxysmal). The clinical features of PED include choreoathetosis and dystonia, primarily affecting the legs, and generalized epileptic seizures with early onset (Suls2008Paroxysmal).

The ketogenic diet has been shown to be an effective treatment for both GLUT1-DS and PED, as it provides an alternative energy source for the brain, reducing the frequency and severity of seizures and movement disorders (Suls2008Paroxysmal; Brockmann2009The).

## Interactions
SLC2A1, also known as GLUT1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in glucose transport and cellular metabolism. One significant interaction is with DERL3, a protein that mediates the degradation of SLC2A1. This interaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is crucial for regulating SLC2A1 protein levels. The downregulation of SLC2A1 by DERL3 is not due to changes in mRNA levels, indicating a post-translational regulatory mechanism (LopezSerra2014A).

In the context of cancer, SLC2A1 is targeted by miR-328, a microRNA that binds to the 3′-untranslated region of SLC2A1 mRNA, leading to decreased expression of the GLUT1 protein. This interaction has been confirmed through luciferase reporter assays and western blot analyses, highlighting miR-328's role in modulating SLC2A1 levels in colon cancer cells (Santasusagna2018miR328).

SLC2A1 also plays a role in the development of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by interacting with proteins involved in endothelial junctions. In zebrafish models, reduced Glut1 function leads to impaired development of cerebral endothelial cells and disrupted junctional complexes, including those involving occludin, claudin 5, and ZO-1 (Zheng2010Glut1SLC2A1).
