# CCDC183

## Overview
CCDC183 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 183, which is primarily expressed in the testis and plays a crucial role in male reproductive biology. The protein is involved in sperm development and maturation, particularly influencing sperm motility and the biogenesis of the flagellum and acrosome in haploid male germ cells. CCDC183 interacts with several proteins, such as FOXP1, TEDC1, and TMF1, which are associated with ciliogenesis, centriole stability, and acrosome formation, respectively. These interactions suggest that CCDC183 contributes to maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating interactions between cellular components. Additionally, alterations in CCDC183 expression have been linked to various diseases, including thyroid cancers, where it is part of co-mutated gene pairs involved in cancer initiation and progression (Zhang2023Three-dimensional; Vandenbrouck2020The).

## Function
The CCDC183 gene is primarily expressed in the testis and plays a significant role in sperm development and maturation. It is upregulated during the transition from secondary spermatocytes to round spermatids and downregulated during late spermiogenesis. Proteomic analysis indicates that CCDC183 is more abundant in high-quality sperm, which is characterized by high forward progressive motility, while poor-quality sperm with lower motility show reduced levels of CCDC183. This suggests that CCDC183 may contribute to sperm motility and the biogenesis of the flagellum and acrosome in haploid male germ cells (Vandenbrouck2020The).

CCDC183 interacts with several proteins, including FOXP1, TEDC1, and TMF1, which are involved in ciliogenesis, centriole stability, and acrosome formation. These interactions imply a role for CCDC183 in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating interactions between cellular components, particularly in the context of male reproductive biology (Vandenbrouck2020The). The gene's expression is predominantly in the testis, as indicated by data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal, supporting its specific function in germ cell development (SiebertKuss2022Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCDC183 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In thyroid cancers, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), CCDC183 is part of co-mutated gene pairs that are spatially close in chromatin conformation. This spatial organization suggests a role in cancer initiation and progression, with specific topologically associating domain (TAD) blocks identified in ATC that include CCDC183 (Zhang2023Three-dimensional).

In reproductive biology, CCDC183 is associated with sperm quality. It is more abundant in high-motility sperm, and its reduced levels are linked to poor-quality sperm with lower motility. This suggests that CCDC183 may play a role in sperm motility and quality, potentially affecting male fertility (Vandenbrouck2020The).

The gene's interactions with other proteins, such as FOXP1, TEDC1, and TMF1, further indicate its involvement in processes like ciliogenesis regulation, centriole stability, and acrosome formation, which are crucial for sperm development and maturation (Vandenbrouck2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC183 in both cancer and reproductive health.

## Interactions
CCDC183 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in sperm motility and development. It is expressed in the testis and is upregulated during the transition from secondary spermatocytes to round spermatids, with a decrease in expression during late spermiogenesis. Proteomic analysis indicates that CCDC183 is more abundant in high-quality sperm, characterized by high forward progressive motility. The study identifies seven protein-protein interactions involving CCDC183, with high interaction scores, suggesting its role in sperm motility. These interactions include proteins such as FOXP1, a transcriptional repressor involved in ciliogenesis, and TEDC1, which is required for centriole stability. TMF1, another interactor, is involved in sperm development and acrosome formation. The excerpt also mentions RABEP1 and RABGEF1, which are involved in endocytic trafficking and may play a role in acrosome biogenesis. The interactions of CCDC183 with these proteins suggest its potential role in the biogenesis of flagellum and acrosome in haploid male germ cells (Vandenbrouck2020The). However, specific details about the physical interactions of CCDC183 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the excerpt (Vandenbrouck2020The).
