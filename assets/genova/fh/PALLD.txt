# PALLD

## Overview
The PALLD gene encodes palladin, a cytoskeletal-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in the organization and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton in human cells. Palladin is characterized by its multiple isoforms, including 90 kDa, 140 kDa, and 200 kDa variants, which are involved in various cellular processes such as morphology, movement, and differentiation. As a scaffold protein, palladin facilitates the formation of actin filament complexes and interacts with several actin-associated proteins, including α-actinin and ezrin, to support cellular structure and signaling pathways. The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, particularly in stress fibers and focal adhesions, where it contributes to cellular integrity and signaling. Palladin's involvement extends to critical physiological processes, including smooth muscle cell differentiation and embryonic development, and its dysregulation is implicated in diseases such as pancreatic cancer and cardiac dysfunction (Mastrototaro2022Ablation; PogueGeile2006Palladin; Rachlin2006Identification).

## Structure
Palladin, encoded by the PALLD gene, is a cytoskeletal-associated protein with multiple isoforms, including 90 kDa, 140 kDa, and 200 kDa variants. These isoforms are transcribed from a single gene on chromosome 8, which contains at least 24 exons. The 140 kDa and 200 kDa isoforms are N-terminal extensions of the 90 kDa protein. The 140 kDa isoform includes a proline-rich region and additional binding sites for the Ena/Mena/VASP protein family, while the 200 kDa isoform features a fifth IgC2 domain and a unique sequence not classified into any known domain (Rachlin2006Identification).

Palladin contains immunoglobulin-like domains, specifically IgC2 domains, which suggest a complex tertiary structure. The 140 kDa isoform has four IgC2 domains, and the 200 kDa isoform includes an additional IgC2 domain (Rachlin2006Identification). The Ig3 domain of palladin is crucial for actin binding and stimulates actin polymerization by eliminating the lag phase of nucleation and reducing depolymerization (Gurung2016Actin).

Palladin is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions with other proteins. The protein's interaction with actin and other proteins like Lasp-1 indicates a potential quaternary structure involving these interactions (Rachlin2006Identification).

## Function
The PALLD gene encodes the palladin protein, which plays a critical role in the organization and maintenance of the cytoskeleton in human cells. Palladin functions as a scaffold for actin-associated proteins, facilitating the formation of actin filament complexes essential for cell morphology, movement, and differentiation (PogueGeile2006Palladin). It interacts with proteins such as α-actinin and ezrin, contributing to actin remodeling and cellular structure by localizing to actin-rich structures like stress fibers and focal adhesions (Otey2005The; Rachlin2006Identification).

Palladin is involved in maintaining cellular architecture and signaling pathways, such as the Rho pathway and VASP-mediated control of the actomyosin system, which are crucial for cellular polarity and stationary positioning (Otey2005The; PogueGeile2006Palladin). In smooth muscle cells, palladin is essential for differentiation, interacting with myocardin-related transcription factors to regulate the transcription of smooth muscle cell marker genes (Jin2010The). The protein's role in cytoskeletal organization is further highlighted by its involvement in embryonic development, where its absence leads to severe developmental defects (Rachlin2006Identification). Palladin's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, particularly in stress fibers and focal adhesions, where it contributes to cellular structural integrity and signaling pathways (Rachlin2006Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PALLD gene, which encodes the palladin protein, have been implicated in several diseases, most notably pancreatic cancer. A specific mutation, P239S, in the PALLD gene is associated with a rare form of autosomal dominant familial pancreatic cancer. This mutation leads to changes in the cytoskeletal structure and increased cell motility, contributing to the invasive nature of pancreatic tumors (PogueGeile2006Palladin). Palladin is overexpressed in the stromal cells of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, where it plays a role in activating fibroblasts to promote tumor invasion (Brentnall2012Arousal; Salaria2007Palladin). This overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes and is considered a potential prognostic marker (Brentnall2012Arousal).

In addition to its role in cancer, PALLD is crucial for cardiac function. Ablation of PALLD in adult mouse hearts leads to dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by cardiac dilation, systolic dysfunction, and fibrosis. This suggests that PALLD is essential for maintaining cardiac structure and function, and its altered expression may contribute to cardiac diseases (Mastrototaro2022Ablation).

## Interactions
Palladin, encoded by the PALLD gene, is a cytoskeletal protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in actin organization and cellular structure. Palladin interacts with α-actinin, a filament cross-linking protein, through a specific segment of palladin (amino acids 222-280) and the carboxy-terminal EF-hand repeats 3-4 of α-actinin. This interaction is important for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in both muscle and non-muscle cells (RONTY2004Molecular).

Palladin also binds to Eps8, a receptor tyrosine kinase substrate, enhancing the formation of dorsal ruffles and podosomes. This interaction involves the N-terminal proline-rich domain of palladin and is significant for actin dynamics and cell motility (Goicoechea2006Palladin).

Additionally, palladin interacts with VASP, a member of the Ena/VASP family, through its proline-rich motifs, FPPPP and FPLPP. This interaction is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes in stress fibers and focal adhesions (Boukhelifa2004Palladin).

Palladin's interaction with the SH3 domains of SPIN90 and Src is crucial for Src-induced cytoskeletal remodeling, highlighting its role in actin reorganization (Rönty2007Palladin).
