# NOXO1

## Overview
NOXO1 (NADPH oxidase organizer 1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the assembly and activation of the NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) complex, which is crucial for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. The NOXO1 protein is characterized by its role as an organizer within the NOX1 complex, facilitating interactions with other components such as NOXA1, Rac1, NOX1, and p22phox. This protein is distinguished by its structural domains, including a PX domain and SH3 domains, which enable it to bind membrane phosphoinositides and interact with other proteins, respectively. Unlike its homolog p47phox, NOXO1 lacks an autoinhibitory region, allowing for more efficient interaction with p22phox. NOXO1 is primarily expressed in the colon epithelium and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, with NOXO1β and NOXO1γ being the most prevalent. The protein's involvement in ROS generation links it to various physiological processes and diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Dang2023p47phox; Debbabi2013NOXO1; Joo2016NADPH).

## Structure
NOXO1 (NADPH oxidase organizer 1) is a protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 16 (16p13.3) and consists of 370 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 41 kDa (Dang2023p47phox). The protein structure includes several key domains: a PX domain (amino acids 2-131) that binds membrane phosphoinositides, two SH3 domains (amino acids 157-218 and 228-291) that interact with p22phox, and a proline-rich region (PRR) (amino acids 320-332) that potentially interacts with NOXA1 (Dang2023p47phox; Yamamoto2007Interaction). Unlike its homolog p47phox, NOXO1 lacks an autoinhibitory region (AIR), which allows it to interact more readily with p22phox (Yamamoto2007Interaction).

NOXO1 exists in four splice variant isoforms: α, β, δ, and γ. The β and γ isoforms are more abundant, with NOXO1β primarily located in the plasma membrane and NOXO1γ found in both the plasma membrane and nucleus (Dang2023p47phox). Phosphorylation of NOXO1, particularly at serine 154, is crucial for its interaction with NOXA1 and p22phox, enhancing the assembly and activation of the NOX1 complex (Debbabi2013NOXO1).

## Function
NOXO1 (NADPH oxidase organizer 1) is a regulatory subunit of the NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) complex, which is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. It acts as an organizer protein, facilitating the assembly and activation of the NOX1 complex, which includes NOXO1, NOXA1, Rac1, NOX1, and p22phox. This complex is responsible for generating superoxide anions, a type of ROS, which play a crucial role in innate immunity and other physiological functions (Dang2023p47phox).

NOXO1 is homologous to p47phox, a subunit of the NOX2 complex, and is primarily expressed in the colon epithelium. It plays a crucial role in the activation of NOX1 by forming a complex with NOXA1 and NOX1, resulting in low constitutive activity of the NOX1 complex. The absence of any of these proteins can prevent the activity of the NOX1 complex (Dang2023p47phox).

NOXO1 has a PX domain that binds to membrane phosphoinositides, which are present in non-activated cells, suggesting a role in maintaining basal NOX1 activity. There are four structural variants of NOXO1 due to alternative splicing, with NOXO1β and NOXO1γ being the most abundant and functionally significant in supporting NOX1 activity (Dang2023p47phox).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NOXO1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In colorectal cancer, NOXO1 is overexpressed, leading to increased ROS production and contributing to tumor formation. This overexpression is associated with the disruption of the NoxO1-Grb2-Cbl complex and the formation of the NoxA1/NoxO1/p22 phox/Nox1 complex, which enhances cell proliferation and cancer progression (Benssouina2023Overexpression; Joo2016NADPH).

In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), NOXO1 is upregulated in response to smoke exposure, suggesting its involvement in the development of emphysema. Variants of the NOXO1 gene have been identified in some COPD patients, who exhibit better lung function, indicating that NOXO1 dysfunction may attenuate smoke-induced lung damage (Seimetz2020NADPH).

NOXO1 also plays a role in cardiovascular diseases, particularly in atherosclerosis. In female mice, the deletion of NOXO1 leads to reduced atherosclerosis and a decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine signature, suggesting that NOXO1 contributes to vascular dysfunction through its role in ROS production and inflammation (Buchmann2020Deletion). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NOXO1 in various diseases where oxidative stress is a key factor.

## Interactions
NOXO1 (NADPH oxidase organizer 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate the assembly and activation of the NADPH oxidase complex. It interacts with NOXA1 and p22 PHOX, which are essential components for the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1). Phosphorylation of NOXO1 at serine 154 enhances its binding to NOXA1 and p22 PHOX, which is crucial for the optimal assembly and activation of NOX1 (Debbabi2013NOXO1).

In colon cancer cells, NOXO1 interacts with growth receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) through its proline-rich region (PRR) and the SH3 domain of Grb2. This interaction recruits the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) E3 ligase, leading to the proteasomal degradation of NOXO1, thereby regulating NOX1 activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (Joo2016NADPH).

NOXO1 also forms a complex with NOXA1 and p22 PHOX, which is enhanced in colorectal cancer tissues, suggesting a role in cancer development. The stability of NOXO1 is increased in cancer tissues, contributing to ROS generation and signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation (Joo2016NADPH). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of NOXO1 in ROS production and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer.
