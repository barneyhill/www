# NDFIP2

## Overview
NDFIP2, or Nedd4 family interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases, particularly those of the NEDD4 family. The protein, also known as N4WBP5A, is characterized by its two PY motifs and three putative transmembrane domains, which facilitate its interaction with the WW domains of NEDD4 family proteins and its association with membrane structures (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). NDFIP2 plays a critical role in intracellular protein trafficking and ubiquitination processes, influencing the localization and activity of various substrates, including proteins involved in cellular signaling and antiviral defense (Marziali2023A; Mund2009Control). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several physiological and pathological conditions, such as iron metabolism, hypertension, and potentially autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases (Trimpert2017NDFIP; Foot2016Ndfip2).

## Structure
NDFIP2, also known as N4WBP5A, is a protein that interacts with the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. The protein contains two PY motifs in its amino terminal region, which are crucial for its interaction with the WW domains of Nedd4 family proteins (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). These interactions are primarily mediated by PY motif 1 and WW domain 3 of Nedd4, with the interaction significantly reduced when PY motif 1 is mutated (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). NDFIP2 also contains three putative transmembrane domains in its carboxyl terminal half, suggesting its association with membrane structures (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A).

The protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus, multivesicular bodies, and vesicles associated with the Golgi complex, indicating a role in intracellular protein trafficking (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). NDFIP2 is ubiquitinated by Nedd4 family proteins, a process enhanced by its interaction with these proteins, although its ubiquitination does not significantly affect its turnover (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). The protein is long-lived, with a half-life of approximately 6 hours (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). The study does not provide specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of NDFIP2.

## Function
NDFIP2 (Nedd4 family interacting protein 2) is a crucial regulator of E3 ubiquitin ligases, particularly those of the NEDD4 family. It functions by binding to these ligases, activating their catalytic activity by releasing them from an autoinhibitory state. This activation allows the ligases to ubiquitinate various substrates, including proteins like JunB and endophilin, thereby promoting ubiquitination in vivo (Mund2009Control). NDFIP2 is also involved in recruiting NEDD4 family ligases to cellular membranes, such as endosomes, through its PY motifs, which are essential for this interaction. This recruitment is vital for the localization and activation of these ligases, enhancing their autoubiquitination and the ubiquitination of other substrates (Mund2009Control).

In addition to its role in ubiquitination, NDFIP2 is implicated in protein trafficking. It localizes to multivesicular bodies and the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in the endocytic pathway and receptor sorting. Overexpression of NDFIP2 can inhibit the accumulation of epidermal growth factor in late-stage endosomes, indicating its involvement in the degradative pathway of receptors like EGFR (ShearwinWhyatt2004N4WBP5A). NDFIP2 also regulates the levels of IFITM3, a protein involved in antiviral defense, by modulating its interaction with NEDD4, thereby influencing cellular susceptibility to viral infections (Marziali2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NDFIP2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. NDFIP2 is involved in the regulation of iron metabolism, particularly in the liver, where it influences the expression of the iron transporter DMT1. Alterations in NDFIP2 expression can lead to changes in iron homeostasis, potentially impacting conditions such as iron-deficiency anemia. Female mice lacking NDFIP2 exhibit increased hepatic DMT1 levels and altered iron regulation, suggesting a sex-specific role in iron metabolism (Foot2016Ndfip2).

NDFIP2 also interacts with NEDD4 family proteins, playing a role in protein trafficking and ubiquitination processes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of proteins such as AQP2, a water channel protein in the kidney. Although NDFIP2 knockdown did not significantly affect AQP2 stability in certain cell types, its interaction with NEDD4/NEDD4L suggests a potential role in kidney function and related disorders (Trimpert2017NDFIP).

A single nucleotide polymorphism in NDFIP2 has been associated with hypertension, indicating its potential clinical significance in cardiovascular conditions (Trimpert2017NDFIP). The gene's involvement in protein degradation pathways and cellular signaling highlights its importance in disease pathogenesis, including autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.

## Interactions
NDFIP2 (Nedd4 family interacting protein 2) is known for its interactions with the Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4 and ITCH. These interactions are facilitated by the PY motifs of NDFIP2, which bind to the WW domains of the ligases, activating their catalytic activity and promoting ubiquitination of various substrates (Mund2009Control). NDFIP2 acts as a recruiter and activator of these ligases, enhancing their autoubiquitination and the ubiquitination of other proteins such as endophilin and Jun proteins (Mund2009Control).

NDFIP2 also forms a tripartite complex with NEDD4 and IFITM3, acting as a clustering partner and membrane anchor. This complex influences the localization and stability of IFITM3, with NDFIP2 competing with IFITM3 for NEDD4 binding, thereby regulating IFITM3 levels and potentially affecting viral susceptibility (Marziali2023A).

In the context of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, NDFIP2 interacts with proteins such as Src and Lyn kinases. It is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, which enhances its role as a scaffold for recruiting these kinases and promoting their ubiquitination (Mund2010Regulation). These interactions underscore NDFIP2's significant role in cellular signaling pathways.
