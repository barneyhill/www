# FAM110D

## Overview
FAM110D is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 110, member D. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. FAM110D has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and may play a role in cancer biology, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The protein encoded by FAM110D is part of a six-gene signature that has been associated with improved prognosis in HCC patients, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker for disease outcome (Cai2021Identification). Further studies are required to explore the detailed mechanisms of FAM110D's action and its broader implications in human health and disease (Cai2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
FAM110D, also known as GRRP1, has been identified as a protective gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its expression is associated with a better prognosis in HCC patients. A study using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified FAM110D as part of a six-gene signature that predicts HCC prognosis. This signature demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the commonly used clinical biomarker AFP, with lower risk scores correlating with better patient outcomes (Cai2021Identification). FAM110D was found to be downregulated in HCC, acting as a protective factor, while other genes in the signature were upregulated and associated with adverse outcomes (Cai2021Identification).

The study suggests that changes in the expression levels of FAM110D are linked to HCC prognosis, with its downregulation being associated with better outcomes. This indicates that FAM110D may play a role in the progression of HCC and could potentially serve as a biomarker for predicting patient survival (Cai2021Identification). Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which FAM110D influences cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
