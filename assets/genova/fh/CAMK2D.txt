# CAMK2D

## Overview
The CAMK2D gene encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ), a serine-threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling pathways. This protein is a member of the CaMKII family, which is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, cardiac function, and cellular response to stress. CaMKIIδ is characterized by its ability to form oligomeric structures, typically dodecamers, which are essential for its function in signal transduction. The protein's activity is regulated by calcium/calmodulin binding and subsequent autophosphorylation, which allows it to function as a molecular switch in both neuronal and cardiac cells. The diverse roles of CaMKIIδ in different tissues underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cardiac dysfunctions and neurodevelopmental disorders (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D; Sloutsky2020Heterogeneity).

## Structure
The CAMK2D gene encodes the CaMKIIδ protein, which is part of the CaMKII family involved in calcium signaling. The protein structure includes an N-terminal catalytic domain, an autoregulatory domain, a C-terminal hub domain for oligomerization, and a linker region (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D). The catalytic domain is responsible for the enzyme's activity, while the hub domain facilitates oligomerization into dodecameric assemblies (Sloutsky2020Heterogeneity). The regulatory segment contains autophosphorylation sites, including Thr287, which is crucial for autonomous activation (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D). 

CaMKIIδ proteins can form oligomers typically consisting of 12 monomers, and activation occurs when Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, leading to the binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin complex to the autoregulatory segment (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D). The protein's structure is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as autophosphorylation of Thr287, which blocks the re-binding of the inhibitory αI helix (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D). The variable linker region is subject to extensive alternative splicing, resulting in a diverse array of splice variants (Sloutsky2020Heterogeneity). These structural features contribute to the functional diversity of the CaMKIIδ protein.

## Function
The CAMK2D gene encodes the CaMKIIδ protein, a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling within neuronal and cardiac cells. In the heart, CaMKIIδ is actively involved in the phosphorylation of proteins that regulate cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, influencing both mechanical and electrical properties of cardiac muscle cells. This activity is essential for maintaining normal heart function and is modulated by calcium/calmodulin binding, which activates the kinase by exposing a key residue, Thr287, to autophosphorylation. This modification allows the enzyme to remain active even after calcium levels decrease, functioning as a molecular switch (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D).

In the brain, CaMKIIδ is involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation, processes critical for learning and memory. The protein's ability to remain active after initial activation is crucial for sustaining these processes (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D). CaMKIIδ is also expressed in articular cartilage, where it contributes to cartilage homeostasis by regulating the expression of cartilage matrix proteins such as Sox9 and Col2a1, which are important for maintaining the phenotype of mature chondrocytes (Zhang2017miR146a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAMK2D gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly affecting the heart and brain. In the heart, overexpression of CAMK2D is associated with cardiac dysfunctions such as hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, decreased contractility, cardiac fibrosis, and arrhythmias. Elevated levels of autophosphorylated CaMKIIδ, the protein encoded by CAMK2D, have been observed in heart failure models, suggesting a link to cardiac dysfunction (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D). Inhibition of CaMKIIδ has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to improve myocardial performance and reduce arrhythmias (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, a de novo missense variant in CAMK2D (p.Arg275His) has been associated with syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder, including dilated cardiomyopathy and developmental delay. This variant may destabilize the autoinhibited state of the enzyme, potentially increasing its sensitivity to Ca2+/calmodulin, which could affect cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (Tolmacheva2023CAMK2D).

In cancer, CAMK2D overexpression has been linked to cisplatin resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting a role in drug resistance and a potential marker for recurrence risk (Xu2018Overexpression).

## Interactions
CAMK2D, a subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. CAMK2D interacts with RNF8, specifically binding to the FHA domain of RNF8. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation state of CAMK2D, particularly at threonine 287 (p-Thr287). The phosphorylated form of CAMK2D binds more effectively to RNF8, enhancing CAMK2D's kinase activity and facilitating the phosphorylation of RNF8 at serine 157 (Chuah2023CAMK2D).

CAMK2D also acts as a molecular scaffold for the RNF8-MAD2 complex, which is essential for mitotic checkpoint regulation in glioma stem cells. This scaffolding role is critical for the formation and stability of the complex throughout the cell cycle, indicating a stable interaction between CAMK2D, RNF8, and MAD2 (Chuah2023CAMK2D).

In addition to its interactions with RNF8 and MAD2, CAMK2D is involved in the necroptosis pathway in smooth muscle cells, where it is activated downstream of RIPK3. However, direct interactions between CAMK2D and RIPK3 have not been detected, suggesting an indirect role in this pathway (Zhou2021MLKL).
