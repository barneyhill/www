# SCYGR1

## Overview
The SCYGR1 gene encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 1, which is characterized by its unique sequence of cysteine and glycine repeats. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. SCYGR1 is categorized as a structural protein due to its repetitive amino acid motifs, which suggest a role in maintaining cellular architecture or facilitating protein-protein interactions. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest in recent studies due to their potential involvement in specific signaling pathways and disease mechanisms, although further research is needed to clarify these roles (Qiu2020aarFDC).
