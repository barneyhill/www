# MRGPRX4

## Overview
MRGPRX4 is a gene that encodes the MAS related GPR family member X4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in sensory perception, particularly in the mediation of itch sensations. This receptor is predominantly expressed in human dorsal root ganglion neurons and is activated by bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid, through a Gq-dependent signaling pathway. The activation of MRGPRX4 leads to increased intracellular calcium levels, which are crucial for its role in sensory signaling (Yu2019MRGPRX4; Yu2019MRGPRX4a). The receptor's function extends beyond itch perception, as it is also implicated in clinical conditions like cholestatic itch and has been associated with menthol cigarette smoking preferences due to genetic variations (Kozlitina2019An; Yu2019MRGPRX4a). MRGPRX4's interactions with various ligands, including pharmacological agents and bile acids, underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for managing itch-related disorders (Meixiong2019MRGPRX4).

## Function
MRGPRX4 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in a subset of human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) neurons, which are involved in sensory perception, particularly itch sensation. This receptor is activated by bile acids, with deoxycholic acid (DCA) being a potent agonist, and it operates through a Gq-dependent signaling pathway involving phospholipase C, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels (Yu2019MRGPRX4; Yu2019MRGPRX4a). MRGPRX4 is co-expressed with other sensory markers such as the histamine receptor HRH1 and TRPV1, indicating its role in itch and pain signaling (Yu2019MRGPRX4).

In healthy human cells, MRGPRX4 functions primarily as an itch receptor, mediating responses to pharmacological agents like nateglinide, an MRGPRX4 agonist, which induces a robust itch sensation (Yu2019MRGPRX4a). The receptor's activation by bile acids suggests its involvement in normal sensory neuron function, although its precise role in healthy cells beyond itch sensation is not fully detailed (Meixiong2019MRGPRX4). MRGPRX4's expression in sensory neurons and its ability to respond to environmental stimuli highlight its significance in modulating sensory perception and organismal responses.

## Clinical Significance
The MRGPRX4 gene is implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to its role as a receptor for bile acids. Alterations in MRGPRX4 expression or function are associated with cholestatic itch, a chronic itch condition often linked to liver diseases. This condition arises due to the activation of MRGPRX4 by elevated bile acids in cholestatic patients, leading to itch sensations that are independent of histamine signaling, making traditional antihistamines ineffective (Yu2019MRGPRX4; Yu2019MRGPRX4a). The gene's role in mediating itch is further supported by its expression in human dorsal root ganglion neurons, where it co-localizes with other itch-related receptors (Yu2019MRGPRX4a).

In addition to its role in itch, genetic variations in MRGPRX4 have been linked to menthol cigarette smoking preferences, particularly among individuals of African ancestry. A specific haplotype in the MRGPRX4 gene, consisting of the variants rs7102322[G] and rs61733596[G], is associated with an increased likelihood of menthol cigarette use. This haplotype results in a receptor with altered agonism, particularly in response to menthol, which may influence smoking behaviors and contribute to health disparities (Kozlitina2019An).

## Interactions
MRGPRX4, a G protein-coupled receptor, is primarily activated by bile acids, which are known to induce itch sensations in cholestatic conditions. This receptor is expressed in human dorsal root ganglion neurons, where it plays a significant role in mediating itch through its interaction with bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) (Yu2019MRGPRX4; Meixiong2019MRGPRX4). The activation of MRGPRX4 by these bile acids involves a Gq-dependent signaling pathway, which includes phospholipase C, as evidenced by the reduction of calcium signals upon treatment with a phospholipase C inhibitor (Yu2019MRGPRX4).

MRGPRX4 also interacts with bilirubin, which acts as a partial agonist. Although bilirubin is less potent than bile acids, it can enhance the activation of MRGPRX4 by bile acids, suggesting an allosteric modulation (Yu2019MRGPRX4). The receptor's interaction with nateglinide, a drug for type 2 diabetes, further implicates MRGPRX4 in itch pathways, as nateglinide acts as an agonist and causes itch as a side effect (Meixiong2019MRGPRX4). These interactions highlight MRGPRX4's role in sensory neuron signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target for cholestatic itch.
