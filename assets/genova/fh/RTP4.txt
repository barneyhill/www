# RTP4

## Overview
RTP4, or receptor transporter protein 4, is a gene that encodes a chaperone protein involved in the transport and functional expression of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface. The RTP4 protein plays a critical role in facilitating the proper folding and translocation of GPCRs, such as opioid receptors, from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, thereby influencing cellular signaling pathways (He2020RTP4; Norheim2021Genetic). Additionally, RTP4 is categorized as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) and is involved in modulating immune responses by negatively regulating the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway. This regulation is achieved through interactions with the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex, affecting the expression and phosphorylation of key signaling components (He2020RTP4). RTP4's involvement in immune modulation extends to its role in antiviral defense, where it interacts with viral replication machinery to restrict flavivirus replication (Boys2020RTP4). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with conditions such as primary Sjögren's syndrome, severe depression during IFN-α treatment, and its potential as a prognostic marker in cutaneous melanoma (Li2021RTP4; Norheim2021Genetic).

## Function
RTP4 (receptor transporter protein 4) is involved in the transport and functional expression of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface. It acts as a chaperone protein, facilitating the proper folding and translocation of GPCRs, such as opioid receptors, from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. This process is crucial for the correct localization and function of these receptors, impacting cellular signaling pathways (He2020RTP4; Norheim2021Genetic).

RTP4 is also an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that modulates immune responses. It negatively regulates the type I interferon (IFN-I) response by interacting with the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex. RTP4 inhibits the expression and phosphorylation of TBK1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which are key components of the IFN-I signaling pathway. This regulation affects the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the cell's ability to respond to viral infections (He2020RTP4).

In addition to its role in immune modulation, RTP4 is associated with the regulation of opioid and taste receptors, influencing sensory perception and potentially affecting fatigue and mental depression in certain conditions (Norheim2021Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RTP4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Scandinavian patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), genetic variants at the RTP4/MASP1 locus are associated with fatigue. The major allele of the top variant at this locus correlates with elevated fatigue levels, suggesting a genetic influence on fatigue through immune response regulation (Norheim2021Genetic). RTP4 is also involved in severe depression and suicidal behavior during IFN-α treatment, as it is an interferon-induced gene (Norheim2021Genetic).

In the context of cutaneous melanoma, RTP4 has been identified as a novel prognostic gene. It is associated with immune cell infiltration in melanoma metastases and correlates with immune checkpoint genes, indicating its potential role in immune regulation and as a target for immune checkpoint inhibitors (Li2021RTP4).

RTP4 also plays a role in modulating immune responses to malaria and viral infections. It acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon responses, which are crucial for controlling malaria parasite infections. RTP4 deficiency in mice leads to higher interferon levels and reduced neurological symptoms in malaria, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases with neuropathology (He2020RTP4).

## Interactions
RTP4 (Receptor Transporter Protein 4) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in antiviral defense and immune regulation. RTP4 interacts with the viral replication machinery, including the non-structural proteins NS5 and NS3, as well as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), to restrict the replication of flaviviruses by targeting genome amplification (Boys2020RTP4). It also binds to viral RNA, with its N-terminal 3CXXC zinc finger domain being crucial for this interaction, which is essential for its antiviral activity (Boys2020RTP4).

In the context of immune response regulation, RTP4 interacts with components of the interferon type I (IFN-I) signaling pathway. It binds to the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex, inhibiting the expression and phosphorylation of TBK1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby acting as a negative regulator of the IFN-I response (He2020RTP4). RTP4 also interacts with STING and TRAFs, but not with MDA5 or RIG-I, further modulating the IFN-I response by affecting protein interactions and phosphorylation events (He2020RTP4). These interactions highlight RTP4's role in both antiviral defense and immune regulation.
