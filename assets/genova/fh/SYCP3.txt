# SYCP3

## Overview
SYCP3 is a gene that encodes the synaptonemal complex protein 3, a structural protein integral to the formation and function of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the SC, specifically contributing to the lateral elements that facilitate the synapsis of homologous chromosomes. The SYCP3 protein forms a tetrameric assembly that interacts with DNA, playing a crucial role in organizing meiotic chromosomes and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Its function is vital for genetic recombination and fertility, as mutations in the SYCP3 gene can lead to reproductive issues such as infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss (Syrjänen2014A; Llano2023Synaptonemal). Additionally, aberrant expression of SYCP3 has been implicated in certain cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Llano2023Synaptonemal).

## Structure
The human SYCP3 protein is a key component of the synaptonemal complex, essential for meiotic chromosome organization. It forms a tetrameric structure characterized by a helical core, which is crucial for its function. The core region, consisting of amino acids 66-230, is highly stable and forms a tetrameric assembly with a molecular weight of approximately 78.6 kDa, closely matching its theoretical size of 79.5 kDa (Syrjänen2014A). The tetramer is composed of helical chains arranged in an alternating antiparallel fashion, with each end containing two N-termini and two C-termini (Syrjänen2014A).

The SYCP3 protein can bind DNA through its N-terminal regions, which extend from the tetrameric core, allowing it to act as a physical strut that holds distant regions of DNA together (Syrjänen2014A). The tetrameric assembly includes a combination of four-helix bundles and coiled-coil motifs, with a left-handed 90° rotation along its length (Syrjänen2014A). The structure is asymmetrical, resulting in unique conformations for each of the four SYCP3 chains (Syrjänen2014A).

SYCP3 can self-assemble into filamentous structures, forming fibers with a periodicity of 23 nm, resembling the native synaptonemal complex lateral element (Syrjänen2014A). The self-assembly is mediated by specific amino acid motifs in the N-and C-terminal tails of its tetrameric core structure (Syrjänen2014A). The protein's ability to form these higher-order structures is crucial for its role in meiotic chromosome organization.

## Function
SYCP3 is a critical component of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure essential for meiosis in germ cells. It plays a significant role in the formation of the lateral elements (LE) of the SC, which are crucial for the proper alignment and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. SYCP3, along with SYCP1, helps create a zipper-like structure between homologous chromosomes, facilitating their synapsis and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis (Llano2023Synaptonemal). 

In healthy human cells, SYCP3 is involved in organizing meiotic chromosomes during prophase I, contributing to the structural framework necessary for double-strand break repair and crossover formation, which are vital for genetic recombination and diversity (Llano2023Synaptonemal). SYCP3 stabilizes chromatin loops and colocalizes with SYCP2 along the chromosome axes, with their recruitment being interdependent and requiring prior assembly of cohesins (Llano2023Synaptonemal).

The proper function of SYCP3 is essential for fertility, as mutations in the SYCP3 gene can lead to infertility phenotypes such as primary ovarian insufficiency and nonobstructive azoospermia (Llano2023Synaptonemal). In the absence of SYCP3, meiotic defects such as synaptic and double-strand break repair issues, increased apoptosis, and meiotic arrest can occur, highlighting its crucial role in meiosis (Llano2023Synaptonemal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYCP3 gene are associated with various reproductive issues, primarily infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. In humans, mutations such as c.548T>C, c.553-16_19del, and c.657T>C have been linked to recurrent miscarriages and pregnancy loss, as they disrupt normal splicing and lead to truncated proteins, affecting the synaptonemal complex's function during meiosis (Zhang2022Alterations). In males, mutations like the 643delA deletion result in azoospermia due to premature stop codons that truncate the C-terminal coiled-coil region of SYCP3, impairing its ability to form fibers necessary for chromosome pairing (Zhang2022Alterations).

SYCP3 mutations can also have dominant-negative effects, interfering with the proper formation of the synaptonemal complex and leading to meiotic arrest and infertility (Llano2023Synaptonemal). In mice, SYCP3 deficiency results in male sterility and reduced fertility in females due to aneuploidy and embryonic lethality (Bollschweiler2019Molecular).

Altered expression of SYCP3 is implicated in certain cancers, where its ectopic expression can lead to increased aneuploidy and genomic instability by impairing DNA repair mechanisms (Syrjänen2014A; Llano2023Synaptonemal). This aberrant expression is linked to oncogenic processes, contributing to tumorigenesis (Llano2023Synaptonemal).

## Interactions
SYCP3 is a key component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and plays a crucial role in meiotic chromosome organization through its interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. SYCP3 forms a tetrameric assembly that binds to DNA, facilitating the compaction and organization of meiotic chromosomes. This binding is mediated by the N-terminal regions of SYCP3, which contain conserved basic patches essential for DNA interaction (Syrjänen2014A; Syrjänen2017Singlemolecule). 

SYCP3 also interacts with other proteins within the SC. It forms a hetero-tetramer with SYCP2, which is critical for its recruitment to the chromosome axis and for the assembly of the lateral elements of the SC (Bollschweiler2019Molecular). These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the SC and facilitating homologous recombination during meiosis (Syrjänen2014A).

The protein can self-assemble into filamentous fibers, a process that is dependent on its N- and C-terminal sequences. These fibers can interact with double-stranded DNA, allowing SYCP3 to simultaneously engage with distinct DNA segments, which is crucial for its structural role in determining the architecture of the lateral element (Bollschweiler2019Molecular).
