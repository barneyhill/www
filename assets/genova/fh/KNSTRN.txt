# KNSTRN

## Overview
The KNSTRN gene encodes the Small Kinetochore-Associated Protein (SKAP), a crucial component in the regulation of chromosome segregation during cell division. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that plays a significant role in mitosis by forming a complex with astrin, a mitotic spindle-associated protein, to ensure proper chromosome alignment and spindle architecture. The SKAP protein, characterized by its coiled-coil domains, is involved in stabilizing microtubule-kinetochore attachments and is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. Beyond its role in mitosis, KNSTRN is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell migration, and has been associated with oncogenic activities in several cancers, such as breast, bladder, and lung cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dunsch2011The; Cindric2016Characterization; Xiong2021KNSTRN).

## Structure
The KNSTRN gene encodes the Small Kinetochore-Associated Protein (SKAP), which is involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein has several isoforms, with SKAP1 and SKAP16 being the most studied. SKAP1 is testis-specific and contains a unique N-terminal extension of 78 amino acids, which is absent in SKAP16. This N-terminal region is crucial for SKAP1's specific functions in spermatids and mature sperm, including localization to the sperm flagellum and interaction with microtubular structures (Cindric2016Characterization). SKAP16, on the other hand, is ubiquitously expressed and forms homomeric complexes via its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is important for its role in mitosis (Cindric2016Characterization).

The protein structure includes coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins such as Pontin, Reptin, and Astrin, involved in microtubule dynamics and sperm motility (Cindric2016Characterization). The SKAP:Astrin complex is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation, with SKAP containing a microtubule-binding domain distinct from the SXIP motif, which is involved in end-binding protein interactions (Friese2016Molecular). The precise molecular structure of KNSTRN, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The KNSTRN gene encodes the Small Kinetochore-Associated Protein (SKAP), which plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly during cell division. SKAP is essential for the formation and function of the mitotic spindle and the outer kinetochore, structures that are vital for accurate chromosome segregation. It ensures proper chromosome alignment and stable spindle-kinetochore attachment, which are critical for anaphase progression and maintaining spindle pole architecture (Cindric2016Characterization). 

SKAP forms a heterodimer with Astrin, and this complex localizes to spindle microtubules and mature microtubule-kinetochore attachments during mitosis. The SKAP:Astrin complex is involved in suppressing kinetochore-microtubule turnover and tracks the growing plus ends of microtubules, signaling the establishment of mature, end-on attachments (Friese2016Molecular). SKAP's interaction with the KMN protein network and other proteins like CENP-E and Kif18a is crucial for its recruitment to kinetochores (Friese2016Molecular).

In addition to its role in mitosis, SKAP is implicated in apoptosis and directional cell migration. Mutations in the KNSTRN gene have been associated with certain cancers, suggesting its potential role as an oncogene (Cindric2016Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KNSTRN gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In breast cancer, KNSTRN acts as a positive regulator of cell cycle progression and promotes cell proliferation. Overexpression of KNSTRN enhances proliferation, while its silencing suppresses it. This gene influences the cell cycle by regulating the expression of various cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, and its high expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Zhang2024KNSTRN).

In bladder cancer, KNSTRN is involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Its overexpression promotes AKT pathway activation, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. KNSTRN knockdown has been shown to reduce metastasis and increase sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine by modulating the AKT/FOXO1 pathway (Xiong2021KNSTRN).

In lung adenocarcinoma, high KNSTRN expression is linked to poor overall survival and progression-free survival. It is associated with advanced clinicopathological features and is considered a significant prognostic marker (Deng2020Increased).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated KNSTRN expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune escape and cancer progression (Jin2023NamiRNAmediated).

## Interactions
KNSTRN, also known as kinastrin, is a protein that plays a significant role in mitosis by interacting with various proteins to ensure proper chromosome alignment and spindle architecture. It forms a complex with astrin, a mitotic spindle-associated protein, which is crucial for its localization to microtubule plus ends. This interaction is essential for the stability of microtubule-kinetochore attachments and proper chromosome alignment during cell division (Dunsch2011The).

The astrin-kinastrin complex also includes minor partners such as dynein light chain (DYNLL1), Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgo2), which are suggested to regulate the complex's function (Dunsch2011The). Kinastrin interacts with the PH domain of AKT, facilitating AKT phosphorylation and activation, which is crucial for tumorigenesis in bladder cancer (Xiong2021KNSTRN).

In addition to its role in mitosis, KNSTRN is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, where it competes with PTEN for binding to AKT, thereby promoting AKT activation and contributing to cancer progression and drug resistance (Xiong2021KNSTRN). These interactions highlight KNSTRN's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
