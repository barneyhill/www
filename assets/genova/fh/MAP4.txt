# MAP4

## Overview
MAP4 (microtubule-associated protein 4) is a gene that encodes a cytoskeletal protein involved in the stabilization and regulation of microtubules, which are critical components of the cellular cytoskeleton. The MAP4 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is expressed in various tissues, where it plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as mitosis, intracellular transport, and cell shape determination. The protein's structure includes distinct domains that facilitate its binding to microtubules, thereby influencing their dynamics and organization (Chapin1994Cellular; Aizawa1991Functional). MAP4 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its function and interactions with other proteins, impacting processes like cardiac remodeling and mitochondrial function (Li2018Microtubule; Li2019Cardiac). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are regulated through alternative splicing and phosphorylation, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular physiology and its potential implications in disease states (Tokuraku2010MicrotubuleAssociated; West1991A).

## Structure
MAP4 (microtubule-associated protein 4) is a protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules within cells. The primary structure of MAP4 is encoded by a single gene and consists of a sequence of amino acids that includes several distinct domains. The protein features an amino-terminal acidic domain and a carboxyl-terminal microtubule-binding domain, which is subdivided into three regions: the proline-rich region, the repeat region, and the tail region (Tokuraku2010MicrotubuleAssociated; Aizawa1991Functional).

The secondary structure of MAP4 includes alpha helices, particularly within the KDM repeat motifs, which are predicted to form short alpha helices interrupted by prolines, contributing to a filamentous but flexible structure (West1991A). The tertiary structure of MAP4 is characterized by its elongated form, with potential phosphorylation sites that may influence its rigidity and length (West1991A).

MAP4 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are important for its function and regulation during the cell cycle (West1991A). The protein is expressed in various isoforms due to alternative RNA splicing, which is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental manner (Tokuraku2010MicrotubuleAssociated). These isoforms contribute to the diversity of MAP4's functional roles in different cellular contexts.

## Function
Microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. MAP4 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it binds to microtubules, influencing their dynamics and organization (Tokuraku2010MicrotubuleAssociated; Chapin1994Cellular). It is involved in stimulating tubulin polymerization and stabilizing polymerized microtubules, similar to neural MAPs like MAP2 and tau (Tokuraku2010MicrotubuleAssociated). 

MAP4 contains several conserved domains, including a microtubule-binding domain that is divided into subdomains such as the Pro-rich region, which aids in microtubule nucleation, and the repeat region, which promotes elongation (Tokuraku2010MicrotubuleAssociated; West1991A). The protein is encoded by a single gene in humans, and its heterogeneity is due to alternative splicing and post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can modulate its interaction with microtubules (Chapin1994Cellular; West1991A).

MAP4 is expressed in various tissues and is involved in fundamental cellular processes such as mitosis, intracellular transport, and cell shape determination (Aizawa1991Functional). It is also crucial for the assembly and stabilization of microtubules during the formation of specialized structures like the immunological synapse in T cells (BustosMorán2017Microtubuleassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MAP4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. MAP4 phosphorylation is linked to pathological cardiac remodeling, which can lead to heart failure. This remodeling involves changes such as cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, often triggered by stress conditions like hypoxia or myocardial infarction (Li2018Microtubule). In patients with Tetralogy of Fallot and in mouse models, elevated MAP4 phosphorylation was observed, suggesting its role in cardiac pathologies (Li2018Microtubule).

The phosphorylation of MAP4 at specific sites, such as S737 and S760, is mediated by the p38/MAPK signaling pathway and leads to microtubule disassembly and mitochondrial dysfunction. This contributes to increased apoptosis and cardiac remodeling (Li2018Microtubule; Li2019Cardiac). In MAP4 knock-in mice, these changes result in age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, highlighting the gene's potential as a therapeutic target (Li2018Microtubule).

MAP4's role extends to mitochondrial dysfunction, where its phosphorylation affects proteins involved in mitochondrial apoptosis and the respiratory chain, further linking it to cardiomyopathy (Li2019Cardiac). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MAP4 in cardiac diseases and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
MAP4 (microtubule associated protein 4) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and stability. One significant interaction is with septins, a family of GTP-binding proteins. MAP4 binds to septins through its proline-rich domain (PRD), specifically interacting with the Sept2:Sept6:Sept7 heterotrimer. This interaction inhibits MAP4's ability to bind and bundle microtubules, thereby regulating microtubule stability (Kremer2005Mammalian).

MAP4 also interacts with the dynactin complex, particularly the p150 Glued subunit, which is involved in microtubule-based transport. This interaction does not involve direct binding to motor proteins like kinesin-2 or dynein but suggests a regulatory role in transport processes (Semenova2014Regulation).

In the context of type I interferon signaling, MAP4 interacts with butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1). This interaction is crucial for the dynein-dependent trafficking of BTN3A1 to the perinuclear region, facilitating the activation of the TBK1–IRF3 signaling axis, which is essential for antiviral responses (Seo2016MAP4regulated).

These interactions highlight MAP4's role in modulating microtubule dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways.
