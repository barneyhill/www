# ALX3

## Overview
The ALX3 gene encodes the ALX homeobox 3 protein, a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors, which are pivotal in regulating gene expression during development. The ALX3 protein is characterized by a homeodomain, a conserved sequence that facilitates DNA binding, and is classified as a transcription factor due to its role in modulating the transcription of target genes (Bürglin2011Homeodomain). ALX3 is particularly significant in the regulation of insulin gene transcription in pancreatic β-cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis (Mirasierra2006The; Mirasierra2010Alx3deficient). Mutations in the ALX3 gene are linked to frontonasal dysplasia, a condition marked by craniofacial malformations, highlighting its importance in normal facial development (Twigg2009Frontorhiny). The gene's location on chromosome 1 and its involvement in various developmental processes underscore its critical role in both metabolic and structural development (Twigg2009Frontorhiny).

## Structure
The ALX3 protein is a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors, characterized by a homeodomain, which is a highly conserved 60 amino acid sequence responsible for DNA binding (Twigg2009Frontorhiny). This domain consists of three alpha helices, with helix III playing a crucial role in DNA interaction (Bürglin2011Homeodomain). The tertiary structure of ALX3 is stabilized by interactions such as a buried salt bridge between conserved residues, which is essential for maintaining its structural integrity and function (Twigg2009Frontorhiny). 

The ALX3 protein does not appear to have a quaternary structure involving dimerization, as mutations at equivalent positions in other homeodomain proteins have shown a loss of dimerization (Twigg2009Frontorhiny). The protein is part of the Paired class of homeodomain proteins and shares homology with other genes, including ALX4 and Cart1, particularly in the homeodomain and a 16-amino-acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus known as the aristaless domain (Wimmer2002Combined). No splice variant isoforms or common post-translational modifications significantly altering its function have been identified (Twigg2009Frontorhiny).

## Function
The ALX3 gene encodes a homeoprotein that plays a significant role in the regulation of insulin gene transcription in pancreatic β-cells. ALX3 is expressed in these cells and interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix protein E47/Pan1 to promote the transactivation of the insulin gene. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of the insulin promoter, as ALX3 binds to the A3/4 site in the insulin promoter, often as a dimer, enhancing the recruitment of other transcription factors like Beta2/NeuroD (Mirasierra2006The). The homeodomain of ALX3 is sufficient to facilitate this interaction, although its proline-rich domains are important for its transactivation function (Mirasierra2006The).

In addition to its role in insulin regulation, ALX3 is involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis. In Alx3-deficient mice, there is an increase in blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance, despite normal serum insulin concentrations. This deficiency leads to reduced expression of insulin, glucagon, and glucokinase in pancreatic islets, decreased insulin secretion, increased apoptosis, and reduced beta cell mass (Mirasierra2010Alx3deficient). These findings suggest that ALX3 is crucial for the regulation of essential genes for pancreatic islet function and glucose homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALX3 gene are associated with frontonasal dysplasia, a condition characterized by craniofacial malformations. This condition, specifically termed "frontorhiny," includes features such as hypertelorism, a wide nasal bridge, a bifid nasal tip, and a midline notch in the upper lip. These phenotypic manifestations result from homozygous pathogenic mutations in the ALX3 gene, including missense substitutions, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, which lead to severe or complete loss of function of the ALX3 protein (Twigg2009Frontorhiny).

The ALX3 gene is located on chromosome 1 at band 1p13.3 and encodes a transcription factor essential for normal facial development. The mutations in ALX3 disrupt its DNA-binding capability, resulting in the distinctive craniofacial abnormalities observed in affected individuals (Twigg2009Frontorhiny). In addition to frontonasal dysplasia, ALX3 deficiency in humans has been linked to other congenital anomalies, such as intellectual disability, ankyloglossia, hearing loss, and agenesis of the corpus callosum, although metabolic alterations have not been reported (Mirasierra2024Alx3). These findings underscore the critical role of ALX3 in craniofacial development and its potential involvement in broader developmental disorders.

## Interactions
ALX3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms homodimers and heterodimers, which are crucial for its function. The homeodomain of ALX3 is necessary and sufficient for both DNA binding and homodimerization, allowing it to form complexes on specific TAAT-containing DNA sites, such as those in the promoters of somatostatin and GFAP genes (PérezVillamil2004The).

In pancreatic β-cells, ALX3 interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix protein E47/Pan1 to regulate insulin gene transcription. This interaction occurs at the insulin promoter, where ALX3 binds to the A3/4 site, facilitating the recruitment of E47/Pan1 and forming a transcriptionally active complex. ALX3 does not directly interact with Beta2/NeuroD but can form a trimeric complex through E47/Pan1, which acts as a bridging protein (Mirasierra2006The).

In mouse alpha cells, ALX3 interacts with PAX6, forming heterodimers that bind to the G3 site on the glucagon promoter. This interaction sequesters PAX6, reducing its ability to activate the glucagon promoter at the G1 site, thereby downregulating glucagon gene expression in response to elevated glucose levels (Mirasierra2016Glucosedependent).
