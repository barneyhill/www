# TCF15

## Overview
TCF15, or transcription factor 15, is a gene that encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. The protein product of TCF15, also referred to as Paraxis, plays a pivotal role in the specification of mesodermal derivatives, including processes such as myogenesis and somitogenesis. As a transcription factor, TCF15 functions by binding to E-box sequences in DNA, thereby influencing the expression of target genes. Notably, TCF15 forms heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as MEOX2, to regulate the identity and function of heart capillary endothelial cells, particularly in the context of fatty acid uptake and transport. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cardiac energy metabolism and has implications for heart function and disease (Torres-Machorro2021Homodimeric; Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15).

## Structure


## Function
TCF15, also known as Paraxis, is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. It is involved in the specification of mesodermal derivatives, influencing processes such as myogenesis and somitogenesis. TCF15 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to E-box sequences in DNA to regulate target genes (Yang2015Coronary).

In the context of cardiac function, TCF15 forms heterodimers with MEOX2, another transcription factor, to regulate the identity of heart capillary endothelial cells (ECs) and their involvement in fatty acid (FA) uptake. This heterodimeric complex is crucial for the expression of genes related to lipid binding and FA transport, such as CD36 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), facilitating FA transport across heart ECs (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15). The cooperative interaction between TCF15 and MEOX2 is essential for maintaining the specific gene expression profile of heart ECs, particularly in relation to FA transport, which is vital for cardiac function (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15).

TCF15 also plays a role in haematopoiesis, as revealed by single-cell lineage tracing studies, although its specific function in healthy human cells outside of these contexts is not extensively documented (RodriguezFraticelli2020Singlecell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TCF15 gene have been studied in relation to coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiac function. While TCF15 alone has not shown a direct association with CHD risk, its interaction with the MEOX2 gene may have clinical significance. Specifically, the presence of certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF15, such as rs12624577, in combination with MEOX2 variants, has been linked to an increased risk of CHD, suggesting a potential interaction effect between these genes (Yang2015Coronary).

The TCF15 gene, as part of the Meox2/Tcf15 heterodimer, plays a crucial role in regulating fatty acid uptake in heart capillary endothelial cells. Deficiencies in these genes can lead to impaired fatty acid transport, which may result in altered cardiac energy metabolism and contribute to cardiac dysfunction, particularly in aged mice (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15). Although direct evidence linking TCF15 mutations to specific clinical diseases in humans is limited, the gene's role in cardiac fatty acid uptake and energy metabolism suggests that alterations could potentially impact heart function and contribute to conditions such as cardiac fibrosis or dysfunction (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15). Further research is needed to explore these associations and their implications for human health.

## Interactions
TCF15, also known as transcription factor 15, is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through dimerization. It is classified under Group A, Class II bHLH transcription factors, indicating its role in tissue-specific expression and potential for heterodimerization (Torres-Machorro2021Homodimeric). TCF15 can form heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as Meox2, to regulate gene expression in heart capillary endothelial cells. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of fatty acid uptake and transport, as demonstrated by the cooperative effect of Meox2 and TCF15 in upregulating genes involved in cardiac fatty acid uptake (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15).

The Meox2/TCF15 heterodimer is particularly important in programming the heart capillary endothelium for fatty acid uptake, influencing the expression of genes like CD36 and lipoprotein lipase, which are involved in fatty acid transport across endothelial cells (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15). This interaction highlights the role of TCF15 in cardiac energy metabolism and its potential impact on heart function and disease (Coppiello2015Meox2Tcf15).
