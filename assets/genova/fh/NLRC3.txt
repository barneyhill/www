# NLRC3

## Overview
NLRC3 is a gene that encodes the protein NLR family CARD domain containing 3, which is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. This protein is characterized by its caspase recruitment domain (CARD), nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions, which collectively contribute to its role as a cytoplasmic sensor and regulator of immune responses (Eren2017NLRC3; Hochheiser2023Structural). NLRC3 functions primarily as a negative regulator of immune signaling pathways, including the inhibition of inflammasome assembly and modulation of NF-κB and type I interferon responses (Eren2017NLRC3; Sun2022Negative). Through these mechanisms, NLRC3 plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation, which is crucial for protecting against autoimmune diseases and certain cancers (Li2019Viral; Karki2017NLRC3).

## Structure
The NLRC3 protein is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and is characterized by a specific domain architecture. It comprises a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions (Eren2017NLRC3). The CARD domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins involved in inflammasome assembly, such as ASC and pro-caspase-1, playing a role in inhibiting the NALP3 inflammasome (Eren2017NLRC3). The NBD, also known as the NACHT domain, is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, featuring conserved motifs such as Walker A and Walker B, which are important for its ATPase activity (Li2019Viral; Hochheiser2023Structural).

The LRR domain is responsible for binding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and is crucial for the protein's function as a nucleic acid sensor. This domain has a positively charged surface that facilitates interaction with negatively charged DNA, and the first four LRRs are primarily responsible for DNA binding (Li2019Viral). The binding of dsDNA to the LRR domain enhances the ATPase activity of the NBD, leading to the activation of immune signaling pathways (Li2019Viral).

The tertiary structure of NLRC3 involves the overall 3D conformation of these domains, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided in the context. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural modeling have been used to study the protein's conformation and interactions (Li2019Viral).

## Function
NLRC3 is a negative regulator of immune signaling, primarily active in the cytoplasm of healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating inflammatory responses. NLRC3 inhibits the assembly of the NALP3 inflammasome by competing with the adaptor protein ASC for binding to pro-caspase-1, thereby preventing the formation of ASC specks, which are indicative of inflammasome activation (Eren2017NLRC3). This interaction is crucial for its function in disrupting inflammasome assembly, leading to reduced activation of caspase-1 and decreased levels of mature IL-1β (Gültekin2014Overexpressed).

NLRC3 also downregulates NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity, which is typically upregulated by NOD1 and NOD2 proteins, acting as a negative regulator of this pathway (Gültekin2014Overexpressed). It interacts with STING and TBK1, preventing their interaction and trafficking, which is crucial for regulating type I interferon production (Sun2022Negative). By modulating these pathways, NLRC3 prevents excessive immune responses that could lead to tissue damage or autoimmune diseases, highlighting its role in maintaining immune balance and preventing unnecessary inflammation (Li2019Viral; Zhang2014NLRC3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NLRC3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autoimmune diseases, NLRC3 acts as a negative regulator in dendritic cells, influencing the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 subsets. Deficiency in NLRC3 expression leads to enhanced antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells, exacerbating conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (Fu2019NLRC).

In Alzheimer's disease, rare variants in the NLRC3 gene are associated with increased neuronal injury and inflammation. These variants are linked to elevated levels of inflammatory markers and are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's by enhancing neurodegeneration and dementia symptoms (Neumann2022Rare).

NLRC3 also plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. It negatively regulates the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway, and its deficiency leads to increased tumorigenesis due to enhanced cellular proliferation and reduced apoptosis. This suggests that NLRC3 acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC (Karki2017NLRC3).

Additionally, NLRC3 mutations have been identified in patients with unclassified autoinflammatory syndromes, where they lead to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and enhanced NF-kB activation (Kosukcu2020Whole).

## Interactions
NLRC3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in modulating immune responses. It physically associates with pro-caspase-1 and caspase-5, forming inflammasome-like complexes with ASC and caspase-1. This interaction inhibits the assembly and activation of the NALP3 inflammasome by competing with ASC for pro-caspase-1 binding, thereby reducing IL-1β secretion (Eren2017NLRC3; Gültekin2014Overexpressed).

NLRC3 also interacts with TRAF6, inhibiting K63-linked ubiquitination, which is crucial for activating downstream inflammatory pathways like NF-κB. This interaction results in decreased NF-κB activation and reduced inflammation (Li2020NLRC3).

In the context of viral infections, NLRC3 binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from viruses through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. This binding disrupts its interaction with STING, a receptor that activates type I interferon responses, thereby modulating the immune response to viral DNA (Li2019Viral; Zhang2014NLRC3).

NLRC3's interaction with STING and TBK1 is crucial for regulating type I interferon production. It reduces the association between STING and TBK1, thereby inhibiting the induction of interferons in response to intracellular DNA (Zhang2014NLRC3).
