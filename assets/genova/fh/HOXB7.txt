# HOXB7

## Overview
HOXB7 is a gene that encodes the homeobox B7 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The HOXB7 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and in maintaining genomic integrity through interactions with DNA repair machinery (Cavalcante2010675; Bondos2020Contextdependent). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and NF-κB family members, which enhance its transcriptional activity (Chariot1999CBP; Chariot1999The). Aberrant expression of HOXB7 is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital malformations, underscoring its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Nguyen2012HOXB7; Rochtus2015DNA; Zhou2021Differential).

## Structure
The HOXB7 protein is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor involved in transcriptional activation. Its primary structure includes distinct domains: an N-terminal domain, a pentapeptide domain, a homeodomain, and an acidic C-terminal tail (Chariot1999CBP). The homeodomain is responsible for DNA binding, a characteristic feature of homeobox proteins (Chariot1999CBP). The N-terminal domain is crucial for transactivation, as its deletion reduces activity, and it is necessary for interaction with the coactivator CBP (Chariot1999CBP). The C-terminal acidic tail also plays a significant role in transactivation (Chariot1999CBP).

Post-translational modifications of HOXB7 include poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which affects the glutamate-rich C-terminal tail, decreasing DNA binding affinity (Draime2018Posttranslational). Phosphorylation is another modification, with specific residues such as S132, S133, T203, and T204 being targets for CKII phosphorylation, influencing differentiation processes (Draime2018Posttranslational). These modifications do not affect the nuclear localization of the protein (Draime2018Posttranslational). The interaction of HOXB7 with CBP and other transcription factors is essential for its function, highlighting the importance of its structural domains in mediating these interactions (Chariot1999CBP).

## Function
HOXB7 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during development. In healthy human cells, HOXB7 is involved in stimulating the proliferation and survival of progenitor cells, which is crucial for normal development and tissue maintenance (Cavalcante2010675). It interacts with proteins related to the DNA repair machinery, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic integrity (Bondos2020Contextdependent). 

HOXB7 is expressed in the basal cells of normal epithelium, indicating its role in normal cell proliferation (Cavalcante2010675). It is also involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, particularly in promoting the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells towards a smooth muscle cell phenotype (Bostr�m2000HOXB7). This function is supported by its ability to induce early smooth muscle cell markers, such as calponin and SM22α, in certain cell types (Bostr�m2000HOXB7).

In the context of the mammary gland, HOXB7 expression is regulated by extracellular matrix-dependent signals and is involved in ductal branching during development (Srebrow1998Expression). This highlights its role in tissue organization and development, contributing to the proper formation and function of organs.

## Clinical Significance
HOXB7 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In neural tube defects (NTDs), particularly myelomeningocele, HOXB7 hypomethylation is associated with increased gene expression, suggesting a potential risk factor for these congenital malformations (Rochtus2015DNA). In cancer, HOXB7 overexpression is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis across multiple types. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HOXB7 is frequently overexpressed, promoting invasion and metastasis, and correlating with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival (Nguyen2012HOXB7). In breast cancer, particularly HER-2-positive subtypes, high HOXB7 expression is a strong prognostic marker for metastasis and decreased survival (Chen2008Hoxb7). HOXB7 also plays a role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), where its overexpression enhances migration, invasion, and metastasis through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (Dai2019Upregulated). In gliomas, HOXB7 expression is upregulated in more aggressive tumors, serving as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival (Zhou2021Differential). These findings highlight HOXB7's significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HOXB7, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, engages in several significant protein-protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One of the key interactions is with the CREB-binding protein (CBP), a coactivator that enhances HOXB7's transactivation potential. This interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo and requires the N-terminal domain of HOXB7 and specific domains of CBP, such as the C/H3 and Q-rich domains. The interaction is crucial for HOXB7's transcriptional activity, as demonstrated by increased luciferase activity in cotransfection experiments with CBP (Chariot1999CBP).

HOXB7 also interacts with NF-κB family members, which significantly increase its transactivation potential. This interaction involves the N-terminal domain of HOXB7 and occurs independently of DNA, suggesting a protein-protein interaction. Additionally, HOXB7 interacts with IκB-α, an inhibitor of NF-κB, through its N-terminal domain and the ankyrin repeats and C-terminal region of IκB-α (Chariot1999The).

These interactions highlight the role of HOXB7 in transcription regulation and its involvement in complex signaling pathways, which are critical for understanding its function in development and disease.
