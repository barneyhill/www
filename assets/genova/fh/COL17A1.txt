# COL17A1

## Overview
The COL17A1 gene encodes the collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity of epithelial tissues. This protein is a crucial component of hemidesmosomes, which are specialized structures that anchor epithelial cells to the basement membrane, thereby maintaining the adhesion between the epidermis and dermis (Nishimura2015Extracellular; Franzke2002Transmembrane). The collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a collagenous domain with Gly-X-Y repeats and a non-collagenous NC16A domain, contributing to its functional properties (van2006Two). The protein's interactions with integrins and other cell adhesion molecules are essential for its role in cell adhesion, migration, and the maintenance of skin integrity (Sproule2023Functional; Franzke2002Transmembrane). Mutations in the COL17A1 gene are linked to various skin disorders, including junctional epidermolysis bullosa, highlighting its clinical significance (Pasmooij2007Localized; Floeth1998Novel).

## Structure
The COL17A1 gene encodes the collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain, a type II transmembrane protein crucial for hemidesmosome function in epithelial cells. The primary structure of this protein includes a long collagenous domain characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats, which are essential for its structural integrity (van2006Two). The secondary structure features a triple-helical configuration, formed by the folding of its collagenous subdomains (COL1-COL15) into a helical structure (van2006Two). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the protein includes a non-collagenous NC16A domain, which plays a role in its functional properties. The quaternary structure of collagen type XVII involves the formation of homotrimers, which are critical for its role in maintaining the structural integrity of hemidesmosomes (van2006Two). 

Post-translational modifications of the collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are important for its stability and function. The protein is also known as BP180, reflecting its estimated molecular weight of 180 kDa (van2006Two). These structural features are vital for its role in connecting epithelial basal cells to the underlying basement membrane.

## Function
The COL17A1 gene encodes collagen XVII, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, collagen XVII is a major component of hemidesmosomes, which are structures that anchor basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane, ensuring stable adhesion between the epidermis and dermis (Nishimura2015Extracellular; Franzke2002Transmembrane). The protein is organized into a trimer of three 180 kDa α1(XVII) chains, featuring a globular intracellular N-terminal domain, a short transmembrane domain, and an extracellular C-terminal domain (Franzke2002Transmembrane).

Collagen XVII interacts with integrins, such as the β4-integrin subunit, which is essential for its incorporation into hemidesmosomes, and the α6-integrin subunit, which binds to the extracellular NC16A domain (Franzke2002Transmembrane). This interaction is vital for the structural integrity and adhesion of epithelial cells. The protein also plays a role in cell adhesion and migration, with its ectodomain shedding influencing keratinocyte adhesion, differentiation, and migration (Franzke2002Transmembrane). Proper glycosylation and membrane targeting of collagen XVII are crucial for its function, as they affect the protein's interaction with other cell adhesion molecules like laminin 5 (Franzke2006Cterminal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL17A1 gene, which encodes collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain, are associated with several skin disorders, primarily junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). JEB is characterized by skin blistering due to defects in the adhesion of the epidermis to the dermis. Different mutations in COL17A1 can lead to various forms of JEB, including generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GABEB) and localized JEB. These conditions manifest with symptoms such as skin blistering, atrophy, alopecia, nail dystrophy, and dental anomalies (Pasmooij2007Localized; Floeth1998Novel).

In non-Herlitz JEB, a milder variant, mutations like the homozygous nonsense mutation R795X result in the production of a splice variant that allows for limited synthesis of type XVII collagen, contributing to a less severe phenotype (Ruzzi2001A). Mutations in COL17A1 are also linked to epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy (ERED), a condition affecting the cornea, with symptoms such as recurrent corneal erosions and photophobia. The p.Thr939Ile mutation in COL17A1 is associated with a dominant form of ERED, distinct from the recessive skin disorder EB (Jonsson2015Mutations). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of COL17A1 mutations.

## Interactions
The COL17A1 protein, also known as collagen XVII, is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the skin through its interactions with various proteins. Its intracellular domain interacts with the epithelial isoform of dystonin (DST-E), plectin, and integrin β4, linking the keratin cytoskeleton to hemidesmosomes. These interactions are essential for maintaining the connection between the epidermis and the underlying dermis (Sproule2023Functional).

The extracellular domain of COL17A1, known as ectoCOLXVII, binds to laminin 332 (L332), strengthening basal keratinocyte adhesions to the basement membrane. This binding is crucial for the structural integrity of the skin, as L332 forms a bridge between integrin α6β4 heterodimers in hemidesmosomes and collagen VII anchoring fibrils in the dermis (Sproule2023Functional). Mutations in COL17A1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), characterized by skin blistering due to weakened dermal-epidermal adhesion (Sproule2023Functional).

In the context of oncogenic transformations, COL17A1 interacts with CD44, where CD44 regulates the membrane accumulation of COL17A1 in multilayered epithelia. This interaction is significant in the formation of multilayered epithelial structures during oncogenic transformations (Kozawa2021The).
