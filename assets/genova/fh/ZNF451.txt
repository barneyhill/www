# ZNF451

## Overview
ZNF451 is a gene located on chromosome 6p12.1 in humans, encoding the zinc finger protein 451, which is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. As a member of the zinc finger protein family, ZNF451 is characterized by its Krüppel-like C2H2-type zinc fingers and a C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motif, which contribute to its role as a SUMO E3 ligase (Karvonen2008ZNF451). This protein is integral to the SUMOylation pathway, specifically interacting with SUMO2 and UBC9, and is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, such as p53, thereby influencing protein function and stability (Cappadocia2015Structural). Beyond its enzymatic functions, ZNF451 also acts as a transcriptional coregulator, participating in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, and is implicated in the resolution of topoisomerase 2 DNA-protein cross-links, which is vital for genomic stability (Schellenberg2017ZATT). The clinical significance of ZNF451 is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and various cancers, where alterations in its expression can affect disease progression and treatment outcomes (Zhang2018LncRNA; Peng2024Loss).

## Structure
ZNF451 is a protein encoded by the human ZNF451 gene, located on chromosome 6p12.1. The protein consists of 1061 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 121 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.3 (Karvonen2008ZNF451). It contains 11 Krüppel-like C2H2-type zinc fingers and a C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) (Karvonen2008ZNF451). The N-terminal domain includes residues 2-56 and encompasses two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), which are crucial for its role as a SUMO E3 ligase (Cappadocia2015Structural). 

The protein's structure is characterized by a potential coiled-coil region between amino acids 81 and 109 and a consensus sumoylation site at amino acid 706 (Karvonen2008ZNF451). ZNF451 interacts with SUMO2 and UBC9, forming a complex that includes two SUMO2 molecules and one UBC9 molecule, highlighting its role in SUMOylation processes (Cappadocia2015Structural). 

ZNF451 undergoes post-translational modifications, including sumoylation at nonconsensus lysine residues within its N-terminal region, which affects its localization and function (Karvonen2008ZNF451). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, with isoform 1 being the full-length version (Karvonen2008ZNF451).

## Function
ZNF451 is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a SUMO E3 ligase, facilitating the transfer of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) proteins to substrates, which is crucial for regulating protein function and stability. ZNF451 is particularly specific to SUMO2 and is involved in the SUMOylation of proteins such as p53, influencing post-translational modification processes (Cappadocia2015Structural).

ZNF451 is also involved in the resolution of topoisomerase 2 DNA-protein cross-links (TOP2cc) by enhancing the activity of TDP2, an enzyme that hydrolyzes these cross-links. This function is critical for maintaining genomic stability and cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly in the context of anticancer drug treatments targeting TOP2 (Schellenberg2017ZATT).

In addition to its role in SUMOylation, ZNF451 acts as a transcriptional coregulator associated with PML nuclear bodies, influencing transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with the sumoylation machinery and other proteins like HDAC4, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses (Karvonen2008ZNF451).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF451 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of fibrosis and cancer. In pulmonary fibrosis, the loss of ZNF451 expression is associated with increased fibroblast activation and progression of the disease. Studies have shown that ZNF451 expression is downregulated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma-associated pulmonary fibrosis (SSc-PF), correlating with disease severity and reduced lung function. In mouse models, ZNF451 knockout exacerbates fibrosis, while its overexpression mitigates the condition, suggesting its role as a repressor of fibroblast activation (Peng2024Loss).

In cancer, ZNF451 is involved in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In PDAC, the long non-coding RNA BC032020 targets ZNF451, and its overexpression suppresses tumor cell survival, indicating that ZNF451 may play a role in cancer cell proliferation and motility (Zhang2018LncRNA). In LUAD, exosomal circZNF451 is associated with resistance to anti-PD1 therapy. It influences macrophage polarization, contributing to an immune-suppressed tumor microenvironment, which impacts the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Gao2022Exosomal). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF451 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ZNF451 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a SUMO E3 ligase. It interacts with SUMO proteins, particularly SUMO2, enhancing the transfer of SUMO from E2 conjugating enzymes to substrates. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal domain of ZNF451, which contains tandem SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) and a Proline-Leucine-Arginine-Proline (PLRP) motif crucial for engaging the thioester-charged E2~SUMO complex (Cappadocia2015Structural).

ZNF451 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), with SUMO-1 enhancing this interaction. This interaction is weak but can be stabilized by SUMO-1, and PIAS1 can recruit ZNF451 to AR speckles, suggesting a role in modulating protein localization (Karvonen2008ZNF451).

Additionally, ZNF451 interacts with PIAS proteins, although these interactions do not enhance ZNF451 sumoylation. PIAS1 influences the nuclear distribution of ZNF451, causing it to form granules and speckles throughout the nucleoplasm (Karvonen2008ZNF451).

ZNF451 is also involved in the sumoylation of PML and its components, with ZNF451-1, a specific isoform, acting as a SUMO2/3 specific E3 ligase for PML, regulating its stability and the number of PML bodies (Koidl2016The).
