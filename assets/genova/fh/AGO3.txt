# AGO3

## Overview
AGO3 is a gene that encodes the protein argonaute RISC catalytic component 3, a member of the Argonaute protein family, which plays a pivotal role in RNA interference and gene silencing mechanisms. As a catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the AGO3 protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the binding of small RNAs to target mRNAs, leading to their degradation or translational repression. Unlike its well-characterized counterpart AGO2, AGO3 was initially thought to lack catalytic activity; however, recent studies have revealed that it possesses slicer activity under specific conditions, dependent on the guide RNA and target RNA flanking regions (Park2017Human). Structurally, AGO3 is characterized by conserved domains such as the PAZ and PIWI domains, with the latter containing a DEDH catalytic tetrad essential for its RNA cleavage function (Müller2020Argonaute). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids are crucial for its role in gene regulation, impacting processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation (Meister2013Argonaute). Additionally, AGO3 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer progression and stem cell regulation, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Hu2012DICER-; Pan2021Argonaute).

## Structure
AGO3, a member of the Argonaute protein family, is characterized by its distinct molecular structure, which includes several conserved domains: the N-terminal domain (N), the PAZ domain, the MID domain, and the PIWI domain. The PAZ domain anchors the 3' end of small RNAs, while the PIWI domain contains a DEDH catalytic tetrad, similar to AGO2, enabling RNA cleavage activity (Müller2020Argonaute; Wu2020Argonaute). AGO3's PIWI domain is fully functional, but its slicer activity is dependent on specific guide RNAs and target RNA flanking regions (Park2017Human).

AGO3 has unique structural features, such as a wider nucleic acid-binding channel due to a disordered insertion in the N domain, which affects its target cleavage efficiency compared to AGO2 (Park2017Human). The N domain also contains 13 unique residues near the 3SI region, contributing to AGO3's distinct target specificity (Nakanishi2022Anatomy). The structural rigidity of AGO3 is influenced by motifs I and II, which form a hydrophobic core affecting the packing between the N and L1/L2 domains (Park2017Human).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate AGO3's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context (Wu2020Argonaute). The presence of splice variant isoforms, such as a short AGO3 isoform with a mutation affecting the L2 domain, suggests potential functional diversity (Nakanishi2022Anatomy).

## Function
AGO3, a member of the Argonaute protein family, plays a significant role in RNA interference and gene silencing processes in human cells. It is involved in the formation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which facilitates the binding of small RNAs to target mRNAs, leading to their degradation or translational repression. Unlike AGO2, which is well-known for its slicer activity, AGO3 was traditionally considered non-catalytic. However, recent studies have demonstrated that AGO3 does possess slicer activity, although it is dependent on the specific guide RNA used. For instance, AGO3 can cleave RNA targets when loaded with miR-20a, but not with other guide RNAs like let-7a or miR-16 (Park2017Human).

AGO3's slicer activity is influenced by the seed sequence of the guide RNA and requires both 5' and 3' flanking regions for effective cleavage, unlike AGO2, which can cleave targets without these regions (Park2017Human). This suggests that AGO3 may have distinct roles in gene regulation, potentially contributing to processes such as development and differentiation (Park2017Human). AGO3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it regulates gene expression, impacting cellular differentiation, proliferation, and development (Meister2013Argonaute).

## Clinical Significance
Argonaute 3 (AGO3) has been implicated in the progression of cervical cancer. Studies have shown that AGO3 expression is significantly elevated in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal samples, and this upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis (Pan2021Argonaute). The high expression of AGO3 in cervical cancer is linked to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which promotes malignancy by enhancing cell proliferation, colony formation, and mobility. Silencing AGO3 in cervical cancer cell lines results in decreased cancer cell growth and mobility, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pan2021Argonaute).

In the context of human stem cells, AGO3 is involved in the regulation of stem cell proliferation through its interaction with retinoic acid-induced DR2 Alu RNAs. AGO3 stabilizes these RNAs, which are crucial for the post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. This process is essential for the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of stem cells, indicating that alterations in AGO3 function could impact stem cell behavior and potentially contribute to diseases related to stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Hu2012DICER-).

## Interactions
AGO3, a member of the Argonaute protein family, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in RNA silencing processes. AGO3 interacts with small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is involved in gene regulation by targeting mRNA for cleavage or translational repression (Meister2013Argonaute).

AGO3 is known to bind with proteins from the GW family, such as TNRC6B, which facilitate the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex for mRNA deadenylation. This interaction is mediated by conserved tryptophan residues in TNRC6B, which bind to AGO proteins, including AGO3 (Pfaff2013Structural). AGO3 also interacts with RNA-binding proteins like Pumilio, which enhance miRNA activity by stabilizing the miRNA-mRNA interaction (Meister2013Argonaute).

In the context of piRNA pathways, AGO3 cooperates with Piwi proteins in Drosophila melanogaster for secondary piRNA production, playing a role in transposon silencing in the germ line (Meister2013Argonaute). These interactions highlight AGO3's involvement in complex regulatory networks essential for maintaining gene expression homeostasis.
