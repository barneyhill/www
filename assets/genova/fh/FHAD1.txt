# FHAD1

## Overview
FHAD1 is a gene that encodes the protein forkhead associated phosphopeptide binding domain 1, which is characterized by the presence of a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. This domain is integral to the protein's ability to bind phosphopeptides, a function that is crucial in various cellular processes, including those related to ciliary functions and immune activation (Cury2022Conservation; Lindskog2024A). While the detailed molecular structure of the FHAD1 protein remains to be fully elucidated, its FHA domain is known to adopt a β-sandwich structure, which is typical of proteins involved in signaling pathways and protein-protein interactions (Cury2022Conservation). The protein's role in these biological processes suggests it may interact with other proteins, although specific interaction partners and post-translational modifications have yet to be comprehensively identified. Further research is necessary to understand the full scope of FHAD1's functions and its implications in human health and disease.

## Structure
The FHAD1 protein contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is known for its role in binding phosphopeptides. FHA domains typically exhibit a β-sandwich structure, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Cury2022Conservation). The molecular structure of FHAD1 is not extensively detailed in the available literature, but it is noted for its involvement in cellular processes related to ciliary functions and immune activation (Cury2022Conservation; Lindskog2024A). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function of FHA domains, although specific modifications for FHAD1 are not detailed in the provided context (Cury2022Conservation). The protein's role in various biological processes suggests potential interactions with other proteins, but specific details on its quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms are not available in the current context. 

Overall, while the FHA domain is a prominent feature of FHAD1, further research is needed to fully elucidate its complete molecular structure and functional implications in human biology.
