# GLIS2

## Overview
GLIS2 is a gene that encodes the GLIS family zinc finger 2 protein, a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain, which includes five tandem Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Kim2005Kruppellike; Zhang2001Genomic). GLIS2 functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, playing a crucial role in various biological processes, including kidney development and disease (1 page 3 of 21). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with other nuclear proteins to form transcriptional complexes that modulate gene expression (Kim2005Kruppellike). GLIS2 is involved in key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications like phosphorylation (Vasanth2011Identification; Kim2007The). The gene's expression is most abundant in the kidney, where it is essential for maintaining normal renal function and preventing chronic kidney diseases (Kim2008KrüppelLike).

## Structure
The GLIS2 protein is a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor family and is characterized by its zinc finger domain, which includes five tandem Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs. These motifs are crucial for DNA binding and are defined by the consensus sequence X-Cys-X2,4-Cys-X12,15-His-X3,4-His-X (Kim2005Kruppellike; Zhang2001Genomic). The zinc finger domain of GLIS2 shows high homology with the GLI and ZIC subfamilies, particularly GLI1, but forms a distinct subfamily (Zhang2001Genomic).

The protein's nuclear localization is dependent on the third zinc finger (ZF3), specifically the region between amino acids 237-246, which is critical for nuclear retention (Vasanth2011Identification). GLIS2 can function as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, with its N-terminus containing transactivation and repressor functions (Kim2005Kruppellike). It interacts with co-transcriptional repressor protein CtBP1, recruiting histone deacetylases to repress transcription (Kim2005Kruppellike; 1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser 245, affect GLIS2's DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Vasanth2011Identification). The protein is implicated in various biological processes, including kidney development and disease (1 page 3 of 21).

## Function
GLIS2 (GLIS family zinc finger 2) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in maintaining normal kidney architecture and function. It is part of the Gli-similar (Glis) subfamily of Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins and functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. In healthy cells, GLIS2 regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences known as Glis binding sequences (GlisBS) (Vasanth2011Identification). This binding is facilitated by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA binding ability and transcriptional regulation (Vasanth2011Identification).

GLIS2 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with other nuclear proteins, such as CtBP1, to form transcriptional complexes that can either activate or repress target genes (Kim2005Kruppellike). It is involved in modulating signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, where it acts as a negative modulator by interacting with β-catenin and inhibiting its transcriptional activity (Kim2007The). This regulatory function is essential for preventing processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is critical in renal fibrosis development (kang2010similar).

GLIS2's activity is also modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Vasanth2011Identification). Its expression is most abundant in the kidney, where it is crucial for maintaining normal renal function and preventing chronic kidney diseases like nephronophthisis (Kim2008KrüppelLike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GLIS2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably nephronophthisis and certain cancers. Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive kidney disease characterized by corticomedullary cysts and progressive renal failure. Mutations in GLIS2, such as a novel in-frame deletion, have been associated with early onset kidney failure in nephronophthisis patients. This deletion affects the zinc-finger motif of the GLIS2 protein, potentially altering its DNA-binding capacity and leading to pathogenicity (Al2021Case). GLIS2 mutations in mice result in chronic kidney disease with features resembling nephronophthisis, including renal atrophy and fibrosis, indicating its critical role in maintaining renal function (Kim2008KrüppelLike).

In cancer, GLIS2 acts as an oncogene, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it represses enhancer activation of p53 target genes involved in apoptosis. Knockdown of GLIS2 increases apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer cell survival and metastasis. High GLIS2 expression is observed in various cancers, including pancreatic, colon, breast, and brain cancers, and is correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor survival rates in colon cancer patients (Yao2020GLIS2).

## Interactions
GLIS2, a member of the Gli-similar subfamily of Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factors, participates in several protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation. GLIS2 binds to specific DNA elements known as GlisBS within the Ins2 promoter, and mutations in these binding sites significantly reduce GLIS2-induced activation, indicating a direct interaction with DNA (Vasanth2011Identification). Phosphorylation of GLIS2 at Ser 245 is crucial for its DNA binding ability, with a phosphomimetic mutation (S245D) leading to a loss of DNA binding and transactivation activity (Vasanth2011Identification).

GLIS2 also interacts with several proteins, including p120 catenin, CtBP1, and β-catenin. It specifically binds to p120 catenin, leading to the cleavage of GLIS2 into a truncated form, Glis2 ΔC, which can still bind to p120 (Hosking2007The). GLIS2 interacts with CtBP1, a C-terminal binding protein, to mediate transcriptional repression. This interaction is specific to GLIS2 and involves the recruitment of CtBP1 and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) into a transcription silencing complex (Kim2005Kruppellike). GLIS2 also interacts with β-catenin, acting as a negative modulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by repressing β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activation (Kim2007The).
