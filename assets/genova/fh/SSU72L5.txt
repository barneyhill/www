# SSU72L5

## Overview
SSU72L5 is a gene that encodes the protein SSU72 like 5, which is part of the phosphatase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and RNA processing. As a phosphatase, SSU72 like 5 plays a critical role in dephosphorylating specific substrates, which is essential for the modulation of signaling pathways and cellular homeostasis. The gene and its encoded protein have been studied for their potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of SSU72L5 is crucial for elucidating its role in normal cellular physiology and its implications in disease states.
