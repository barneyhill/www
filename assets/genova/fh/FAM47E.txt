# FAM47E

## Overview
FAM47E is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 47, specifically member E. This protein is involved in the regulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a key enzyme in epigenetic modification processes. FAM47E enhances the stability and activity of PRMT5 by preventing its proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting its role in chromatin methylation and influencing gene expression (Chakrapani2020The). The protein is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its overexpression has been linked to increased cell proliferation and oncogenic potential, suggesting a significant role in cellular growth and cancer biology (Chakrapani2020The). While the precise physiological functions of FAM47E in normal cells are not fully understood, its interaction with PRMT5 highlights its importance in cellular processes and potential implications in disease pathology, including cancer and other conditions (Chakrapani2020The).

## Function
The FAM47E protein interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and plays a significant role in regulating its functions in human cells. FAM47E enhances the stability of PRMT5 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, which increases PRMT5's chromatin methylation activity (Chakrapani2020The). This interaction is crucial for PRMT5's role in epigenetic regulation through histone arginine methylation, affecting the expression of PRMT5 target genes (Chakrapani2020The). FAM47E promotes the chromatin association of PRMT5, leading to elevated levels of specific histone modifications, such as H3R2me2s, H3R8me2s, and H4R3me2s, which are mediated by PRMT5 (Chakrapani2020The).

FAM47E is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its overexpression enhances cell proliferation and clonogenic capacity via the PRMT5 axis (Chakrapani2020The). The protein's interaction with PRMT5 suggests that FAM47E acts as a regulator of PRMT5, promoting its functions and potentially contributing to oncogenic properties in cells by increasing cell proliferation (Chakrapani2020The). The specific role of FAM47E in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its interaction with PRMT5 indicates a significant regulatory function in cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM47E gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its interactions and expression levels. Genome-wide association studies have linked FAM47E to chronic kidney disease and Parkinson's disease, suggesting its potential role in these conditions (Chakrapani2020The). The gene's interaction with PRMT5, a protein involved in epigenetic regulation, is particularly significant. FAM47E enhances the stability and chromatin methylation activity of PRMT5, which can lead to increased cell proliferation and oncogenic properties (Chakrapani2020The). Elevated levels of FAM47E have been associated with increased cell proliferation and colony-forming capacity, indicating its potential oncogenic role when dysregulated (Chakrapani2020The).

In certain cancers, such as esophageal cancer, FAM47E is up-regulated even when PRMT5 is not, leading to the up-regulation of PRMT5 targets. This suggests that the FAM47E-PRMT5 interaction could be a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Chakrapani2020The). Disrupting this interaction may mitigate PRMT5's oncogenic functions, highlighting the clinical significance of FAM47E in cancer therapy (Chakrapani2020The). These findings underscore the importance of FAM47E in disease pathology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FAM47E, a human protein, has been identified as an interaction partner of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). This interaction was initially discovered through yeast two-hybrid screening and further validated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, demonstrating a direct interaction between FAM47E and PRMT5 (Chakrapani2020The). FAM47E enhances the stability of PRMT5 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, thereby increasing PRMT5's association with chromatin and promoting its histone methylation activity (Chakrapani2020The). This interaction influences the expression of PRMT5 target genes and contributes to the oncogenic potential of cells by promoting cell proliferation and clonogenic capacity (Chakrapani2020The).

FAM47E also interacts with MEP50, a protein that forms a complex with PRMT5, although FAM47E does not disrupt the PRMT5-MEP50 interaction (Chakrapani2020The). The interaction between FAM47E and PRMT5 does not result in the methylation of FAM47E, indicating that FAM47E is not a substrate of PRMT5 (Chakrapani2020The). These findings suggest that FAM47E plays a significant role in modulating PRMT5's functions and stability.
