# OSBP

## Overview
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic lipid transfer protein involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and transport within cells. The protein, also named oxysterol-binding protein, is characterized by its ability to bind and transport sterols and phosphoinositides, playing a crucial role at membrane contact sites, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. OSBP is categorized as a lipid transfer protein and is involved in the exchange of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), utilizing the PI4P gradient to facilitate cholesterol transport against its concentration gradient (Nakatsu2021Functions; Mesmin2013A). Additionally, OSBP functions as a sterol sensor and scaffold, influencing various cellular processes, including lipid signaling and metabolism, and regulating the activity of signaling pathways such as the MAPK pathway (WeberBoyvat2013Oxysterolbinding). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as VAP-A, are essential for its role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane identity (Wyles2002Vesicleassociated).

## Structure
The oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is a cytoplasmic protein involved in lipid transport and signaling, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. OSBP contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is responsible for binding to phosphoinositides such as PI(4)P at the Golgi membrane, facilitating membrane tethering (Mesmin2013A). The protein also features a FFAT motif that interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein VAP-A, playing a crucial role in ER-Golgi membrane contact sites (Mesmin2013A). The OSBP-related domain (ORD) is involved in lipid transfer, specifically the exchange of sterols and PI(4)P between membranes (Mesmin2013A).

Structurally, the PH domain of OSBP includes a β-barrel fold, while the ORD is composed of α-helices, which are common in lipid-binding domains (Mesmin2013A). OSBP may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions (Mesmin2013A). The protein is known to have splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles in different cellular contexts (Mesmin2013A). These structural features enable OSBP to effectively mediate lipid transport and signaling at the ER-Golgi interface.

## Function
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is a key player in lipid metabolism and transport within cells, particularly at membrane contact sites (MCSs) such as those between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. OSBP is involved in the exchange of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and cholesterol, utilizing the PI4P gradient to facilitate cholesterol transport against its concentration gradient (Nakatsu2021Functions). This process is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane identity.

OSBP also acts as a sterol sensor, influencing various cellular processes through its role in lipid signaling and metabolism. It regulates the activity of the ERK components of the MAPK signaling pathways by acting as a scaffold for protein phosphatases, which control ERK phosphorylation in a sterol-specific manner (WeberBoyvat2013Oxysterolbinding). Additionally, OSBP is involved in the regulation of ceramide transport to the Golgi for sphingomyelin synthesis, working in conjunction with other lipid transfer proteins like CERT and Nir2 (Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding).

In healthy human cells, OSBP's functions include acting as a lipid sensor and scaffold in cell signaling, regulating lipid transport and composition, and potentially influencing cell proliferation (WeberBoyvat2013Oxysterolbinding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OSBP gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving lipid metabolism and cytoskeletal organization. A mutation in VAP-B, a binding partner of OSBP, is linked to a rare form of motor neuron disease known as ALS8 (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 8) (Ngo2010Functional). Overexpression of OSBP in the liver has been shown to increase triacylglycerol levels, affecting serum lipid profiles and potentially contributing to conditions like atherosclerosis. This is associated with the upregulation of SREBP1-c, a transcriptional activator of lipogenic genes, and other genes involved in lipid metabolism (Fairn2007Emerging).

OSBP-related proteins (ORPs), which share functional similarities with OSBP, are also involved in various diseases. For example, ORP1L's interaction with the microtubule network plays a role in cholesterol sensing and transport, with implications for Niemann-Pick C disease, a lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder (Ngo2010Functional). These findings suggest that dysregulation of OSBP and its related proteins can significantly impact cellular lipid homeostasis and contribute to the development of metabolic disorders and other diseases.

## Interactions
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. OSBP acts as a scaffold for the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A and the tyrosine phosphatase HePTP, forming an oligomeric complex that regulates the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2. This complex is cholesterol-dependent, and its disassembly due to cholesterol depletion or oxysterol addition leads to increased ERK phosphorylation and activation (Wang2005OSBP).

OSBP also interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-A (VAP-A) through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This interaction is crucial for OSBP's localization and function in lipid and sterol homeostasis. Mutations in the PH domain enhance OSBP's association with VAP-A, affecting the export of certain proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (Wyles2002Vesicleassociated).

Additionally, OSBP is involved in lipid transfer between membranes, exchanging cholesterol for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] between the endoplasmic reticulum and the trans-Golgi network. This process is facilitated by OSBP's interaction with VAP-A and is essential for maintaining cholesterol gradients within the cell (Antonny2018The).
