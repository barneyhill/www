# CKMT2

## Overview
CKMT2, or creatine kinase, mitochondrial 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme belonging to the creatine kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism. The protein product of CKMT2, also known as sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase, is primarily involved in the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine and ADP. This enzymatic activity is crucial for energy storage and transfer, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as cardiac and skeletal muscles. CKMT2 is predominantly located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it forms octameric structures that interact with other mitochondrial proteins, such as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), to facilitate efficient energy transfer and maintain mitochondrial integrity (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The gene's expression and function are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, cerebral palsy, and mitochondrial myopathies, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Zheng2024Identification; Lin2024Prognostic).

## Structure
The CKMT2 protein, also known as mitochondrial creatine kinase 2, is characterized by a conserved fold comprising a small all-α N-terminal domain and a larger α + β C-terminal domain, connected by a linker region (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The C-terminal domain includes an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices, contributing to the enzyme's active site (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The primary structure of CKMT2 consists of amino acid sequences that form these structural elements, which are crucial for its function in energy metabolism.

CKMT2 typically assembles into dimers and further into octamers, forming a cuboidal structure with a central channel and exposed C-termini on the top and bottom faces (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). This quaternary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions, which vary between isoforms (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). The octameric form of CKMT2 has a high affinity for cardiolipin, allowing it to bind to mitochondrial membranes and form proteolipid complexes (Schlattner2006Mitochondrial).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and localization. CKMT2 also has known splice variant isoforms that can influence its structural and functional properties. These structural features are essential for CKMT2's role in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.

## Function
CKMT2, or creatine kinase, mitochondrial 2, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular energy homeostasis, particularly in cells with high or fluctuating energy demands such as cardiomyocytes. It catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to creatine, forming phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP. This reaction is essential for storing, buffering, and transporting high-energy phosphates from mitochondria to sites of energy demand (Zervou2017Increasing).

CKMT2 is primarily active in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it functions as an octamer. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology by stabilizing contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. This structural role is crucial for effective phosphotransfer and the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, which is associated with cell death (Zervou2017Increasing).

The enzyme's activity is linked to interactions with adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), facilitating efficient ATP/ADP exchange and supporting mitochondrial integrity. CKMT2's function is vital for maintaining ATP levels during periods of increased energy consumption, thus supporting the high-energy demands of muscle and heart cells (Wallimann2011The; Wallimann1992Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CKMT2 gene, which encodes mitochondrial creatine kinase, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in energy metabolism. In cancer, CKMT2 expression levels vary significantly across different types, influencing prognosis and treatment outcomes. Overexpression of CKMT2 is observed in cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), while it is underexpressed in others like bladder cancer (BLCA) and breast cancer (BRCA) (Lin2024Prognostic). The gene's expression is linked to immune pathways and tumor microenvironment interactions, affecting cancer progression and patient survival (Lin2024Prognostic).

In cerebral palsy (CP), CKMT2 is identified as a potential biomarker, with its impaired activity associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance in neurons. This dysfunction may influence the onset or severity of CP, highlighting CKMT2's role in maintaining energy homeostasis in the brain (Zheng2024Identification). Variations in CKMT2 expression are also linked to mitochondrial myopathies and heart diseases, where disruptions can lead to muscle weakness and cardiac dysfunction due to altered cellular energy homeostasis (Zheng2024Identification).

## Interactions
CKMT2, also known as sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase, is involved in several protein interactions within the mitochondrial environment. It interacts closely with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This interaction is characterized by high affinity and is predominantly electrostatic, involving basic residues on CKMT2 and acidic residues on VDAC. The presence of calcium further strengthens this interaction, and all three VDAC isoforms (Vdac1, Vdac2, Vdac3) are found in complexes with CKMT2 (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

CKMT2 is also associated with adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) within the same complexes, although no direct interaction has been detected. This association is likely mediated by cardiolipin, a phospholipid to which both CKMT2 and ANT have a high affinity (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). These interactions facilitate the efficient transfer of ATP and phosphocreatine, crucial for energy metabolism in tissues with high energy demands (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).

The interactions of CKMT2 with these proteins are essential for its role in cellular energy buffering and transfer, contributing to the stabilization of mitochondrial structure and function (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial). There is no evidence of CKMT2 interacting with nucleic acids (Schlattner2018Mitochondrial).
