# CHRAC1

## Overview
CHRAC1, or chromatin accessibility complex subunit 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the chromatin remodeling process. The protein, also referred to as CHRAC1, is a component of the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF) complex, which plays a pivotal role in modifying chromatin structure to regulate DNA accessibility. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, and DNA repair. CHRAC1 facilitates nucleosome sliding and assembly, contributing to chromatin organization and genomic stability. It interacts with other proteins such as BAZ1A and SMARCA5, enhancing the complex's ability to remodel chromatin and participate in DNA repair mechanisms. The protein's involvement in chromatin dynamics underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity (Aydin2014ISWI; Li2021The).

## Structure


## Function
CHRAC1, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex, plays a significant role in modifying chromatin structure to regulate DNA accessibility, which is crucial for transcription, replication, and DNA repair processes. In healthy human cells, CHRAC1 is involved in facilitating nucleosome sliding and assembly, which is mediated by the BAZ1A-CHRAC complex. This activity is essential for maintaining chromatin organization and ensuring efficient DNA replication and transcription (Aydin2014ISWI; Li2021The).

The ACF complex, which includes CHRAC1, is involved in the relaxation of chromatin structure and the deposition of histones into nucleosome arrays. This complex is crucial for nucleosome sliding during DNA replication and transcription, and it accumulates at DNA double-strand breaks to contribute to nonhomologous end-joining repair by recruiting the KU70/80 complex (Li2021The).

CHRAC1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the dynamic regulation of chromatin architecture, impacting gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. Its role in chromatin remodeling is vital for the proper progression of cellular processes and the maintenance of genomic integrity (Aydin2014ISWI).

## Clinical Significance
CHRAC1 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In lung cancer, CHRAC1 is significantly upregulated, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC), compared to normal lung tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor survival rates in lung cancer patients, suggesting that CHRAC1 could serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis. The gene promotes lung cancer growth by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and tumor formation through its interaction with the transcription co-activator YAP, a key player in the Hippo signaling pathway (Wang2021CHRAC1).

In breast cancer, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CHRAC1 rs10216653 is associated with progression-free survival in patients with negative estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status or higher clinical stage. This SNP is located in active promoter regions and may affect gene expression, potentially contributing to breast cancer susceptibility (Lin2016Allelic).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-coding somatic mutations in the regulatory regions of CHRAC1 have been identified, suggesting a functional role in the disease's development (Sayyab2021Mutational). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CHRAC1 in various cancers.

## Interactions
CHRAC1 is a component of the ACF chromatin remodeling complex, where it interacts with proteins such as BAZ1A, SMARCA1/5, and POLE3. These interactions facilitate nucleosome sliding and assembly, which are crucial for chromatin structure relaxation and histone deposition (Li2021The). BAZ1A, in particular, stimulates the activity of SMARCA5, enhancing the complex's ability to remodel chromatin and participate in DNA double-strand break repair by recruiting the KU70/80 complex (Li2021The).

CHRAC1 has also been identified as a new binder of SUMO2, a small ubiquitin-like modifier, suggesting a potential link between SUMOylation and the DNA damage response (Shu2022Uncover). This interaction was discovered through the use of genetically encoded alkyl bromide non-canonical amino acids to study protein-protein interactions involving SUMO2 and its binding partners (Shu2022Uncover).

Additionally, CHRAC1 interacts with reactive lipid metabolites, such as 15-deoxy-Δ 12,14-prostaglandin J2, which binds to specific cysteine residues in proteins, including C55 of CHRAC1 (Tsukidate2020Targeted). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of CHRAC1 in chromatin remodeling and cellular response mechanisms.
