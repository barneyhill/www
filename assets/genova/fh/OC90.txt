# OC90

## Overview
The OC90 gene encodes the protein otoconin 90, which is predominantly expressed in the inner ear and plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of otoconia, the calcium carbonate crystals essential for balance and spatial orientation. Otoconin 90 is characterized by its structural homology to secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), featuring two domains that facilitate calcium ion binding and contribute to its function as a scaffold for otoconia biomineralization (Wang1998Otoconin90; Zhao2007Gene). The protein's interactions with other matrix components, such as otolin and proteoglycans, are vital for the proper development and stabilization of otoconia (Yang2011Matrix). Mutations or dysregulation of the OC90 gene can lead to balance disorders and have been implicated in certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Pearlman2019Ectopic; Zhao2007Gene).

## Structure
Otoconin 90 (OC90) is a protein characterized by its significant homology to secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), containing two distinct domains that resemble this enzyme. The N-terminal domain of OC90 is similar to type I sPLA2 and includes seven disulfide bonds, while the C-terminal domain contains eight disulfide bonds, a unique arrangement that suggests an ancestral link to type I and II sPLA2s (Wang1998Otoconin90). These disulfide bonds contribute to the protein's rigid structure, which is essential for its function in the extracellular environment (Wang1998Otoconin90).

OC90 is highly acidic, with isoelectric points of 3.9 and 4.9 for its PLA domains, facilitating calcium ion binding, which is crucial for its role in otoconia formation (Wang1998Otoconin90). The protein is heavily glycosylated, with post-translational modifications such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans accounting for a significant portion of its molecular weight (Andrade2012Immunogold). OC90's structure includes two PLA2-like domains, which are thought to contribute to its role as a scaffold for calcium carbonate deposition in otoconia (Zhao2007Gene). The protein's primary structure consists of 453 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 49 kDa (Wang1998Otoconin90).

## Function
Otoconin 90 (OC90) is a critical protein in the formation and maintenance of otoconia, which are calcium carbonate crystals located in the inner ear. These structures are essential for balance and spatial orientation. OC90 is the predominant protein in otoconia, accounting for over 90% of the organic matrix, and plays a vital role in the biomineralization process (Wang1998Otoconin90; Xu2021Functional).

OC90 is involved in the nucleation and growth of otoconial crystals, facilitating the deposition of calcium carbonate by providing a scaffold for crystal formation. It recruits other proteins, such as otolin, to form the organic matrix that controls otoconia growth, morphology, and calcification efficiency (Zhao2007Gene; Andrade2012Immunogold). The protein's structural homology to secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) suggests it may bind calcium ions, which are crucial for the formation of calcitic otoconia (Wang1998Otoconin90).

In the absence of OC90, otoconia formation is severely impaired, leading to balance deficits. This is due to the lack of an organized organic matrix, resulting in abnormal crystal growth and morphology (Zhao2007Gene; Zhao2008Otoconin90). OC90's role in otoconia formation is crucial for maintaining proper vestibular function, as it ensures the correct size and shape of the crystals necessary for detecting gravity and linear head motion (Xu2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the OC90 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly affecting balance and spatial orientation. OC90 is crucial for the formation and organization of otoconia, which are essential for balance in the inner ear. In OC90 null mice, the absence of this gene results in the formation of abnormally large otoconia, which are prone to detachment, potentially leading to conditions similar to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in humans, characterized by dizziness and balance issues (Zhao2007Gene; Andrade2012Immunogold).

In the context of cancer, OC90 expression is notably elevated in certain cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Knockdown of OC90 in TNBC cell lines results in reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer cell survival and metastasis. Conversely, overexpression of OC90 enhances invasiveness, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Pearlman2019Ectopic). OC90 gene amplification is also observed in various cancers, such as prostate cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, and is associated with increased mRNA expression, further implicating its role in cancer progression (Pearlman2019Ectopic).

## Interactions
OC90, or otoconin 90, is a key protein involved in the formation of the otoconial organic matrix in the inner ear. It interacts with several other proteins to facilitate the development and stabilization of otoconia. One of the primary interactions of OC90 is with otolin, a protein that contains a collagen X and C1q domain. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the otoconial matrix, as OC90 recruits otolin to form the organic matrix, which is essential for proper otoconia morphology and growth (Yang2011Matrix; Zhao2007Gene).

OC90 also interacts with proteoglycans, which are important for the structural integrity of the otoconial matrix. The interaction between OC90 and otolin involves both the TH and C1q domains of otolin, which are known for their affinity for proteoglycans and calcium ions (Yang2011Matrix). These interactions are supported by electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding, which are facilitated by the structural features of the proteins involved (Yang2011Matrix).

In addition to its interactions with otolin and proteoglycans, OC90 may also bind to other matrix components such as keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG), although this interaction is weaker and less abundant in otoconia crystals (Yang2011Matrix). These protein-protein interactions are essential for the specific accumulation and stabilization of proteins within the otoconia matrix, highlighting OC90's critical role in otoconia development (Zhao2007Gene).
