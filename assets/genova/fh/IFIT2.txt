# IFIT2

## Overview
The IFIT2 gene encodes the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2, a crucial component of the cellular antiviral response. This protein is part of the interferon-stimulated gene family and is primarily induced by type I and III interferons. It is characterized by the presence of nine tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role in inhibiting viral replication. IFIT2 functions by binding to viral RNA, particularly AU-rich sequences, and interfering with translation initiation, thereby reducing viral protein synthesis. It also plays a role in apoptosis and cellular stress responses, interacting with various proteins, including other IFIT family members and components of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced; Reich2013A). The protein's involvement in modulating immune responses and its association with cancer progression underscore its clinical significance (Zhao2023The; Pidugu2019Emerging).

## Structure
The IFIT2 protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes nine tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs are composed of 34 amino acids each, adopting a helix-turn-helix configuration that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Diamond2012The; Sen2012Crystal). The primary structure of IFIT2 is defined by these TPR motifs, while the secondary structure is characterized by the helix-turn-helix arrangement of the TPRs (Diamond2012The).

The tertiary structure of IFIT2 involves the formation of domain-swapped dimers, where helices are exchanged between monomeric units, creating a strong association at the N terminus (Mears2018Better). This dimerization is a key aspect of its quaternary structure, with the protein predominantly existing as a dimer, although higher-order aggregates can form (Mears2018Better).

IFIT2 also features a positively charged carboxy-terminal region that supports RNA binding, particularly to AU-rich elements in RNA (Diamond2012The; Sen2012Crystal). The protein can bind double-stranded RNA irrespective of the presence of triphosphates at its 5′ end, with a preference for AU-rich sequences (Sen2012Crystal). There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms provided in the context.

## Function
The IFIT2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the cellular response to viral infections. It is part of the interferon-stimulated gene family and is primarily induced by type I and III interferons. IFIT2 is involved in inhibiting viral replication by binding to viral RNA, particularly those with AU-rich sequences, and interfering with translation initiation. This is achieved through its interaction with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), specifically the eIF3e subunit, which disrupts the assembly of the preinitiation complex, thereby reducing overall cellular translation (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced; Terenzi2006Distinct).

In healthy human cells, IFIT2 is located in the cytoplasm and associates with microtubules, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and microtubule dynamics (Zhou2013Interferon). The protein forms a domain-swapped dimer with a positively charged nucleotide-binding channel, allowing it to bind RNA with specificity (Sen2012Crystal). IFIT2 also interacts with various proteins, including other IFIT family members, forming complexes that may contribute to its antiviral functions and regulation of apoptosis (Reich2013A). These interactions highlight its role in modulating the immune response and cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in IFIT2 expression are associated with various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), reduced IFIT2 expression correlates with increased metastasis rates and poorer patient survival. High IFIT2 expression is linked to better outcomes, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Pidugu2019Emerging). In colorectal cancer (CRC), IFIT2 is downregulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributing to the anti-apoptotic properties of cancer cells. This downregulation is associated with larger tumor sizes and increased malignancy (Ohsugi2017Decreased).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high IFIT2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and drug resistance, although it may indicate sensitivity to dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. IFIT2 expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a role in immune response modulation (Zhao2023The).

IFIT2 is also involved in apoptosis and drug resistance. Its overexpression promotes apoptosis in various cancers, while its knockdown enhances drug resistance, particularly in OSCC, by activating atypical PKC signaling (Pidugu2019Emerging). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IFIT2 in cancer progression and treatment.

## Interactions
IFIT2, also known as ISG54, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its function in antiviral defense and apoptosis. IFIT2 forms complexes with other IFIT family members, such as IFIT1 and IFIT3, but not with IFIT5, facilitating its role in antiviral activities (Reich2013A; Pidugu2019Emerging). These interactions are mediated by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which enable protein-protein interactions (Pidugu2019Emerging).

IFIT2 can bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), showing a preference for AU-rich sequences, and can interact with viral RNA containing a 5' triphosphate group (Sen2012Crystal; Pidugu2019Emerging). It also interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), specifically the eIF3c and eIF3e subunits, inhibiting translation initiation and thus slowing down viral replication (Fensterl2015InterferonInduced; Ohsugi2017Decreased).

In the context of apoptosis, IFIT2 interacts with the Bcl-2 family of proteins, influencing mitochondrial membrane permeability and promoting apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (Reich2013A; Pidugu2019Emerging). It also associates with MITA (mediator of IRF3 activation), which is involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death (Ohsugi2017Decreased).
