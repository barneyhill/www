# MED28

## Overview
MED28 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 28, which is a component of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein complex essential for transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. The protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of smooth muscle cell differentiation and cytoskeletal organization. MED28 interacts with several proteins, such as β-catenin and ZNF224, influencing pathways related to cancer progression and transcriptional repression. The gene's expression is tightly regulated and its dysregulation has been implicated in the development and progression of various cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers. MED28's role in cancer biology is further underscored by its interactions with key signaling pathways and its impact on genomic stability and cell cycle regulation (Cho2019MED28; Cho2017MED28; Yoon2010Elevated).

## Structure
MED28 is a component of the mammalian Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. Structurally, MED28 is part of the Tail module of the Mediator complex, where it forms a double bracket-like structure with other subunits such as MED27, MED29, and MED30. The N-terminal coiled coils of MED28 interdigitate with those of MED27 and MED29 to form a 6-helix bundle, while the C-terminal helices of MED28 contribute to a 4-helix bundle with MED11 and MED22, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Zhao2021Structure).

MED28 contains a proline-rich region and a MED domain, which are important for its interactions with other proteins, such as ZNF224 in the context of DNA damage response (Cho2017MED28). Post-translational modifications, including acetylation, have been observed in the nematode orthologue MDT-28, suggesting similar modifications may occur in MED28, affecting its localization and function (Kostrouchová2018Valproic).

MED28 also plays a role in smooth muscle cell differentiation, where its expression levels can influence gene expression related to this process (Napoli2012Unraveling). The protein's structure and interactions within the Mediator complex contribute to its regulatory functions in transcription and cellular processes.

## Function
MED28, a subunit of the Mediator complex, plays a significant role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. It is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle gene expression. Knockdown of MED28 in NIH3T3 and myoblast C2C12 cells results in the upregulation of smooth muscle genes, while its overexpression represses these genes. This suggests that MED28 may regulate smooth muscle gene expression through a cytoplasmic monomer isoform, rather than as a component of the Mediator complex (Yin2014The).

MED28 is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is crucial for maintaining the overall structure of the complex. The head module impacts transcription by shifting the transcription machinery from active to inactive states (Youn2016Regulation). MED28 has also been associated with transcriptionally repressed Mediator complexes, which are characterized by a lower association with RNA polymerase II compared to other complexes (Paoletti2006Quantitative).

In addition to its role in transcription, MED28 interacts with the cytoskeletal protein merlin, localizing beneath the plasma membrane and interacting with the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a potential role in cytoskeletal organization (Yin2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MED28 gene have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of MED28 is associated with cancer cell proliferation and genomic instability, contributing to tumorigenesis. This overexpression is linked to several cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of disease-related death in breast cancer patients (Cho2019MED28; Yoon2010Elevated). In breast cancer, elevated MED28 expression is a strong independent prognostic indicator of survival, correlating with higher tumor grade, lymph node metastases, and estrogen receptor negativity (Yoon2010Elevated).

MED28 overexpression also shortens the cell cycle and increases chromosomal instability, leading to aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer (Cho2019MED28). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as E2F-1, NRF-1, ETS-1, and C/EBPβ, which are associated with various cancers (Cho2019MED28). Additionally, MED28 interacts with ZNF224, stabilizing it during DNA damage and potentially contributing to cancer cell survival and proliferation (Cho2017MED28). In non-small cell lung cancer, MED28 expression is influenced by the long non-coding RNA FOXD3-AS1, which promotes cancer progression through the miR-127-3p/MED28 axis (zeng2020highly).

## Interactions
MED28, a subunit of the mediator complex, engages in various protein interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression. In colorectal cancer cells, MED28 interacts with β-catenin, stabilizing the transactivation of Wnt target genes, which is crucial for maintaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Lee2015AllTransRetinoic). MED28 also interacts with HBP1, a transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, both targets of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Lee2015AllTransRetinoic).

In oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, MED28 is associated with cancer stem cell-like properties and interacts with RCOR1, a protein involved in stem cell differentiation. RCOR1 directly binds to MED28, weakening its effect on the expression of cancer stem cell markers such as CD44, KLF4, NANOG, and OCT4 (Xiang2020RCOR1).

In breast cancer cells, MED28 interacts with ZNF224, a zinc-finger protein that regulates the transcription of TP53 and p21. This interaction occurs in the nucleus and stabilizes ZNF224, preventing its degradation upon DNA damage, which may enhance the colony-forming ability of cancer cells (Cho2017MED28). These interactions highlight MED28's multifaceted role in cancer biology through its involvement in various signaling pathways and protein complexes.
