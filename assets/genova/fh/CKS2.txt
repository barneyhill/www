# CKS2

## Overview
CKS2, or CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to cell cycle regulation and neurodevelopment. The CKS2 protein functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) subunit, primarily interacting with cyclin A/CDK2 complexes to modulate their activity, which is crucial for the transitions between the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Frontini2012The). Beyond its role in cell cycle progression, CKS2 is involved in stabilizing the CDK inhibitor p27, thereby preventing its degradation and ensuring proper cell cycle control (Frontini2012The). Additionally, CKS2 plays a significant role in neurodevelopment by influencing neuronal differentiation, which is essential for brain development (Frontini2012The). The protein's interactions extend to mitochondrial functions, where it forms complexes with mitochondrial proteins, contributing to mitochondrial DNA replication and oxidative phosphorylation (Jonsson2019Mitochondrial). CKS2's dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Kang2008Upregulation; Qiu2023Identification).

## Function
The CKS2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in maintaining replicative fidelity and neurodevelopment. CKS2 functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) subunit, interacting with cyclin A/CDK2 complexes to modulate their activity. This interaction is essential for proper cell cycle progression, especially during the G1/S and G2/M transitions (Frontini2012The).

In healthy cells, CKS2 stabilizes the CDK inhibitor p27 by competing with CKS1 for binding to phosphorylated p27, thereby preventing its degradation. This balance is critical for controlling cyclin A/CDK2 activity, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and preventing DNA damage (Frontini2012The). The absence of CKS2 leads to increased cyclin A/CDK2 activity, resulting in replication stress and DNA damage due to accelerated replication fork velocity (Frontini2012The).

CKS2 is also involved in neurodevelopment, where it influences neuronal differentiation by regulating p27 levels. In the developing brain, CKS2 expression promotes the differentiation of cortical progenitor cells into mature neurons, a process crucial for proper cortical lamination and brain development (Frontini2012The).

## Clinical Significance
CKS2 (CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 2) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of CKS2 is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness in several cancers, including gastric cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

In gastric cancer, CKS2 is upregulated, leading to increased cell proliferation and downregulation of tumor suppressors such as p53 and p21 cip1. This upregulation is linked to tumor differentiation, size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced pTNM stage, suggesting its potential as a prognostic factor (Kang2008Upregulation).

In OSCC, high CKS2 expression correlates with poor overall survival and progression-free survival. It promotes cell proliferation and is associated with immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden, indicating its role in creating an immune-tolerant microenvironment (Qiu2023Identification).

In HCC, CKS2 overexpression is linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor differentiation. It is negatively associated with p27 kip1 protein levels, a tumor suppressor, suggesting a mechanism for tumor progression (Shen2010Clinical).

In PTC, CKS2 is a downstream target of miR-26a, and its overexpression enhances cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis, contributing to tumorigenesis (Lv2013miR26a).

## Interactions
CKS2 (CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and mitochondrial function. CKS2 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK1, forming complexes that are essential for cell cycle progression. These interactions occur in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with CKS2-CDK1 complexes observed in HeLa cells (Jonsson2019Mitochondrial). CKS2 also forms complexes with the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSBP1) in the mitochondria, which is significant for mitochondrial DNA replication and oxidative phosphorylation (Radulovic2010CKS; Jonsson2019Mitochondrial).

The interaction between CKS2 and SSBP1 is regulated throughout the cell cycle, with a high abundance in the G1 phase and a decrease during the S-phase, coinciding with peaks of mitochondrial DNA replication (Jonsson2019Mitochondrial). Under hypoxic conditions, the abundance of CKS2-SSBP1 complexes is significantly reduced, indicating a role in mitochondrial DNA replication (Jonsson2019Mitochondrial). CKS2 also associates with chromatin and transcriptional machinery, binding to the promoters and open reading frames of genes such as CCNB1 and CDK1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation (MartinssonAhlzén2008CyclinDependent).
