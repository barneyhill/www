# GNE

## Overview
The GNE gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme known as glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of sialic acid, a crucial component of glycoproteins and glycolipids in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is categorized as both an epimerase and a kinase, reflecting its dual functional domains that facilitate the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and the subsequent phosphorylation of ManNAc to ManNAc 6-phosphate. These reactions are essential for the production of CMP-sialic acid, the active form of sialic acid, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, immunoregulation, and signal transduction (Harazi2016The; Milman2011GNE). The GNE protein's activity is tightly regulated by feedback inhibition from CMP-sialic acid, ensuring homeostasis in sialic acid levels (Milman2011GNE). Mutations in the GNE gene are linked to several clinical conditions, including GNE myopathy and sialuria, highlighting its significance in muscle function and metabolic regulation (Mullen2022GNE; Celeste2014Mutation).

## Structure
The GNE protein, encoded by the GNE gene, is a bifunctional enzyme involved in sialic acid biosynthesis, consisting of two main domains: the N-terminal UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase domain and the C-terminal ManNAc kinase domain (Ghaderi2007Evidence; Yardeni2011Identification). The primary structure of GNE includes 722 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 79 kDa (Ghaderi2007Evidence; BLUME2004Domainspecific).

The secondary structure of the N-terminal epimerase domain features a 7-stranded parallel β-sheet sandwiched between 7 α-helices, while the C-terminal kinase domain contains a 6-stranded β-sheet surrounded by 7 α-helices (Yardeni2011Identification). The tertiary structure of the epimerase domain is characterized by two α/β domains forming a cleft that harbors the active site, with a topology similar to the Rossmann dinucleotide binding fold (Yardeni2011Identification).

In terms of quaternary structure, GNE can form various oligomeric states, including monomers, dimers, tetramers, and hexamers. The tetrameric form is considered the active state in cells, stabilized by ligands such as UDP-GlcNAc (Ghaderi2007Evidence). The kinase domain predominantly exists as a dimer in solution, with potential for higher-order oligomerization (Tong2009Crystal). The GNE protein also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may affect its enzymatic activity and regulation (Yardeni2011Identification).

## Function
The GNE gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, which is crucial in the biosynthesis of sialic acid, a key component of glycoproteins and glycolipids in eukaryotic cells (Harazi2016The; Milman2011GNE). This enzyme catalyzes two sequential steps: the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and the phosphorylation of ManNAc to ManNAc 6-phosphate, which are essential for the synthesis of CMP-sialic acid, the active form of sialic acid (Milman2011GNE). Sialic acids are involved in cellular recognition processes, including cell adhesion, immunoregulation, and signal transduction, which are vital for various biological functions (Kemmner2011Loss).

In healthy human cells, GNE is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cellular communication and immune response (Harazi2016The). It is also involved in the early development of skeletal and cardiac muscle, influencing the proliferation, adherence, and differentiation of muscle cells (Milman2011GNE). The enzyme's activity is regulated by feedback inhibition from CMP-sialic acid, ensuring balanced sialic acid production (Milman2011GNE). GNE's role extends beyond sialic acid biosynthesis, potentially influencing muscle development and function (Milman2011GNE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNE gene are primarily associated with GNE myopathy, a rare autosomal recessive degenerative muscle disorder. This condition is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, often beginning with foot drop and advancing to significant disability over 10-20 years. Muscle wasting is particularly evident in distal and proximal skeletal muscles, and in advanced stages, it can affect the quadriceps and neck muscles. Respiratory muscle weakness and dilated cardiomyopathy may also occur in severe cases. Histopathological features include rimmed vacuoles and filamentous inclusions in muscle biopsies, with decreased sialylation observed in affected muscles (Nishino2014GNE; Mullen2022GNE; Celeste2014Mutation).

GNE myopathy is caused by biallelic, predominantly missense mutations in the GNE gene, leading to reduced enzymatic activities and impaired sialylation (Celeste2014Mutation). The disease is known by various names, including Nonaka distal myopathy and hereditary inclusion body myositis (Mullen2022GNE). Another condition linked to GNE mutations is sialuria, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coarse facies, developmental delay, hepatomegaly, and recurrent infections. Sialuria results from heterozygous missense mutations affecting the allosteric site of GNE, causing loss of feedback inhibition and excessive sialic acid production (Celeste2014Mutation).

## Interactions
The GNE protein, encoded by the GNE gene, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular functions. One significant interaction is with alpha-actinin 1, an actin-binding protein involved in linking the cytoskeleton to transmembrane proteins and participating in signaling pathways. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunohistochemistry, showing that GNE and alpha-actinin 1 are expressed in overlapping compartments in skeletal muscle. The presence of calcium enhances the binding affinity between GNE and alpha-actinin 1, although the interaction is not strictly calcium-dependent (Amsili2008UDPNAcetylglucosamine).

GNE also interacts with alpha-actinin 2, with a higher affinity compared to alpha-actinin 1. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of GNE myopathy, where the M743T mutation in GNE results in a significantly reduced binding affinity to alpha-actinin 2. The interaction occurs at the C-terminus of alpha-actinin 2 and is crucial for understanding the muscle pathology associated with GNE myopathy (Harazi2016The).

Additionally, the V727M mutation in GNE may affect its interaction with the MYC protein, potentially influencing transcriptional regulation of genes involved in muscle contraction and metabolism (Attri2021Dissecting).
