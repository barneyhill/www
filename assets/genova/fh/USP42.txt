# USP42

## Overview
USP42 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 42, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability and DNA repair mechanisms. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP42 plays a critical role in modulating the ubiquitination status of target proteins, thereby influencing their degradation, localization, and activity. The protein is particularly noted for its role in stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53 during stress responses, facilitating cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair (Hock2011Regulation). Additionally, USP42 is implicated in homologous recombination repair by promoting DNA-end resection and recruiting BRCA1 to double-strand break sites, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability (Matsui2020USP42). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021USP42; Teixeira2024Investigating).

## Structure
USP42 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region, which is crucial for its phase separation properties and subcellular localization. This region is rich in proline, arginine, and lysine residues, contributing to its ability to form nuclear speckle-like structures through liquid-liquid phase separation (Liu2021USP42). The C-terminal sequence, spanning amino acids 946–1316, is sufficient for nuclear and nuclear speckle localization, with the 946–1156 region being particularly important for proper localization (Matsui2020USP42).

USP42's structure includes domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as PLRG1, which it recruits into nuclear speckles. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region, independent of its enzymatic activity (Liu2021USP42). The protein's enzymatic activity, however, is necessary for effective incorporation into nuclear speckles, as demonstrated by a catalytically inactive mutant that fails to colocalize with SC35, a nuclear speckle marker (Liu2021USP42).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, play a role in regulating USP42's function and its involvement in nuclear speckle dynamics, impacting processes like mRNA splicing and cell growth (Uriarte2021USP42).

## Function
USP42 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 42) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and function of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In healthy human cells, USP42 stabilizes p53 by removing ubiquitin chains, particularly during the early phase of a stress response. This stabilization facilitates rapid p53 induction, leading to cell-cycle arrest, which allows cells to repair and survive mild or transient damage (Hock2011Regulation). USP42 does not affect basal p53 levels in unstressed cells, indicating its specific role during stress conditions (Hock2011Regulation).

USP42 is also involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair, a critical DNA repair process. It enhances HR by promoting DNA-end resection, a necessary step for HR to occur, and facilitates the recruitment of BRCA1 to double-strand break sites. This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and efficient DNA repair (Matsui2020USP42). USP42's activity in HR is linked to its interaction with the DNA-RNA helicase DHX9, which aids in resolving R-loops, structures that can impede transcription and genome stability if not properly managed (Matsui2020USP42).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USP42 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small-cell lung cancer, USP42 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting tumorigenesis through its role in mRNA splicing and interaction with spliceosome components like PLRG1 (Liu2021USP42). In familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), a germline mutation in USP42, specifically p.(Gly486Arg), has been identified. This mutation is associated with overexpression of USP42, p53, and cleaved Caspase-3 in tumor samples, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Teixeira2024Investigating).

USP42 is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through the formation of a chimeric gene with RUNX1, resulting from an insertion mechanism. This fusion gene is associated with higher USP42 expression in AML cases, potentially contributing to leukemogenesis (Masetti2014Whole; Zagaria20145‘RUNX13’USP42). Additionally, USP42's role in deubiquitinating histones and regulating transcriptional activity, particularly affecting p53 target genes, underscores its potential impact on cancer progression (Hock2014Ubiquitinspecific). These findings suggest that USP42 may act as an oncogene in certain contexts, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
USP42 interacts with several proteins and plays a role in various cellular processes. It forms a direct complex with the tumor suppressor protein p53, deubiquitinating and stabilizing it, particularly during the early phases of stress response. This interaction is crucial for the rapid activation of p53-dependent transcription and cell-cycle arrest (Hock2011Regulation). USP42 also interacts with PLRG1, a spliceosome component, facilitating its integration into nuclear speckles. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of USP42 and does not require its enzymatic activity (Liu2021USP42).

USP42 is involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair by interacting with the DNA-RNA helicase DHX9. This interaction is essential for resolving DNA double-strand break (DSB)-induced R-loops and recruiting BRCA1 to DSB sites, promoting DNA-end resection (Matsui2019A; Matsui2020USP42). The localization of USP42 to nuclear speckles, which is crucial for its function in HR, is mediated by an intrinsically disordered region of the protein (Matsui2020USP42). These interactions highlight USP42's role in regulating protein stability and function through its deubiquitinating activity and participation in multiprotein complexes.
