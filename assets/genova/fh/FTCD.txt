# FTCD

## Overview
The FTCD gene encodes the enzyme formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase, a bifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in the catabolism of histidine and the folate metabolism cycle. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and is involved in the final steps of L-histidine degradation, facilitating the transfer of formimino groups and the removal of ammonia, which are essential processes in the folate cycle. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal folate metabolism, and deficiencies can lead to metabolic disorders. Structurally, FTCD is characterized by its octameric assembly, which is vital for its enzymatic function and its ability to interact with cellular structures such as vimentin filaments. This interaction highlights FTCD's role beyond enzymatic activity, contributing to the structural organization within cells. Mutations in the FTCD gene can result in clinical conditions such as glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency and have been linked to variations in arsenic metabolism and toxicity (Hilton2003The; Zhang2021Formimidoyltransferase; Pierce2019A; Gao2002A).

## Structure
FTCD (formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase) is a bifunctional enzyme involved in histidine catabolism and folate metabolism. The primary structure of FTCD consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the FTCD gene. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its enzymatic function. The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape, which is typical for enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. FTCD's quaternary structure is characterized by an octameric assembly, which is crucial for its ability to bind to cellular structures like the Golgi complex and promote the bundling of vimentin filaments, indicating its structural roles beyond enzymatic activity (Zhang2021Formimidoyltransferase).

FTCD contains specific domains for its enzymatic activities, including the FT domain, which is involved in the transfer of one-carbon units. A mutation in the FT domain's C-subdomain, specifically at the eighth β-motif, has been identified, highlighting the importance of this region in maintaining enzyme function (Zhang2021Formimidoyltransferase). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of FTCD can result in structural and functional diversity, allowing the enzyme to participate in various cellular processes.

## Function
The FTCD gene encodes the enzyme formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase, which is crucial for the catabolism of histidine and the folate metabolism cycle in healthy human cells. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it catalyzes the final two reactions in the L-histidine degradation pathway. The formiminotransferase domain of FTCD transfers a formimino group from N-formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), producing formimino-THF and freeing glutamate. The cyclodeaminase domain then removes ammonia from formimino-THF, generating 5,10-methenylTHF, which can be further converted to 5,10-methyleneTHF or THF, both integral to the folate cycle (Pierce2019A; Hilton2003The).

FTCD's role in the folate cycle is essential for providing one-carbon groups to the methionine cycle, which supplies these groups to methyltransferases involved in methylation processes, including arsenic methylation (Pierce2019A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal folate metabolism, and deficiencies can lead to disorders such as glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency, characterized by elevated levels of formiminoglutamate in the urine (Hilton2003The). FTCD is also involved in the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which provides methyl groups for methyltransferase reactions (Pierce2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FTCD gene can lead to glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder and the second most common inborn error of folate metabolism. This condition presents in two phenotypes: a severe form characterized by elevated levels of formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) in the urine after histidine administration, megaloblastic anemia, and mental retardation, and a mild form with high urinary excretion of FIGLU without histidine administration, mild developmental delay, and no hematological abnormalities (Hilton2003The). Specific mutations such as c.457C>T (R135C), c.940G>C (R299P), and c.1033insG have been identified, with the latter causing a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon (Hilton2003The).

In addition to its role in folate metabolism, the FTCD gene is associated with arsenic metabolism and toxicity phenotypes. A missense variant, rs61735836, has been linked to arsenic metabolism efficiency and the risk of arsenic-induced skin lesions. This variant affects the percentages of arsenic species in urine, suggesting an impact on arsenic metabolism efficiency and toxicity risk (Pierce2019A). The variant is associated with increased risk of skin lesions, a common sign of arsenic toxicity (Pierce2019A).

## Interactions
FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) is known to interact with vimentin intermediate filaments, playing a significant role in their bundling. This interaction is independent of FTCD's enzymatic activity and relies on its structural properties. FTCD acts as a molecular 'glue' by crosslinking vimentin filaments, facilitating the bundling of individual filaments into thicker fibers. This bundling is specific to FTCD, as demonstrated by in vitro experiments where other proteins like BSA did not affect vimentin filament morphology (Gao2002A).

The octameric structure of FTCD is crucial for its interaction with vimentin. FTCD monomers form dimers, which then assemble into a planar octamer necessary for binding and bundling vimentin filaments. When FTCD is divided into its FT and CD domains, these fragments fail to assemble into the octameric structure and do not bind or bundle vimentin filaments, indicating the importance of the full oligomeric structure for its function (Gao2002A).

FTCD's interaction with vimentin is also observed in vivo, particularly in the peri-Golgi region, where it co-localizes with the Golgi marker GM130. Overexpression of FTCD in cells leads to the formation of thick FTCD/vimentin filament bundles, further supporting its role in modulating the vimentin cytoskeleton (Gao2002A).
