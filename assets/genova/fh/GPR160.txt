# GPR160

## Overview
GPR160 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 160, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its role in transmembrane signaling. This receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways that influence cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. GPR160 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, notably prostate cancer, where it is overexpressed and associated with tumor growth and progression. The receptor's interaction with specific peptides and its involvement in signaling pathways such as ERK phosphorylation highlight its potential as a therapeutic target. Research into GPR160's function and interactions continues to uncover its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Yosten2020GPR160; Li2022Therapeutic; Zhou2016G).

## Clinical Significance
GPR160 is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer pathogenesis. Knockdown of GPR160 in prostate cancer cells leads to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, indicating its potential role in tumor growth and progression (Zhou2016G). The gene is associated with cytokine and cytokine receptor interactions, which may be significant in understanding its role in cancer (Zhou2016G). In vivo experiments have shown that silencing GPR160 impairs tumor growth in mice, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2016G).

GPR160 is also involved in cancer-related biological processes such as DNA repair and transcriptional misregulation (Li2022Therapeutic). Computational studies have identified FDA-approved drugs, such as Cinacalcet and Irinotecan, with strong binding affinities to GPR160, suggesting potential repurposing for prostate cancer treatment (Li2022Therapeutic). Despite its overexpression, the clinical significance of GPR160 mutations and their direct association with specific clinical outcomes or diseases require further investigation (Li2022Therapeutic). The gene's dysregulation at mRNA and protein levels in prostate cancer underscores its potential as a drug target, although the findings are based on computational methods and need further validation (Li2022Therapeutic).

## Interactions
GPR160, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, has been shown to interact with various proteins, influencing cellular processes. In the context of neuropathic pain, GPR160 interacts with the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp). This interaction is evidenced by CARTp's ability to stimulate cFOS and ERK phosphorylation in human KATO III cells and PC-12 cells, effects that are diminished when GPR160 is silenced using siRNA. The physical interaction between CARTp and GPR160 is further supported by coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, indicating a specific and functional relationship (Yosten2020GPR160).

In prostate cancer, GPR160 is implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Knockdown of GPR160 in prostate cancer cells leads to increased expression of CASP1 and IL6, suggesting that GPR160 may interact with pathways involving these proteins. The study also notes changes in the expression of cell cycle-related genes such as CCNB1, CCNB2, and CDC25C, although specific physical interactions with these proteins are not detailed (Zhou2016G).

GPR160's role in the entry of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into macrophages involves the ERK signaling pathway, where GPR160 is suggested to regulate ERK phosphorylation, although direct physical interactions with ERK are not explicitly described (Yang2016G).
