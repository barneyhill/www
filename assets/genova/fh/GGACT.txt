# GGACT

## Overview
The GGACT gene encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamylamine cyclotransferase, which is involved in the metabolism of gamma-glutamyl compounds. This enzyme is categorized as a cyclotransferase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of gamma-glutamylamines into free amines and 5-oxoproline. Gamma-glutamylamine cyclotransferase plays a crucial role in the catabolism of protein cross-links, particularly those involving transglutaminase-mediated bonds, which are important for maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues. The activity of this enzyme is significant in processes such as protein turnover and cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
