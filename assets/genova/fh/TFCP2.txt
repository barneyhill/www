# TFCP2

## Overview
TFCP2 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor CP2, a member of the TFCP2/Grainyhead family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its N-terminal DNA-binding domain and C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which are essential for its role in transcription regulation and protein dimerization, respectively (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). Transcription factor CP2 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a critical role in various biological processes, including cell cycle control, immune response regulation, and hematopoiesis (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). It is involved in both transcriptional and non-transcriptional cellular functions, interacting with multiple proteins to influence cancer progression and other cellular processes (Yunes2022Factor). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in several cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogenic factor, depending on the context (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1; Zhao2020A).

## Structure
The TFCP2 protein is part of the TFCP2/Grainyhead family of transcription factors and is characterized by a specific domain structure. It contains a N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for its role in transcription regulation, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain that facilitates protein dimerization (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). The DNA-binding domain allows TFCP2 to interact with specific DNA sequences, while the SAM domain is involved in forming dimers, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor.

TFCP2 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle control and regulation of immune-related genes (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. TFCP2 also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Zhao2020A).

In the context of cancer, TFCP2 can act as both a tumor suppressor and a pro-oncogenic factor, depending on the cellular environment (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). Its involvement in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, highlights its significance in oncogenic processes (Zhao2020A).

## Function
TFCP2, also known as transcription factor CP2, is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, influencing the transcription of genes essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). TFCP2 is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates entry into the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, promotes DNA synthesis, and functions as an antiapoptotic factor (Zhao2020A).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, TFCP2 is involved in the regulation of immune-related and cytochrome P450 genes, contributing to hematopoiesis and cell cycle control (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). It also participates in the regulation of various cellular and viral promoters, including the murine α-globin promoter, highlighting its diverse regulatory capabilities (Zhao2020A).

TFCP2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development. Its activity in the nucleus and its ability to regulate a wide range of genes make it a crucial component of cellular function in healthy human cells (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1).

## Clinical Significance
The TFCP2 gene is implicated in various cancers, often exhibiting altered expression levels that contribute to disease progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TFCP2 is significantly overexpressed in over 90% of cases, correlating with disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy drugs like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). It is involved in dysregulated Notch signaling and promotes metastasis by upregulating genes such as SPP1, FN1, and TJP1 (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). In breast cancer, TFCP2 is upregulated in aggressive basal subtypes and is associated with poor survival, enhancing EGFR signaling and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Zhao2020A).

TFCP2 fusions, such as FUS-TFCP2 and EWSR1-TFCP2, are characteristic of certain sarcomas, including epithelioid and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcomas. These fusions interfere with myogenic differentiation and are associated with poor clinical outcomes (Le2020A; Schöpf2024Multiomic). In these sarcomas, TFCP2 rearrangements are linked to ALK upregulation and may respond to targeted therapies like ALK inhibitors (Schöpf2024Multiomic).

Conversely, TFCP2 may act as a tumor suppressor in melanoma by regulating DAPK transcription, highlighting its complex role in cancer biology (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1).

## Interactions
TFCP2, also known as transcription factor CP2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression and cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TFCP2 interacts with proteins such as GRP78, Notch1, and H-Ras, affecting the expression of genes like osteopontin (OPN), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), thymidylate synthase (TS), and fibronectin 1 (FN1) (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1). TFCP2 also forms complexes with β-catenin in pancreatic cancer, activating TCF signaling pathways (Kotarba2018TFCP2TFCP2L1UBP1).

In breast cancer, TFCP2 is part of a feedback loop with the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling axis, regulating the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) (Zhao2020A). This interaction promotes EGFR activation, which is crucial for metastatic activity (Zhao2020A).

TFCP2 also plays a role in mitosis, interacting with proteins involved in spindle formation and stability. It binds to α-tubulin and influences microtubule dynamics, with Factor quinolinone inhibitors (FQIs) like FQI1 disrupting these interactions, leading to mitotic defects (Yunes2022Factor). These interactions highlight TFCP2's involvement in both transcriptional regulation and non-transcriptional roles in cellular processes.
