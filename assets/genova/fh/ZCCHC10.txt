# ZCCHC10

## Overview
ZCCHC10 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 10 protein, which is characterized by its CCHC-type zinc finger domain. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as telomerase activity regulation, p53 stability, and tumor suppression. The zinc finger CCHC-type containing 10 protein interacts with various cellular proteins, including PITX1 and p53, to modulate pathways associated with cellular senescence, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Its function is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, with implications in several cancers, including lung and colorectal cancer, where its expression and interactions are altered (Ma2021MiR4103p; Ning2019ZCCHC10; Ohira2019PITX1).

## Function
ZCCHC10 is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating hTERT mRNA transcription, which is crucial for telomerase activity and cellular proliferation. It interacts with the PITX1 protein, forming a complex that binds directly to specific regions in the hTERT promoter, leading to the suppression of hTERT transcription. This interaction is essential for the negative regulation of telomerase activity, contributing to cellular senescence and apoptosis (Ohira2019PITX1).

ZCCHC10 is also involved in maintaining p53 stability by inhibiting its interaction with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase responsible for p53 degradation. This function is crucial for p53's role as a tumor suppressor, suggesting that ZCCHC10 may help regulate cell proliferation and prevent tumorigenesis (Zhou2023Epigenetic; AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide).

In healthy human cells, ZCCHC10's role in these processes indicates its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell growth. Its activity is primarily associated with transcriptional regulation and protein interactions that influence key cellular pathways related to aging and cancer (Ohira2019PITX1; Wang2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The ZCCHC10 gene has been implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZCCHC10 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is downregulated by the long non-coding RNA SNHG1, which promotes methylation of the ZCCHC10 promoter, leading to decreased p53 activation. This downregulation is associated with increased AML cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to the BCL inhibitor venetoclax, contributing to disease progression (Zhou2023Epigenetic).

In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, ZCCHC10 is downregulated, which correlates with poor prognosis. It stabilizes the p53 protein by inhibiting its degradation, thereby suppressing cancer progression and resistance to cisplatin chemotherapy. The gene's expression is crucial for maintaining p53 activity, and its downregulation is linked to increased cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Ning2019ZCCHC10).

In colorectal cancer, ZCCHC10 is targeted by miR-410-3p, leading to its downregulation and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, highlighting ZCCHC10's role as a tumor suppressor in this context (Ma2021MiR4103p).

## Interactions
ZCCHC10 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with the p53 protein, a crucial transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. ZCCHC10 enhances the stability and function of p53 by reducing its ubiquitination and degradation, mediated by the MDM2 protein. This interaction is facilitated by the CCHC-type zinc finger domain of ZCCHC10, which disrupts the interaction between MDM2 and p53, thereby promoting p53's tumor-suppressive functions in lung cancer cells (Ning2019ZCCHC10).

ZCCHC10 also interacts with the PITX1 protein, a transcription factor involved in regulating hTERT mRNA transcription. The interaction between ZCCHC10 and PITX1 is crucial for the suppression of hTERT transcription, which is often upregulated in cancer cells. This interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of PITX1 and the CCHC domain of ZCCHC10, and it plays a role in cellular senescence and apoptosis (Ohira2019PITX1).

In colorectal cancer, ZCCHC10 is targeted by miR-410-3p, which negatively regulates its expression. This interaction influences the NF-κB signaling pathway, affecting cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Ma2021MiR4103p).
