# WWP1

## Overview
WWP1 is a gene that encodes the WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, a member of the NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its C2-WW-HECT domain structure, which facilitates its role in the ubiquitination process, a critical mechanism for regulating protein stability, localization, and activity within cells (Kuang2021WW). The WWP1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways such as the Hedgehog and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathways, and plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Komuro2004Negative; Behera2023WWP1). WWP1's interactions with other proteins, including tumor suppressors and viral proteins, underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, such as cancer and viral infections (Behera2023WWP1; Yeung2013WWP1). The gene's clinical relevance is highlighted by its involvement in oncogenesis, bone diseases, and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Behera2023WWP1; Chen2007The).

## Structure
The WWP1 protein is a member of the C2-WW-HECT E3 ligase family and is characterized by its complex domain structure. The predominant isoform of WWP1 consists of 922 amino acids and includes an N-terminal Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding (C2) domain, four WW domains (WW1-4), and a homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain (Kuang2021WW). The C2 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and membrane targeting. Each WW domain contains 35-40 residues in a triple strand β-sheet structure, characterized by two tryptophan residues spaced 20-22 residues apart, and mediates interactions with substrates or adaptors, especially those with PY motifs (Kuang2021WW).

The HECT domain, located at the C-terminus, provides E3 ligase activity and is divided into two lobes: the N-lobe binds to an E2 enzyme, while the C-lobe is involved in ubiquitination. A critical cysteine residue (C890) in the C-lobe forms a covalent bond with ubiquitin (Kuang2021WW). The WW4 domain adopts an antiparallel three-stranded β-sheet fold with a unique short C-terminal 3_10 helix, and specific residues in this domain are critical for ligand binding (Qin2008Identification).

WWP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which modulate its stability and activity (Kuang2021WW). The protein can also exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (Kuang2021WW).

## Function
WWP1, a member of the NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which regulates protein stability, localization, and activity in healthy human cells. It is involved in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions (Behera2023WWP1). WWP1 is expressed in almost all human tissues and is localized in various subcellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, endosome, and nucleus (Behera2023WWP1).

WWP1 regulates several biological processes, such as ciliary dynamics, bone health, and cell density. It ubiquitinates Ptch1 and recruits Smo, which is essential for the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and regulates osteoblast function by promoting the degradation of RUNX2, a transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation (Behera2023WWP1). In the central nervous system, WWP1 maintains neuromuscular junction integrity through interactions with Nogo-A (Behera2023WWP1).

WWP1 also plays a role in the negative regulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling by interacting with Smad7, leading to the downregulation of TGF-β receptor function (Komuro2004Negative). This regulation is crucial for controlling cell growth and differentiation (Komuro2004Negative).

## Clinical Significance
The WWP1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In cancer, WWP1 acts as an oncogene in several types, including breast, prostate, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is frequently amplified and overexpressed, promoting tumor growth and progression by degrading tumor suppressors like PTEN and components of the TGF-β pathway (Chen2006Ubiquitin; Chen2007The; Hu2021The). In breast cancer, WWP1 amplification is common, with overexpression linked to increased cell proliferation and survival (Chen2007The). In prostate cancer, WWP1 overexpression antagonizes TGF-β's inhibitory effects, contributing to tumorigenesis (Chen2006Ubiquitin).

WWP1 is also implicated in bone diseases like osteoporosis, where it affects osteogenesis by targeting RUNX2 and JUNB for degradation (Behera2023WWP1). In obesity, WWP1 is upregulated in white adipose tissue, influencing oxidative stress and mitochondrial function (Behera2023WWP1). Additionally, WWP1 overexpression in cardiomyocytes can lead to cardiac hypertrophy and arrhythmias (Behera2023WWP1). These roles highlight WWP1 as a potential therapeutic target across various conditions.

## Interactions
WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in numerous protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with LATS1, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, through its WW domains, specifically binding to LATS1's PPxY motifs. This interaction leads to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of LATS1 in breast cancer cells (Yeung2013WWP1). WWP1 also targets the ErbB4 protein for ubiquitination and degradation, interacting primarily through its first and third WW domains with ErbB4's second PY motif (Li2009WW).

In addition to these interactions, WWP1 forms a heterodimer with WWP2, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, to specifically target the ΔNp73 isoform for degradation, a process crucial for regulating apoptosis (Chaudhary2014WWP2WWP1). WWP1 also interacts with KLF5, a transcription factor, promoting its degradation in epithelial cells, which is significant in the context of prostate cancer (Chen2005Human).

WWP1's interactions extend to viral proteins, such as those from the Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2, influencing viral egress and potentially affecting disease severity (Behera2023WWP1). These interactions highlight WWP1's role in modulating protein stability and activity, impacting both normal physiological processes and disease mechanisms.
