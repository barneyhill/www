# PRMT6

## Overview
PRMT6 is a gene that encodes the protein arginine methyltransferase 6, a type I protein arginine methyltransferase. This enzyme is primarily located in the nucleus and is involved in the methylation of arginine residues on histones and other proteins, which plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and chromatin structure. PRMT6 is known for its ability to asymmetrically dimethylate histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2), acting as a transcriptional repressor by preventing the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling enzymes associated with active transcription (Bedford2009Protein; Blanc2017Arginine). Beyond its role in transcriptional regulation, PRMT6 is implicated in DNA repair processes and cellular proliferation, with its activity being modulated through automethylation (Singhroy2013Automethylation). The protein's interactions with various transcription factors and components of the Polycomb Repressive Complexes further underscore its importance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Hamey2021Systematic; Stein2016The).

## Structure
The human PRMT6 protein is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain that includes an N-terminal Rossmann fold and a C-terminal β-barrel domain. This structure is typical of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) and is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Wu2016Structural). The Rossmann fold domain forms a pocket that binds S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) through interactions involving hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Wu2016Structural). A notable structural feature of PRMT6 is the Y(F/Y)xxY motif located in the N-terminus, which is involved in SAH binding and catalysis. This motif can form an ordered helix, influencing the exposure of the SAH molecule (Wu2016Structural).

PRMT6 forms a dimer, with a unique dimerization arm that contributes to a flat dimer ring structure with a wide central cavity, potentially affecting substrate specificity (Wu2016Structural). The dimerization interface is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, a feature conserved among PRMTs (Wang2014Crystal). The protein's structure also includes a dynamic second glutamic acid residue (E164) in its double E-loop, which is essential for catalytic activity (Wu2016Structural). The presence of a conserved histidine residue (H317) is critical for the enzyme's ability to produce asymmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues (Wu2016Structural).

## Function
PRMT6 is a nuclear enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of arginine residues on histones and other proteins, influencing gene expression and chromatin structure. It is primarily responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2), which acts as a transcriptional repressor by preventing the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling enzymes associated with active gene transcription (Bedford2009Protein; Blanc2017Arginine). PRMT6 also methylates histones H4 and H2A at arginine 3, although the specific roles of these modifications are not fully understood (Bedford2009Protein).

In addition to its role in transcriptional repression, PRMT6 is involved in DNA repair processes. It interacts with DNA polymerase beta, enhancing its activity and processivity, which is crucial for base excision repair and maintaining genomic stability (Bedford2009Protein). PRMT6 also plays a role in cell proliferation and senescence, impacting cellular aging and differentiation (Blanc2017Arginine).

PRMT6's activity is regulated through automethylation, which increases its stability and influences its function in healthy human cells (Singhroy2013Automethylation). This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the kidney and testes, and is involved in regulating gene expression related to cell cycle regulation and stem cell characteristics (Chen2022The).

## Clinical Significance
PRMT6 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene expression regulation and interaction with key signaling pathways. In glioblastoma, elevated PRMT6 expression is linked to poor prognosis and tumorigenicity by repressing tumor suppressors such as p53, p21, and p16. Targeting PRMT6 with inhibitors may enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy in glioblastoma treatment (Huang2021PRMT6). In breast cancer, PRMT6 affects alternative splicing and transcription, influencing genes like PTEN and IGFBP3, which are associated with cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Its expression levels correlate with breast cancer outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Dowhan2012Protein).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRMT6 interacts with CRAF, affecting the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer stemness and drug resistance. PRMT6 downregulation in HCC is associated with aggressive cancer features, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chan2018PRMT6). In other cancers, such as osteosarcoma, bladder, gastric, and cervical cancers, PRMT6 is involved in cell cycle regulation and epigenetic modifications, making it a promising target for cancer therapy (Chen2022The).

## Interactions
PRMT6 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function and substrate specificity. It interacts with components of the Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), including subunits such as HPH1, HPH2, CBX4, CBX8, and BMI1, but not with CBX2 or MEL18. These interactions are not DNA-mediated and suggest a specific association of PRMT6 with PRC1, potentially influencing their repressive functions (Stein2016The). PRMT6 also interacts with the PRC2 subunit EZH2, which may enhance EZH2 activity by modifying the histone landscape (Stein2016The).

PRMT6 is known to interact with transcription factors such as RelA and RUNX1, and the transcription coregulator PELP1, which regulate its activity, particularly towards histone H3R2 (Hamey2021Systematic). It also interacts with the HIV-1 Tat and Rev proteins, affecting their function and consequently influencing HIV-1 production and replication. PRMT6 methylates the R52 and R53 residues of Tat, reducing its transactivation ability, and diminishes the export of viral RNA mediated by Rev (Invernizzi2006PRMT6; Xie2007Arginine). These interactions highlight PRMT6's role in modulating protein interactions and functions through arginine methylation.
