# CTNNA1

## Overview
CTNNA1 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin alpha 1, also known as αE-catenin, which is a pivotal component of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal linker protein, playing a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion by connecting E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby ensuring the structural integrity and polarity of epithelial cells (Vanpoucke2002The; Benjamin2008Bench). The αE-catenin protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of actin dynamics and assembly at adherens junctions, and it participates in signaling pathways that influence cell growth and survival (Vite2015New; Vasioukhin2001Hyperproliferation). Mutations in CTNNA1 have been linked to several diseases, such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and macular pattern dystrophy, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular adhesion and its potential disruption in disease pathogenesis (Saksens2015Mutations; Weren2018Role).

## Structure
The CTNNA1 gene encodes the αE-catenin protein, which is a crucial component of the E-cadherin/catenin cell adhesion complex. This protein plays a significant role in cell adhesion by linking E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells (Vanpoucke2002The). 

The αE-catenin protein contains three vinculin homology domains, an N-terminal α-catenin-binding site, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with F-actin. These structural features facilitate the linkage of the cadherin/α-catenin complex with the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the regulation of actin dynamics and assembly at adherens junctions (Vite2015New). 

Alternative splicing of CTNNA1 results in a truncated protein variant, which is distinct from other catenin family members that typically have in-frame alternative inserts. This truncated variant is rarely expressed and leads to a C-terminal truncation of the protein (Vanpoucke2002The). 

The αE-catenin protein is localized at the zonula adherens of epithelial cells, where it is essential for the functionality of adhesion junctions. Mutations in αE-catenin can lead to loose cellular adhesion in cancer cells, and restoring its expression can improve cell adhesion and reduce cell growth (Vanpoucke2002The).

## Function
The CTNNA1 gene encodes the protein α-catenin, which plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and the maintenance of tissue architecture. In healthy human cells, α-catenin is a key component of the cadherin/catenin complex, linking E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. This connection is essential for the stabilization of adherens junctions, which are critical for maintaining epithelial cell integrity and polarity (Hajra2002Cadherin; Benjamin2008Bench).

α-catenin functions as a molecular bridge, interacting with β-catenin and actin filaments. It binds to the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex as a monomer and bundles actin filaments as a homodimer, which can inhibit the Arp2/3 complex, thereby regulating actin dynamics and cell adhesion (Benjamin2008Bench). This regulation is vital for proper cell-cell contact and communication, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Vasioukhin2001Hyperproliferation).

In addition to its structural role, α-catenin is involved in signaling pathways that control cell growth and survival, such as the Ras-MAPK and Hedgehog pathways. It also regulates the Hippo pathway by controlling the localization and activity of the Yes-associated protein (Yap), which is crucial for cell cycle regulation (Vite2015New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTNNA1 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily affecting the retina and the gastrointestinal system. In the retina, CTNNA1 mutations have been linked to macular pattern dystrophy, specifically butterfly-shaped pattern dystrophy. This condition affects the retinal pigment epithelium and is characterized by visual symptoms such as difficulty in low light and mild distortion of vision. Several missense variants in CTNNA1 have been identified in patients with this condition, suggesting a strong association with the disease phenotype (Saksens2015Mutations; Tanner2021Clinical).

In the gastrointestinal system, CTNNA1 mutations are implicated in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Truncating germline variants in CTNNA1 have been found in patients with HDGC, leading to a loss of α-E-catenin protein expression in tumor cells. This loss is associated with increased cancer susceptibility, similar to mutations in the CDH1 gene (Majewski2013An; Weren2018Role; Benusiglio2018Clinical). The penetrance of CTNNA1 variants for diffuse gastric cancer is estimated to be significant, with a notable risk by age 80 (Guerra2023Frequency). These findings highlight the role of CTNNA1 in maintaining cellular adhesion and its disruption in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
CTNNA1, or catenin alpha 1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. It interacts with vinculin, a component of the cadherin-catenin complex, forming a heterologous head-to-tail complex. The vinculin head domain binds to the COOH-terminal region of α-catenin, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2-4 x 10^-7 M, indicating a strong interaction (Weiss1998Vinculin). This interaction is confirmed through various biochemical methods, including immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance (Weiss1998Vinculin).

CTNNA1 also acts as a molecular switch, existing as a monomer or homodimer with distinct binding properties. The monomer binds more strongly to E-cadherin-β-catenin, while the dimer preferentially binds actin filaments, indicating its role in regulating actin-filament assembly (Drees2005α-Catenin). It does not bind directly to actin filaments or indirectly through vinculin or α-actinin, suggesting a lack of stable linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and actin (Drees2005α-Catenin).

Additionally, CTNNA1 interacts with ZO-1, a protein involved in cadherin-based cell adhesion. N-ZO-1 binds directly to α-catenin, facilitating the linkage of the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton (Itoh1997Involvement).
