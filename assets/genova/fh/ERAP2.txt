# ERAP2

## Overview
ERAP2, or endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase enzyme involved in the antigen processing pathway. This enzyme is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in trimming antigenic peptide precursors to generate peptide ligands suitable for presentation by Major Histocompatibility Class I (MHC-I) molecules. This process is essential for the activation and repertoire shaping of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Sæterstad2024The; Saulle2019Endoplasmic). ERAP2 is a member of the M1 zinc metalloproteases family and works in conjunction with ERAP1 and IRAP to refine peptides for HLA-I antigen presentation (Mattorre2022A). The protein exhibits distinct substrate preferences, being most efficient with arginine residues and shorter peptides, and is known to form both homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with ERAP1, enhancing its role in antigen processing (Papakyriakou2022Can; López2018How). Polymorphisms in the ERAP2 gene can significantly influence its expression and enzymatic activity, impacting various physiological and pathological processes, including autoimmune diseases and blood pressure regulation (Kuśnierczyk2022To; Agrawal2014Genetic).

## Structure
ERAP2 is a Zn-metallopeptidase involved in antigen processing, sharing about 50% sequence identity with ERAP1. It consists of four globular domains, with the catalytic site located in domain II and a substrate-binding site spanning domains II and IV (López2018How). The protein has a unique extended loop, encompassing residues 500-520, which includes a disulfide bridge formed by Cys503 and Cys514, and a specific Asp-Pro motif. This motif is sensitive to pH variations, potentially leading to cleavage under acidic conditions, resulting in a ~55 kDa fragment (Mattorre2022A). 

ERAP2 typically forms homodimers, primarily through interactions in the N-terminal domain I, with a total buried surface area of 1150 Å² (Papakyriakou2022Can). It can also form heterodimers with ERAP1, which may enhance their synergistic role in antigen processing (Papakyriakou2022Can). The exon 10 sequence of ERAP2, involved in retention mechanisms through disulfide bond formation, is not conserved in ERAP1 (Papakyriakou2022Can). 

ERAP2 is polymorphic, with notable polymorphisms affecting its expression and activity, such as the K392N change, which impacts enzymatic activity and expression levels (López2018How). The protein also exists in shorter isoforms, such as the ~55 kDa form, which is expressed in macrophages (Mattorre2022A).

## Function
ERAP2 (endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2) is a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in the antigen processing pathway. It trims the N-terminal extensions of antigenic peptide precursors to generate peptide ligands suitable for presentation by Major Histocompatibility Class I (MHC-I) molecules, which is essential for shaping the cytotoxic T lymphocyte repertoire and activation (Sæterstad2024The; Saulle2019Endoplasmic). ERAP2 is part of the M1 zinc metalloproteases family and works alongside ERAP1 and IRAP in refining peptides for HLA-I antigen presentation (Mattorre2022A).

ERAP2 has distinct substrate preferences, being most efficient with Arg residues and cleaving best 9-mers and shorter peptides, contrasting with ERAP1's preference for nonpolar residues and longer peptides (López2018How). Beyond its intracellular role, ERAP2 may also participate in extracellular processes such as angiogenesis and blood pressure regulation, similar to its paralog ERAP1 (Saulle2019Endoplasmic). It is secreted by immune-competent cells and retains antiviral properties, potentially modulating the immune system even in the extracellular environment (Saulle2019Endoplasmic). ERAP2's activity is influenced by polymorphisms, which can affect its expression and enzymatic activity (López2018How).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ERAP2 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. ERAP2 polymorphisms, particularly the rs2248374 and rs2549782 SNPs, are associated with autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The rs2248374 SNP is a 'loss-of-function' variant that leads to RNA instability and reduced ERAP2 expression, affecting MHC class I surface expression and providing protection against ankylosing spondylitis and IBD (Evnouchidou2012A; Agrawal2014Genetic). The rs2549782 SNP results in a change in enzyme specificity, influencing antigen processing and is linked to resistance to HIV infection and susceptibility to pre-eclampsia (Evnouchidou2012A).

ERAP2 also plays a role in the pathogenesis of birdshot chorioretinopathy, where its polymorphisms, along with ERAP1, affect the HLA-A*29-bound immunopeptidome (Kuśnierczyk2022To). In Hodgkin lymphoma, ERAP2 SNPs interact with specific HLA class I types, influencing antigen presentation and disease development (Jiang2021Interaction). Additionally, ERAP2 variants can impact blood pressure regulation and exacerbate conditions like hypertension during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Kuśnierczyk2022To).

## Interactions
ERAP2 interacts with several proteins, notably forming complexes with IRAP and ERAP1. A short form of ERAP2, generated through autocatalytic cleavage in an acidic environment, binds strongly to IRAP in macrophages. This interaction occurs in endosomes and is characterized by a ~55 kDa fragment of ERAP2 co-immunoprecipitating with IRAP, indicating a strong association. The interaction is supported by protein-protein docking studies, which suggest that ERAP2 forms a pseudo-symmetric heterodimer with IRAP, with extensive contacts between the N-terminal region of ERAP2 and IRAP (Mattorre2022A).

ERAP2 also has the potential to form functional heterodimers with ERAP1. These interactions are explored through molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest a likely heterodimerization topology involving the exon 10 loop. The ERAP1/ERAP2 heterodimer models indicate enhanced peptide trimming function, particularly through increased ERAP1 activity. The interaction is characterized by specific amino acid interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bridges, which contribute to the stability of the heterodimer (Papakyriakou2022Can).
