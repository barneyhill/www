# SPRED3

## Overview
SPRED3 is a gene that encodes the protein sprouty related EVH1 domain containing 3, which is a member of the SPRED protein family. This protein is involved in the negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Unlike other SPRED proteins, SPRED3 lacks a functional c-Kit-binding domain, which affects its ability to bind and be phosphorylated by c-Kit, yet it still plays a role in inhibiting ERK activation, albeit less effectively than SPRED1 and SPRED2 (He2020Spred3; Gong2020Progress). SPRED3 is primarily expressed in brain tissue, indicating a specialized function in neural signaling (He2020Spred3). The protein interacts with various cellular components, including neurofibromin and the S-acyltransferase zDHHC17, highlighting its unique role in cellular signaling and potential as a therapeutic target (Butler2023Sacylation; Lorenzo2020SPRED).

## Structure
SPRED3 is a protein composed of 410 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 42.670 kDa. It features several distinct domains: an N-terminal EVH1/WH1 domain (amino acids 1-113), a central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD) region (amino acids 195-244), and a C-terminal SPR domain (amino acids 296-407) (Butler2023Sacylation). The EVH1 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and has a weaker binding affinity to neurofibromin compared to SPRED1 and SPRED2, possibly due to differences in amino acid sequence and tertiary structure (Lorenzo2020SPRED). The SPR domain is crucial for membrane localization and Ras signaling inhibition, facilitating the translocation of neurofibromin to the plasma membrane (Lorenzo2020SPRED).

SPRED3 lacks a functional c-Kit-binding domain due to a Gly-240 residue instead of a critical Ala-247, which is necessary for c-Kit binding, rendering it unable to bind to or be phosphorylated by c-Kit (Butler2023Sacylation). Despite lacking a consensus zDABM sequence, SPRED3 can interact with and be S-acylated by the enzyme zDHHC17, indicating a novel mode of enzyme-substrate interaction (Butler2023Sacylation). The SPR domain is implicated in this interaction, although the specific residues involved remain unidentified (Butler2023Sacylation). SPRED3 also contains two polar regions and a proline-rich region (amino acids 260-283) (Butler2023Sacylation).

## Function
SPRED3 is a member of the SPRED protein family, which plays a role in negatively regulating the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, a crucial pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. SPRED3, like other SPRED proteins, inhibits the activation of Raf kinase, thereby preventing downstream activation of the MAPK pathway (Gong2020Progress). This regulation is essential for maintaining normal cellular signaling and preventing excessive cell proliferation (He2020Spred3).

Structurally, SPRED3 contains an N-terminal EVH-1 domain and a C-terminal Sprouty-like cysteine-rich domain (SRY), but it lacks the central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD) found in other SPRED proteins (He2020Spred3; Gong2020Progress). Despite the absence of the KBD, SPRED3 can still inhibit ERK activation, although less effectively than SPRED1 and SPRED2 (Gong2020Progress). SPRED3 is primarily expressed in brain tissue, suggesting a specialized role in neural signaling (He2020Spred3).

In healthy human cells, SPRED3 functions as a suppressor of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, contributing to the regulation of cellular growth and development (He2020Spred3). Its activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing oncogenic transformation (He2020Spred3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPRED3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid carcinoma (THCA). In NSCLC, a deletion mutation in the SPRED3 gene, specifically c.120delG at exon 1, has been associated with acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) like erlotinib. This mutation leads to a frameshift and loss of function, resulting in reduced SPRED3 expression and increased activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, contributing to drug resistance and enhanced cell migration (He2020Spred3).

In thyroid carcinoma, SPRED3 is significantly upregulated and serves as a prognostic marker. High SPRED3 expression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. Unlike SPRED1 and SPRED2, which inhibit the Ras/MAPK pathway, SPRED3 in THCA is associated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt and IL-17 signaling pathways, potentially contributing to cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance (Zhang2024Bioinformatics). These findings suggest that SPRED3 could be a target for therapeutic development in high-risk THCA patients and may influence the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Zhang2024Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
SPRED3 interacts with the S-acyltransferase zDHHC17, despite lacking the typical zDHHC ankyrin binding motif (zDABM) that facilitates such interactions in other proteins. This suggests a novel mode of interaction, possibly involving the SPR domain of SPRED3, which is crucial for its binding and S-acylation by zDHHC17 (Butler2023Sacylation). The interaction does not require the ankyrin repeat domain of zDHHC17, indicating that other regions of the enzyme may be involved (Butler2023Sacylation).

SPRED3 also interacts with neurofibromin through its EVH1 domain, although this interaction is weaker compared to other SPRED proteins due to structural differences (Lorenzo2020SPRED). SPRED3 can form dimers with other proteins, which is essential for its role in regulating the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway (Gong2020Progress). Additionally, SPRED3 interacts with caveolin-1, localizing in lipid rafts/caveolae, and is palmitoylated by the palmitoyl acetyltransferase HIP14 (Lorenzo2020SPRED). These interactions highlight SPRED3's unique role in cellular signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
