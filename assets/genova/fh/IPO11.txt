# IPO11

## Overview
Importin 11 (IPO11) is a gene that encodes the protein importin 11, a member of the karyopherin-β family, which functions as a nuclear import receptor. This protein plays a crucial role in the nuclear transport of various proteins by interacting with the Ran GTPase, a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Importin 11 is specifically involved in the nuclear import of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcM2, among other proteins, and is implicated in several cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Plafker2000Importin11; Nachmias2022IPO11). The gene has clinical significance, with mutations and expression alterations linked to disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and various cancers, including AML and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Zhao2016Wholeexome; Zuo2015Significant; Nachmias2022IPO11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IPO11 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), rare variants in the IPO11-HTR1A region have been significantly associated with the disorder in Caucasian populations. These rare variants, particularly in the intergenic region and IPO11 itself, may influence disease risk by regulating transcription of causal variants, as supported by cis-eQTL findings (Zuo2015Significant). 

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IPO11 is identified as a critical target, especially in leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Its expression is significantly higher in LSCs compared to normal hematopoietic cells, and its knockdown reduces cell viability and induces cell cycle arrest. High IPO11 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes, including lower overall survival, and correlates with mutations in genes like c-KIT, DNMT3A, and NRAS (Nachmias2022IPO11).

In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, recurrent copy number variations in IPO11 have been identified, with overexpression linked to poor survival outcomes. This suggests that IPO11 may promote tumor progression by facilitating the nuclear translocation of proteins involved in the ubiquitin degradation pathway, potentially leading to the degradation of tumor suppressors (Zhao2016Wholeexome).

## Interactions
Importin 11 (IPO11) is a nuclear import receptor that participates in several key protein interactions. It is a member of the karyopherin-β family and is involved in the nuclear transport of proteins. IPO11 interacts with the Ran GTPase, a common feature among karyopherin family members, which is essential for nuclear transport. This interaction is crucial for the dissociation of cargo proteins once they reach the nucleus (Plafker2000Importin11).

IPO11 specifically binds to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcM2, facilitating its nuclear import. This interaction is direct and specific, as demonstrated by various binding assays, and is regulated by the Ran GTPase system. The presence of Ran:GTP triggers the dissociation of the UbcM2-IPO11 complex, highlighting the role of IPO11 in the nuclear import of UbcM2 (Plafker2000Importin11).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IPO11 is involved in the nuclear import of the transcription factors BZW1 and BZW2. These interactions are critical for maintaining the stem-like properties of leukemia stem cells. Knockdown of IPO11 disrupts the nuclear localization of these transcription factors, affecting AML cell growth and viability (Nachmias2022IPO11).
