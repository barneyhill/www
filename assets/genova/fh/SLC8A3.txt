# SLC8A3

## Overview
The SLC8A3 gene encodes the sodium-calcium exchanger 3 (NCX3), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular calcium homeostasis. NCX3 is primarily expressed in excitable tissues such as the brain and skeletal muscle, where it facilitates the exchange of intracellular calcium ions for extracellular sodium ions, thus maintaining optimal intracellular calcium levels. This exchange is crucial for various physiological processes, including muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release. Structurally, NCX3 comprises ten transmembrane helices and features regulatory calcium-binding domains that modulate its activity. The protein's function is essential for preventing calcium overload, which can lead to cellular damage and is implicated in several neurological and muscular disorders (Khananshvili2013The; Spencer2020Sodium–Calcium; Sokolow2004Impaired).

## Structure
The SLC8A3 gene encodes the sodium-calcium exchanger 3 (NCX3), which is a crucial component of cellular calcium homeostasis. The protein structure includes ten transmembrane helices arranged in two pseudo-symmetrical halves, forming a tightly packed core domain. This arrangement facilitates the exchange of intracellular calcium for extracellular sodium ions (Giladi2016Structural; Spencer2020Sodium–Calcium). Within the transmembrane region, conserved α-repeat motifs in helices TM2-3 and TM7-8 are responsible for ion recognition and translocation, forming a pocket with twelve ion-coordinating residues and four ion-binding sites (Spencer2020Sodium–Calcium).

The protein also features a large cytosolic f-loop between TM5 and TM6, which contains regulatory calcium-binding domains (CBD1 and CBD2). CBD1 acts as the primary high-affinity calcium sensor, while CBD2 is subject to alternative splicing, affecting the protein's kinetic properties (Spencer2020Sodium–Calcium; Khananshvili2020Basic). The interdomain linker between CBD1 and CBD2 is crucial for the synergistic interactions and functional coupling of these domains (Khananshvili2020Basic).

NCX3 is primarily expressed in the brain and skeletal muscle, and its activity is modulated by various factors, including non-transported ions, phospholipids, and interacting proteins (Spencer2020Sodium–Calcium). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. Splice variants of SLC8A3 result in different isoforms with potentially distinct functional properties (Khananshvili2013The).

## Function
The SLC8A3 gene encodes the sodium-calcium exchanger 3 (NCX3), a protein crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis in excitable tissues such as the brain and skeletal muscle. NCX3 facilitates the exchange of sodium and calcium ions across the cell membrane, playing a vital role in regulating intracellular calcium levels. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release (Michel2014Function; Khananshvili2013The).

In skeletal muscle, NCX3 is involved in mediating calcium efflux and influx, which is critical for controlling intracellular calcium concentration and preventing calcium overload. This function is necessary for proper neuromuscular transmission and muscle integrity, as evidenced by the impaired neuromuscular function and muscle fiber necrosis observed in NCX3-deficient mice (Sokolow2004Impaired).

In the brain, NCX3 is expressed in neurons, where it helps prevent calcium overload and neuronal degeneration. It is particularly important in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, where it contributes to neuronal survival by preventing mitochondrial calcium accumulation and oxidative stress (Chleilat2020TGFβ). NCX3 also plays a role in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation, supporting normal brain function and structure (Spencer2020Sodium–Calcium).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC8A3 gene, which encodes the sodium/calcium exchanger 3 (NCX3), have been implicated in several neurological and muscular disorders. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SLC8A3 is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis in neurons. Dysregulation of SLC8A3 expression can lead to increased oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration, as seen in conditions like Parkinson's disease, where calcium dysregulation is a key factor (Chleilat2020TGFβ). The gene's expression is regulated by TGF-β signaling, and its downregulation is associated with increased markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases (Chleilat2020TGFβ).

In muscular disorders, mice lacking the SLC8A3 gene exhibit muscle fiber necrosis and impaired neuromuscular transmission, leading to muscle weakness and easy fatigability. This suggests that SLC8A3 is essential for proper muscle function and that its dysregulation could contribute to muscular dystrophies (Khananshvili2013The). In the central nervous system, SLC8A3 is involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation, and its absence can exacerbate conditions like multiple sclerosis by impairing myelin repair mechanisms (Casamassa2016Ncx3).
