# SPACA3

## Overview
The SPACA3 gene encodes the sperm acrosome associated 3 protein, commonly referred to as SPRASA, which is a lysozyme-like protein involved in the fertilization process. This protein is primarily localized in the acrosome of sperm cells, where it plays a crucial role in sperm-oocyte recognition and binding, facilitating successful fertilization (Prendergast2014SPACA3gene; Nagdas2016Identification). SPRASA is involved in the acrosome reaction, a key event that enables sperm to penetrate the egg's outer layers, and interacts with other acrosomal proteins, such as SAS1B, to mediate sperm-egg fusion (Ito2016Acrosome; Nagdas2016Identification). Beyond its reproductive functions, SPACA3 has been implicated in clinical contexts, including its potential role in infertility and as a biomarker in certain cancers (Ramsey2023Comparing; Kim2020Prognostication).

## Function
The SPACA3 gene encodes a protein known as SPRASA, which is involved in critical processes related to fertilization. SPRASA is localized in the acrosome of human sperm, where it plays a significant role in sperm-oocyte recognition and binding, essential for successful fertilization (Prendergast2014SPACA3gene; Nagdas2016Identification). This protein is a non-bacteriolytic lysozyme-like protein, and its presence is noted on the inner acrosomal membrane of sperm in humans and other mammals (Ramsey2023Comparing).

In the context of sperm physiology, SPACA3 is involved in the acrosome reaction, a process crucial for the penetration of the egg's outer layers, facilitating sperm-egg fusion (Ito2016Acrosome; Nagdas2016Identification). The protein interacts with other acrosomal proteins, such as SAS1B, which is localized on the oolemma of oocytes, indicating its role in the fertilization process (Ito2016Acrosome). SPACA3's function extends to its potential involvement in early embryo development, as it is a target for antisperm antibodies, which can impact fertility (Prendergast2014SPACA3gene). The expression of SPACA3 in oocytes further supports its critical role in reproductive biology (Prendergast2014SPACA3gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPACA3 gene have been investigated for their potential role in human infertility. The gene encodes the SPRASA protein, which is involved in sperm-oocyte recognition and binding, crucial processes for successful fertilization. Variants in SPACA3, such as an insertion in the 5′ untranslated region and a non-synonymous substitution in the transmembrane region, have been identified, but their direct association with infertility remains inconclusive due to similar frequencies in both infertile and fertile populations (Prendergast2014SPACA3gene).

SPACA3 is also a target for antisperm antibodies, which can interfere with sperm function and contribute to infertility. High levels of SPACA3 antibodies have been found in some infertile women, suggesting a possible link between these antibodies and reproductive challenges (Ramsey2023Comparing). In animal models, SPACA3 antibodies have been shown to reduce fertilization and inhibit embryonic development, indicating that similar mechanisms might affect human fertility (Ramsey2023Comparing).

In cancer research, SPACA3 has been identified as part of biomarker panels for prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting its expression levels may influence cancer outcomes (Kim2020Prognostication; Patel2021A).

## Interactions
SPACA3, also known as SLLP1, is a lysozyme-like protein that plays a significant role in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization. It is known to interact with a 32-kDa acrosomal matrix protein (OMC32) in bovine sperm, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of acrosin release during the acrosome reaction, which is crucial for sperm-zona interaction (Nagdas2016Identification). SPACA3 is highly expressed in the testis and epididymis and is localized in the acrosome of human spermatozoa, present on the luminal surface of both inner and outer acrosomal membranes (Nagdas2016Identification).

In mice, SPACA3 binds to receptors within the perivitelline space and on the oocyte plasma membrane, indicating its role in sperm-oolemma interaction during fertilization (Leung2023The). The interaction of SPACA3 with the oolemma metalloprotease SAS1B is crucial for sperm-egg adhesion and fusion, although SPACA3 knockout males remain fertile, suggesting compensatory mechanisms may exist (Gahlay2020The). These interactions highlight the importance of SPACA3 in the fertilization process, although its exact role and necessity in humans require further investigation.
