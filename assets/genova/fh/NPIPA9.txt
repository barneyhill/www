# NPIPA9

## Overview
The NPIPA9 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member A9, which is part of a group of proteins involved in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. This protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, a critical structure that facilitates the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although the specific functions of NPIPA9 are not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are generally implicated in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and regulating gene expression by modulating the transport of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. The study of NPIPA9 and its interactions is ongoing, with potential implications for understanding various cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
