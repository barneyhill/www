# TUBB8

## Overview
TUBB8 is a gene that encodes the tubulin beta 8 class VIII protein, a primate-specific isotype of β-tubulin. This protein is a critical component of the microtubule network, predominantly expressed in human oocytes and early embryos. As a structural protein, tubulin beta 8 class VIII plays a vital role in the assembly and function of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The protein is particularly crucial for the formation of the meiotic spindle, a structure necessary for chromosome segregation during meiosis, thereby playing a significant role in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development (Dou2023Phenotypic; Feng2016Mutations). Mutations in the TUBB8 gene have been linked to infertility-related conditions due to their impact on microtubule integrity and function, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in reproductive biology (Yu2022Identification; Chen2016Novel).

## Structure
The TUBB8 gene encodes a primate-specific isotype of β-tubulin, which is a key component of the microtubule network in human oocytes and early embryos. The primary structure of TUBB8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, which is crucial for its function in microtubule assembly (Feng2016Mutations; Hu2023Novel). 

The secondary structure of the TUBB8 protein includes regions of α-helices and β-sheets. Specific variants, such as p.G13R, p.L42V, and p.V255M, are located in the α-helix region, while others like p.I4L, p.Y50C, and p.T366A occur in the β-folding region (Hu2023Novel). These structural elements are essential for the stability and function of the protein.

In terms of tertiary structure, TUBB8 forms a three-dimensional conformation that is critical for its role in forming heterodimers with α-tubulin. These heterodimers are integral to the quaternary structure, assembling into microtubules that are vital for cellular processes such as spindle assembly during meiosis and mitosis (Yu2022Identification; Dou2023Phenotypic).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, can influence the function of tubulin proteins, although specific modifications for TUBB8 are not detailed in the provided context. Variants in TUBB8 can lead to structural disruptions, affecting microtubule integrity and function (Hu2023Novel).

## Function
The TUBB8 gene encodes a primate-specific β-tubulin isotype that is uniquely expressed in human oocytes and early embryos. This protein plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Dou2023Phenotypic; Feng2016Mutations). In particular, TUBB8 is vital for the formation of the meiotic spindle, a structure critical for chromosome segregation during meiosis. This process is necessary for the progression of oocytes from metaphase I to metaphase II, which is essential for successful fertilization and reproduction (Dou2023Phenotypic; Feng2016Mutationsa).

In healthy human cells, TUBB8 contributes to the proper formation and function of the meiotic spindle by assembling into α/β-tubulin heterodimers, which are crucial for microtubule architecture and dynamics (Feng2016Mutationsa). The protein's activity is primarily localized in oocytes and early embryos, where it accounts for almost all the expressed β-tubulin, underscoring its specialized function in these cells (Feng2016Mutations). Proper TUBB8 function ensures the stability and dynamics of microtubules, which are critical for cell division and development (Feng2016Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBB8 gene are associated with various infertility-related conditions in women, primarily due to their impact on oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. TUBB8 mutations can lead to oocyte maturation arrest, fertilization failure, early embryonic arrest, and recurrent embryo transfer failure (Yu2022Identification; Chen2018The). These mutations disrupt microtubule assembly, affecting spindle formation and cell division, which are crucial for successful oocyte maturation and fertilization (Chen2016Novel; Yao2022Mutation).

The phenotypic spectrum of TUBB8 mutations is broad, with some mutations causing oocytes to arrest at the metaphase I (MI) stage, while others result in fertilization failure at the metaphase II (MII) stage or early embryonic development arrest (Zheng2021The; Liu2021TUBB8). Specific mutations, such as p.A54V and p.R320H, have been identified as causing developmental arrest in human oocytes and early embryos (Cao2021Two).

TUBB8 mutations can follow autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance patterns, and their effects may be due to dominant-negative effects or haploinsufficiency (Chen2016Novel). Genetic screening for TUBB8 variants is recommended for women experiencing unexplained infertility or repeated IVF failures (Dou2023Phenotypic).

## Interactions
TUBB8 interacts with various proteins that influence its role in microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly. One significant interaction is with KIF11, a motor protein essential for proper spindle function. The ectopic expression of TUBB8 in mouse oocytes results in reduced recruitment of KIF11 on MI spindles, which correlates with less stretched bivalents and increased aneuploidy. This interaction is less strong compared to TUBB4A, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Injecting human KIF11 cRNA into oocytes expressing TUBB8 partially rescues spindle defects, indicating a compensatory role of KIF11 (Dong2023Ectopic).

TUBB8 also affects the phosphorylation of HEC1 by aurora kinases B/C (AURKB/C), which destabilizes correct kinetochore-microtubule (K-MT) attachments. This continuous phosphorylation is linked to reduced tension in stretched bivalents, contributing to erroneous K-MT attachments and increased aneuploidy (Dong2023Ectopic).

The C-terminal tail of TUBB8 may undergo post-translational modifications that influence its interactions with microtubule dynamics and motor proteins, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear (Dong2023Ectopic). These interactions highlight TUBB8's role in spindle assembly and its potential impact on aneuploidy in human eggs.
