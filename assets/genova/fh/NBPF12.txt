# NBPF12

## Overview
The NBPF12 gene encodes the NBPF member 12 protein, which is part of the Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family, a group of proteins characterized by the presence of DUF1220 domains. These domains are notable for their association with brain size and cognitive function, and they are significantly more numerous in humans than in other primates, suggesting a role in human brain evolution (Paar2021Global; Glunčić2022Tandemly). The NBPF12 protein is believed to function as a DNA-binding transcription factor due to its nuclear localization signals and conserved N-terminal region, which includes DNA-binding domains similar to those found in other transcription factors (Zhou2013NBPF). The gene is located on chromosome 1 in the 1q21 region and is implicated in neural development, particularly during corticogenesis, where it may influence neural stem cell proliferation (Boehm2024Rapid; Wu2020The). Despite these associations, the detailed cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms of NBPF12 remain to be fully elucidated (Wu2020The).

## Structure
The NBPF12 protein is part of the Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family, characterized by the presence of DUF1220 domains, which are repetitive structures associated with brain size and function (Paar2021Global). These domains are approximately 1.6 kilobases in length and are organized into higher-order repeats (HORs) in the human genome, specifically forming 3mer HORs (Glunčić2022Tandemly). The DUF1220 domains are composed of two evenly spaced exons, and the copy number of these domains is significantly higher in humans compared to other primates, suggesting a role in human brain evolution (Paar2021Global).

The NBPF12 protein contains classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are short amino acid sequences that facilitate its transport into the nucleus (Zhou2013NBPF). The N-terminal region of NBPF12 is highly conserved and includes DNA-binding domains similar to those found in the transcription factors stat3b and stat-1, indicating a potential role as a DNA-binding transcription factor (Zhou2013NBPF). The 3D structure of NBPF12 has been predicted using the Phyre2 program, which modeled it based on known DNA-binding complexes, covering about 250 residues of the N-terminal region with high confidence (Zhou2013NBPF).

## Function
NBPF12, a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, is primarily located on chromosome 1, specifically in the 1q21 region. This gene family is characterized by the presence of DUF1220 protein domains, which are associated with brain development and cognitive functions (Wu2020The). NBPF12 is expressed during human corticogenesis and may play a role in neural stem cell proliferation, suggesting its involvement in brain development (Boehm2024Rapid).

The NBPF12 gene is implicated in the regulation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a pathway that degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons to prevent the production of truncated proteins. This regulation is crucial during neurodevelopment, as it affects the expression of genes involved in brain development (Boehm2024Rapid). The proteins encoded by NBPF12 contain Olduvai domains, which have been linked to primate brain size and disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (Wu2020The).

Despite these insights, the precise cellular functions and regulation of NBPF12 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown. Further research is needed to elucidate its specific roles and mechanisms in cellular and organismal contexts (Wu2020The).
