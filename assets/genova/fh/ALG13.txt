# ALG13

## Overview
ALG13 is a gene that encodes the ALG13 UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit, a crucial component of the enzyme complex involved in N-linked glycosylation. This process is essential for the proper folding and function of glycoproteins within human cells. The ALG13 protein, categorized as a glycosyltransferase, forms a heterodimer with ALG14, facilitating the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to lipid-linked oligosaccharides, a key step in glycoprotein biosynthesis. The ALG13 protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum, where it performs its enzymatic functions. Mutations in the ALG13 gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, particularly affecting the central nervous system, and are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders (Alsharhan2021ALG13; Mitusińska2022Structural).

## Structure
The ALG13 protein is a subunit of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex, essential for N-linked glycosylation. Its primary structure is encoded by the ALG13 gene, and it exists in two isoforms: the long ALG13-is1 and the short ALG13-is2. These isoforms share the N-terminal region, which contains the catalytic domain, but differ in their C-terminal regions. The long isoform has ubiquitinase activity, while the short isoform is crucial for shuttling ALG13 to the endoplasmic reticulum and interacting with ALG14 (Mitusińska2022Structural).

The secondary structure of ALG13 includes a GT-B fold, characterized by two central Rossmann-like folds flanked by additional helices. The N-terminal half of ALG13 features a mixed α/β domain, while the C-terminal half retains a conserved Rossmann fold typical of GT-B enzymes (Wang2008Solution). The ALG13 protein also contains an extended C-terminal α-helix, which is crucial for its interaction with ALG14 (Gao2008Interaction).

In terms of quaternary structure, ALG13 forms a heterodimer with ALG14, which is necessary for its enzymatic activity. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal regions of both proteins (Gao2008Interaction). The Asn107Ser mutation in ALG13 affects its flexibility and interaction with ALG14, although it does not directly involve substrate binding (Mitusińska2022Structural).

## Function
The ALG13 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the N-glycosylation process. This process is essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins in human cells. ALG13, in conjunction with ALG14, forms a heterodimeric complex that functions as a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase. This complex is involved in the early steps of lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) synthesis, specifically extending GlcNAc 1-PP-dolichol to GlcNAc 2-PP-dolichol, a precursor step in the assembly of high mannose N-glycans (Alsharhan2021ALG13; Mitusińska2022Structural).

The ALG13 protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm but can also be found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as part of the ALG13-ALG14 complex. This localization is crucial for its role in N-glycosylation, a process that occurs in the ER and Golgi apparatus (Mitusińska2022Structural). The interaction between ALG13 and ALG14 is vital for cell viability and proper glycosylation, and defects in this interaction can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) (Mitusińska2022Structural). The ALG13 protein's function is evolutionarily conserved, as it is related to the bacterial MurG UDP-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase, indicating its importance in cellular processes (Mitusińska2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG13 gene are associated with ALG13-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG13-CDG), a rare X-linked disorder primarily affecting the central nervous system. This condition is characterized by a range of neurological and developmental issues, including early-onset seizures, infantile spasms, epileptic encephalopathy, and global developmental delay (Shah2023Long‐term; Alsharhan2021ALG13). The most common pathogenic variants are N107S and A81T, which impact the glycosyltransferase 28 domain of the ALG13 protein (Shah2023Long‐term). These mutations can lead to severe phenotypes such as West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with seizures typically beginning around 6-8 months of age (Ng2020Predominant).

The disorder is also associated with intellectual disability, developmental delays, behavioral abnormalities, and muscular hypotonia. Some females with ALG13-CDG may experience cardiac involvement, while males with loss of function variants might present with additional liver, coagulation, or endocrine abnormalities (Shah2023Long‐term). Despite its role in glycosylation, ALG13-CDG does not show typical glycosylation defects, complicating diagnosis and highlighting the need for specific biomarkers (Ng2020Predominant). Treatment options for epilepsy in ALG13-CDG include ACTH and prednisolone, with ketogenic diets showing some promise (Ng2020Predominant).

## Interactions
ALG13 interacts with ALG14 to form a functional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex, which is essential for the N-linked glycosylation process. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal regions of both proteins. The C-terminal α-helix of ALG13 and the last three amino acids of ALG14 are crucial for their binding, forming a hydrophobic pocket that facilitates the interaction (Gao2008Interaction). Mutations or deletions in these regions can disrupt the complex formation, leading to impaired function (Gao2008Interaction).

ALG14 acts as a membrane anchor, recruiting ALG13 to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the glycosylation process occurs. This recruitment is necessary for the localization and function of ALG13, as it lacks membrane-spanning domains (Gao2005Alg14). The interaction between ALG13 and ALG14 is highly specific, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Gao2005Alg14).

Human orthologues of ALG13 and ALG14 can complement yeast mutants only when both are expressed together, indicating evolutionary divergence in their interaction capabilities (Gao2005Alg14). The ALG13/14 complex is also implicated in the regulation of protein activity and substrate recruitment (Mitusińska2022Structural).
