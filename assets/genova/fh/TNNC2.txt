# TNNC2

## Overview
The TNNC2 gene encodes the fast skeletal muscle troponin C protein, a crucial component of the troponin complex involved in the regulation of muscle contraction. This protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protein, specifically functioning within fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. Troponin C2, fast skeletal type, plays a pivotal role in the calcium-mediated regulation of muscle contraction by facilitating the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. The protein's structure includes EF-hand motifs that bind calcium ions, triggering conformational changes essential for muscle contraction (van2021Pathogenic; Murgia2021Protein). Pathogenic variants in TNNC2 can lead to congenital myopathy, highlighting its significance in muscle function and stability (van2021Pathogenic).

## Structure
The TNNC2 gene encodes the fast skeletal troponin C (fsTnC) protein, which is a critical component of the troponin complex involved in muscle contraction. The primary structure of fsTnC consists of amino acid sequences that form EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures responsible for binding calcium ions (van2021Pathogenic). These motifs are crucial for the protein's function in muscle contraction, as calcium binding triggers conformational changes that facilitate the interaction with other components of the troponin complex, such as troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT) (van2021Pathogenic).

The tertiary structure of fsTnC involves the folding of these EF-hand motifs, creating a configuration that allows for effective calcium binding and interaction with TnI. The quaternary structure includes its integration into the troponin complex on the actin-based thin filament, which is essential for regulating muscle contraction (van2021Pathogenic).

Pathogenic variants in TNNC2, such as D34Y and M79I, can alter the protein's structure and function, affecting calcium sensitivity and muscle contraction (van2021Pathogenic). These variants can disrupt the interaction between fsTnC and TnI, leading to congenital myopathy characterized by impaired force response to calcium (van2021Pathogenic).

## Function
The TNNC2 gene encodes the fast skeletal muscle troponin C protein, which plays a critical role in the regulation of muscle contraction in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. This protein is a component of the troponin complex, which also includes troponin I and troponin T. TNNC2 specifically binds calcium ions, a process that triggers conformational changes in the troponin complex. These changes facilitate the interaction between actin and myosin filaments, which is essential for muscle contraction (Murgia2021Protein; Dowling2023FiberType).

TNNC2 is predominantly expressed in type 2 muscle fibers, which are specialized for rapid and forceful contractions. These fibers are characterized by a higher abundance of glycolytic enzymes and proteins like ATP2A1 (SERCA1) and MCT4, which support the rapid energy demands of fast-twitch muscles (Murgia2021Protein). The presence of TNNC2 in these fibers underscores its role in facilitating quick muscle responses, which are crucial for activities requiring sudden bursts of strength or speed (Murgia2021Protein).

In addition to its role in muscle contraction, TNNC2 is involved in maintaining the balance between protein degradation and synthesis in muscle fibers, which is important for muscle function and stability (Li2024Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNNC2 gene, which encodes the fast skeletal troponin C, have been linked to a distinct form of congenital myopathy. This condition is characterized by congenital muscle weakness, severe respiratory muscle involvement, and atypical clinical improvement over time. Two specific missense variants, c.100G>T (p.Asp34Tyr; D34Y) and c.237G>C (p.Met79Ile; M79I), have been identified in unrelated families and are associated with this myopathy. These variants disrupt calcium binding and the interaction with troponin I, leading to a reduced force response in muscle fibers (van2021Pathogenic).

Patients with these TNNC2 variants exhibit symptoms such as facial weakness, ptosis, decreased extraocular movements, and jaw contractures. Despite the initial severity, the condition shows improvement over time, which is unusual for congenital myopathies (van2021Pathogenic). The pathogenicity of these variants is supported by molecular dynamics simulations and physiological studies, which demonstrate impaired calcium sensitivity and force generation in affected muscle fibers (van2021Pathogenic).

Therapeutic strategies, such as the use of troponin activators like tirasemtiv and gene therapy approaches, are being explored to restore normal muscle function by improving calcium sensitivity and force production (van2021Pathogenic; van2021Troponin).

## Interactions
TNNC2, or troponin C2, is a component of the troponin complex, which plays a critical role in muscle contraction by regulating the interaction between actin and myosin in fast skeletal muscle fibers. TNNC2 interacts with troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT) to form the troponin complex. This complex is essential for the calcium-mediated regulation of muscle contraction. Upon calcium binding, TNNC2 undergoes a conformational change that facilitates the interaction with TnI, which in turn affects the position of tropomyosin on the actin filament, allowing myosin to bind to actin and initiate contraction (van2021Pathogenic).

Pathogenic variants in TNNC2, such as D34Y and M79I, have been shown to disrupt these interactions. The D34Y variant affects the displacement of the N-terminal EF-hand of TNNC2 following calcium binding, which impedes the exposure of the hydrophobic pocket necessary for TnI switch peptide binding. The M79I variant perturbs the interaction between TnI and the N-domain of TNNC2, leading to a displacement of the TnI peptide (van2021Pathogenic). These disruptions highlight the critical nature of TNNC2's interactions within the troponin complex for proper muscle function.
