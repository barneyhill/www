# MPHOSPH6

## Overview
MPHOSPH6 is a human gene that encodes the protein M-phase phosphoprotein 6, which is primarily involved in the synthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This protein plays a critical role in the maturation of 5.8S rRNA from a 7S ribosomal precursor, a key step in ribosome biogenesis and cellular protein synthesis (Huang2020Single). MPHOSPH6 is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the recruitment of ribosomal precursors, underscoring its importance in ribosome assembly (Huang2020Single). Additionally, MPHOSPH6 is implicated in the regulation of telomere length, which is essential for maintaining chromosomal stability and cellular lifespan (Huang2020Single). The protein is phosphorylated during mitosis, suggesting a potential role in cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation (Min2009Microarray). Despite its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes, the full spectrum of MPHOSPH6's functions in normal physiological conditions remains to be fully understood, as research has predominantly focused on its roles in disease contexts or experimental settings (Li2005Discrimination).

## Structure


## Function
MPHOSPH6, or M-phase phosphoprotein 6, is a protein involved in the synthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in human cells. It plays a crucial role in the maturation of 5.8S rRNA from a 7S ribosomal precursor, a process essential for ribosome biogenesis and cellular protein synthesis (Huang2020Single). MPHOSPH6 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the recruitment of ribosomal precursors, highlighting its importance in maintaining the efficiency of ribosome assembly (Huang2020Single).

The protein is also associated with the regulation of telomere length, which is vital for chromosomal stability and cellular lifespan (Huang2020Single). MPHOSPH6 is phosphorylated during mitosis, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation, although the specific mechanisms in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature (Min2009Microarray). Despite its involvement in these critical cellular processes, the precise function of MPHOSPH6 in normal physiological conditions remains to be fully elucidated, as most studies focus on its role in disease contexts or under experimental conditions (Li2005Discrimination).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MPHOSPH6, or M-phase phosphoprotein 6, is known to interact with the RNA exosome complex, which is crucial for RNA processing and degradation. This interaction is significant as the exosome complex plays a vital role in the degradation of noncoding RNA transcripts and RNA surveillance (Milligan2008A). In yeast, the homologous protein Mpp6 has been shown to bind RNA in vitro, with a higher affinity for poly(U) sequences, suggesting a potential role in targeting RNAs to the exosome (Milligan2008A). 

In humans, MPHOSPH6 is associated with the processing of TERC, a core component of the telomerase complex, indicating its involvement in telomere maintenance (Li2020Genomewide). It is also a direct target of miR-146b-5p, a microRNA that regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally. This interaction was confirmed through 3' UTR reporter assays, which demonstrated a reduction in luciferase activity, indicating that MPHOSPH6 is subject to regulation by miR-146b-5p (Kirchmeyer2018Cytokinemediated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MPHOSPH6 in RNA metabolism and cellular processes.
