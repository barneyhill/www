# POLR1A

## Overview
POLR1A is a gene that encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I, a multi-subunit enzyme complex responsible for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in eukaryotic cells. The protein product of POLR1A, known as RPA194, plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis by synthesizing the 47S rRNA precursor, which is subsequently processed into the mature rRNAs that form the structural and functional core of ribosomes. As a key component of the RNA polymerase I complex, RPA194 is involved in the assembly and stability of the enzyme, interacting with other subunits and transcription factors to facilitate efficient rRNA synthesis. The activity of POLR1A is tightly regulated to ensure proper cellular function, and its dysregulation can lead to various diseases, including acrofacial dysostosis and neurodegenerative disorders (Kara2017Severe; Pitts2022Regulation; Weaver2015Acrofacial).

## Structure
The POLR1A gene encodes the largest subunit of human RNA polymerase I (hPol I), which is crucial for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. The primary structure of POLR1A includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with other subunits and DNA.

In terms of quaternary structure, POLR1A is part of a complex that includes a catalytic core formed by ten subunits, with RPA1 and RPA2 creating the central DNA-binding cleft (Zhao2021Structure). The hPol I structure also features a single-subunit stalk, which is more flexible compared to its yeast counterpart (Daiß2022The). Notably, the RPA1 subunit contains a novel domain called 'dock II,' which resembles a truncated HMG box and may serve as a platform for transcription factor binding (Daiß2022The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity and stability of POLR1A, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. Splice variants of POLR1A could lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization.

## Function
POLR1A encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I, known as RPA194, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus of healthy human cells. This transcription process is essential for ribosome biogenesis, as it produces the 47S rRNA precursor. This precursor is subsequently processed into mature 28S, 18S, and 5.8S rRNAs, which are integral components of ribosomes (Kara2017Severe; Pitts2022Regulation).

The activity of RNA polymerase I, and thus POLR1A, is a critical rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, which is vital for protein synthesis during cell growth, division, and differentiation. The transcription by RNA polymerase I occurs at the border of the fibrillar center and dense fibrillar component within the nucleolus, where the 47S precursor undergoes processing to form pre-40S and pre-60S ribosomal subunits. These subunits are further matured into functional ribosomes in the cytoplasm (Pitts2022Regulation).

POLR1A's function is tightly regulated by metabolic and environmental conditions, ensuring the balance of ribosome production necessary for maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions. Dysregulation of POLR1A activity can lead to diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Pitts2022Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR1A gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably acrofacial dysostosis, Cincinnati type, a disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and limb defects. This condition results from POLR1A dysfunction, which compromises ribosomal DNA transcription, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. The resulting cellular stress leads to p53-dependent cell death and reduced neural crest cell migration, causing cranioskeletal hypoplasia (Watt2018tp53dependent; Weaver2015Acrofacial).

In addition to craniofacial and limb anomalies, POLR1A mutations can lead to severe neurodegenerative diseases. A homozygous mutation in POLR1A has been linked to a novel demyelinating leukodystrophy, characterized by cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, psychomotor retardation, and ataxia. This mutation affects the stability of the RPA194 protein, disrupting RNA polymerase I activity and leading to significant neurological impairment (Kara2017Severe).

The phenotypic variability observed in individuals with POLR1A mutations suggests that different mutations can lead to varying severities of these conditions. Further research into POLR1A mutations may elucidate the specific roles of ribosome biogenesis in skeletal and neurological development (Weaver2015Acrofacial).

## Interactions
POLR1A, a subunit of RNA polymerase I, is involved in several critical interactions essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. It forms part of the core enzyme complex by interacting with other subunits such as RPA135 (POLR1B), contributing to the composite active site of the enzyme. The interaction between POLR1A and RPA135 is crucial for the enzyme's function, as mutations in POLR1A, such as the Ser934Leu substitution, can alter the conformation of the RPA194 protein, affecting its interaction with RPA135 and potentially compromising transcription activity (Kara2017Severe).

POLR1A also interacts with transcription factors that facilitate the assembly of the RNA polymerase I preinitiation complex (PIC) at rDNA promoters. TP53INP2, a protein involved in autophagy and ribosome biogenesis, interacts with components of the POLR1 PIC, including POLR1A, to promote rDNA transcription. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and assembly of the complex at rDNA promoters, highlighting the role of POLR1A in facilitating efficient rRNA synthesis (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR). These interactions underscore the importance of POLR1A in maintaining normal cellular function and its potential impact on neurodegenerative diseases when mutated.
