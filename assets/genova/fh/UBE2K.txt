# UBE2K

## Overview
UBE2K is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 K, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The enzyme is categorized as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is characterized by its ability to facilitate the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, marking proteins for proteasomal degradation. This function is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis. UBE2K is unique among E2 enzymes due to its capacity to synthesize unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are essential for the turnover of short-lived proteins. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis through its role in ubiquitination and degradation pathways (Middleton2021Identification; Haldeman1997Structure; Nakasone2022Structure).

## Structure
UBE2K, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 K, is characterized by a conserved E2 catalytic core domain essential for its function in ubiquitin chain synthesis. The protein contains a UBC domain, which is approximately 150 amino acids long and features an α/β fold with four α-helices and four β-strands (Lee2018Crystal). This domain is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, as it includes a cysteine residue in the active site that participates in ubiquitin transfer (Middleton2015The).

UBE2K also possesses a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which plays a significant role in recognizing and binding ubiquitin chains. This domain is involved in stabilizing the acceptor ubiquitin and enhancing catalysis, despite being distant from the active site (Nakasone2022Structure). The UBA domain interacts with ubiquitin primarily through hydrophobic interactions, and its binding surface area is larger when interacting with di-ubiquitin (Lee2018Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, UBE2K can form homodimers, which may influence its functional properties. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
UBE2K, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 K, plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. It specifically facilitates the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, marking proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thus maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Middleton2021Identification; Nakasone2022Structure). UBE2K is unique among E2 enzymes for its ability to synthesize unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, a process crucial for the turnover of short-lived proteins (Haldeman1997Structure).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), UBE2K modulates histone H3 levels and its trimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which is important for neurogenic potential. It promotes the degradation of histone H3, reducing H3K9me3 levels, thereby facilitating the expression of neurogenic genes during differentiation (Fatima2020The). UBE2K's activity is crucial for maintaining the unique chromatin architecture of hESCs, allowing for dynamic chromatin reorganization during development (Fatima2020The).

UBE2K is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing protein turnover and cellular homeostasis through its role in ubiquitination and degradation pathways (Nakasone2022Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the UBE2K gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In schizophrenia, elevated levels of UBE2K mRNA and protein have been observed in the blood and brain tissues of affected individuals. This suggests that UBE2K may contribute to ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction, potentially leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, a phenomenon also seen in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (Meiklejohn2019Blood).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), UBE2K is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation and enhances stemness, indicating its role in cancer progression. The regulation of UBE2K by the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP3 further underscores its significance in PDAC, as this interaction stabilizes UBE2K expression, facilitating tumor growth (Fu2023UBE2K).

UBE2K is also involved in polyglutamine diseases like Huntington's disease, where it enhances the formation of protein aggregates and contributes to neuronal cell death. This activity is linked to the ubiquitination of expanded polyglutamine proteins, which are characteristic of these disorders (de2007Ubiquitinconjugating).

## Interactions
UBE2K, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 K, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes. UBE2K interacts with ubiquitin variants (UbVs) such as UbV.k.1 and UbV.k.2, which bind to a hydrophobic cleft on UBE2K, inhibiting its interaction with the E1 enzyme and disrupting E3-catalyzed discharge (Middleton2021Identification). It also forms complexes with ubiquitin (Ub) and di-ubiquitin (Ub2), where the UBA domain of UBE2K plays a critical role in the discharging reaction of ubiquitin chain synthesis (Lee2018Crystal). 

UBE2K interacts with the E3 ligase RNF138, facilitating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of histone H3 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Fatima2020The). This interaction is significant for regulating histone modifications and gene expression, impacting neurogenic potential (Fatima2020The). UBE2K also interacts with the huntingtin protein (HTT), influencing its degradation pathways (Fatima2020The). 

Additionally, UBE2K is involved in the synthesis of K48-linked ubiquitin chains, interacting with ubiquitin in a manner that is crucial for the formation of these chains, which are important for protein degradation (Middleton2015The).
