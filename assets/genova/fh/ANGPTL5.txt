# ANGPTL5

## Overview
ANGPTL5 is a gene that encodes the angiopoietin-like 5 protein, which is a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid and triglyceride metabolism, playing a significant role in regulating triglyceride levels in the bloodstream by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase activity (Hammad2020Correlation). ANGPTL5 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and the adult human heart, indicating its importance in lipid metabolic processes (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike; Leentjens2022The). Although the specific receptor for angiopoietin-like 5 has not been identified, its elevated levels have been associated with metabolic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, where it correlates with increased triglyceride levels and insulin resistance (Alghanim2019Higher). Additionally, ANGPTL5 has been implicated in the ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting potential clinical applications in stem cell transplantation (Zhang2008Angiopoietinlike). Despite its known functions, the role of ANGPTL5 in angiogenesis remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its full range of biological activities (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike).

## Function
ANGPTL5 (angiopoietin-like 5) is a protein primarily involved in lipid and triglyceride metabolism. It is structurally similar to other members of the angiopoietin-like protein family, possessing a cleavable signal peptide in the N-terminal, a coiled-coil domain, and a fibrinogen-like domain (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike). ANGPTL5 is mainly expressed in adipose tissue and the adult human heart, suggesting its significant role in lipid metabolism (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike; Leentjens2022The).

The protein is known to inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, which is crucial for the regulation of triglyceride levels in the bloodstream (Hammad2020Correlation). Loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL5 have been associated with low plasma triglyceride levels, indicating its role in triglyceride metabolism (Romeo2008Rare). ANGPTL5's involvement in lipid metabolism is further supported by its elevated levels in conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, where it correlates with increased triglyceride levels and insulin resistance (Alghanim2019Higher).

Despite its known functions in lipid metabolism, the specific receptor for ANGPTL5 has not yet been identified, and its role in angiogenesis remains unclear (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANGPTL5 gene have been associated with various metabolic disorders. Loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL5 are linked to low plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, suggesting a role in TG metabolism. These mutations often result in impaired protein secretion, contributing to reduced TG levels in the bloodstream (Romeo2008Rare). Approximately 1% of individuals possess a sequence variant in ANGPTL5 that significantly alters protein function, impacting plasma TG levels (Romeo2008Rare).

In the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), higher plasma levels of ANGPTL5 have been observed. These elevated levels correlate with increased body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratios, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance, indicating a potential role in the metabolic disturbances associated with these conditions (Alghanim2019Higher). ANGPTL5 levels also correlate with higher triglyceride levels in subjects with T2D, but not with total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL levels, suggesting a specific involvement in triglyceride metabolism (Alghanim2019Higher).

ANGPTL5 has also been implicated in the ex vivo expansion of human cord blood hematopoietic stem cells, enhancing their engraftment capabilities, which could have clinical applications in stem cell transplantation (Zhang2008Angiopoietinlike).

## Interactions
ANGPTL5, a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, is primarily expressed in the adult human heart and has been identified to interact with the immune-inhibitory receptor LILRB2 (Santulli2014AngiopoietinLike). This interaction suggests a potential role in immune regulation and cancer, although specific details about the nature of these interactions are not extensively documented (Santulli2014AngiopoietinLike). Despite its structural similarity to other ANGPTL proteins, ANGPTL5's receptor is not yet known, and there is no published data about its role in angiogenesis or specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike). The protein is characterized by an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide, a predicted coiled-coil domain, and a fibrinogen-like domain, which are common features among ANGPTL proteins and may suggest potential interaction capabilities (Santulli2014AngiopoietinLike). However, detailed information on any physical interactions that ANGPTL5 may participate in, such as forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in activating or inhibitory interactions, is currently lacking (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike).
