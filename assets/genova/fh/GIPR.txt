# GIPR

## Overview
The GIPR gene encodes the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, a class B1 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. This receptor is primarily expressed in pancreatic α and β cells, where it mediates the incretin effect by enhancing insulin secretion in response to glucose intake. Additionally, GIPR is involved in glucagon secretion, contributing to the regulation of blood glucose levels. Beyond the pancreas, GIPR is expressed in the central nervous system, where it influences feeding behavior and energy balance. Structurally, the receptor comprises an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain with seven helices, and an intracellular domain, facilitating its interaction with the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Variants and mutations in the GIPR gene have been implicated in metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Kizilkaya2021Loss; El2021GIP; Zhao2021Structural).

## Structure
The human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) is a class B1 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in glucose regulation and fatty acid metabolism. Structurally, GIPR consists of an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) with seven helices, and an intracellular domain. The TMD features a sharp kink in TM6 and an outward movement in TM7, which are characteristic of class B1 GPCRs (Zhao2021Structural). The receptor's ligand, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), binds in a helical conformation, with its N terminus penetrating the TMD core and the C terminus interacting with the ECD and extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) (Zhao2021Structural).

The GIPR structure is stabilized by conserved residues in the lower half of the TMD pocket, which recognize common segments of GIP homologous peptides, while non-conserved residues in the upper half interact with GIP-specific residues (Zhao2021Structural). The receptor-G protein interface is similar to other class B1 receptors, indicating a common G protein signaling mechanism (Zhao2021Structural). The structural framework of GIPR provides insights into hormone recognition and receptor activation, serving as a template for designing therapeutic GIPR agonists (Zhao2021Structural).

## Function
The GIPR gene encodes the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor, which is crucial for mediating the incretin effect and maintaining glucose tolerance in healthy human cells. GIPR is expressed in both α and β cells of the pancreatic islets. In β cells, GIPR facilitates insulin secretion in response to nutrient intake, particularly glucose, by interacting with the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (El2021GIP). This interaction enhances insulin secretion, which is essential for reducing postprandial hyperglycemia (El2021GIP).

In α cells, GIPR stimulates glucagon secretion, especially in response to amino acids, which is important for maintaining glucose homeostasis. This glucagon secretion is nutrient-dependent and mimics the glucose-dependent action seen in β cells. The activity of GIPR in α cells also contributes to insulin secretion through paracrine communication between α and β cells, coordinating the secretion of both glucagon and insulin to maintain postprandial homeostasis (El2021GIP).

GIPR is also expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a role in regulating energy balance and feeding behavior. Activation of GIPR in neurons can suppress food intake, suggesting its involvement in appetite control (Samms2021GIPR). This receptor's activity in the brain may also influence the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, allowing peripheral signals to access brain regions that control appetite (Samms2021GIPR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) gene have been linked to various metabolic disorders. The R190Q and E288G variants of GIPR are associated with impaired receptor function, affecting adiposity, bone health, and cardiovascular outcomes. These variants result in reduced G protein-mediated signaling and impaired β-arrestin 2 recruitment, leading to decreased receptor internalization and altered physiological responses. Carriers of the E288G variant exhibit lower bone mineral density and a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, while both R190Q and E288G variants are linked to higher systolic blood pressure and altered lipid profiles (Kizilkaya2021Loss).

The E354Q variant of GIPR is associated with increased risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. This mutation leads to enhanced agonist-induced desensitization, impairing the receptor's ability to control insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. The E354Q variant shows exaggerated downregulation from the plasma membrane and delayed recovery of GIP sensitivity, contributing to its link with metabolic diseases (Mohammad2014A).

In GH-secreting pituitary adenomas, GIPR is aberrantly overexpressed, potentially due to epigenetic changes such as altered DNA methylation patterns. This overexpression is associated with a paradoxical increase in growth hormone after glucose intake, which may have diagnostic and prognostic significance in endocrine tumors (Dalle2023The).

## Interactions
The gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins to mediate its signaling functions. GIPR forms a complex with the G protein heterotrimer, specifically the Gs protein, which is crucial for its signaling mechanism. The Gs protein is anchored by the α5 helix of Gαs, fitting into the cytoplasmic cavity formed by transmembrane segments and intracellular loops of GIPR (Zhao2021Structural). This interaction is essential for the receptor's activation and subsequent signaling pathways.

GIPR also interacts with arrestins, although it does not effectively recruit GRK2 or arrestin3 (Arr3) in a ligand-independent manner. The receptor displays higher basal activity compared to the GLP-1 receptor but shows a substantially smaller signal window for arrestin recruitment, indicating lower maximum arrestin binding (AlSabah2014The). Despite this, overexpression of GRK2 or β-arrestin-1 can significantly repress GIP-stimulated cAMP production, suggesting that the GRK/β-arrestin paradigm regulates GIPR signaling (Tseng2000Role). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of GIPR, influencing its role in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.
