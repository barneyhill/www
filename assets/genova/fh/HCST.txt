# HCST

## Overview
The HCST gene encodes a transmembrane signaling adaptor protein known as DAP10, which is integral to the immune system's function. This protein is a key component of the immune recognition receptor complex associated with the C-type lectin-like receptor NKG2D, playing a pivotal role in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. Through its involvement in these immune pathways, the HCST protein facilitates cytotoxic activity and cytokine production, which are essential for the body's defense mechanisms against infections and tumors. The gene's expression is notably correlated with immune-related markers such as PDL1 and CD8+ T cell infiltration, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy response, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (Qi2020CSF1R).

## Structure


## Function
The HCST gene encodes a transmembrane signaling adaptor protein that is integral to the immune recognition receptor complex associated with the C-type lectin-like receptor NKG2D. This complex is crucial for the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells, playing a significant role in immune responses by promoting cytotoxic activity and cytokine production. The HCST protein is involved in important immune pathways, including natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which is essential for the body's defense against infections and tumors (Qi2020CSF1R).

HCST is also implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, as it activates NK and T cell responses, indicating its involvement in critical immune response pathways (Qi2020CSF1R). The protein's activity is positively correlated with the expression of the immune-related gene PDL1 and CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting its role in enhancing immune surveillance and potentially improving prognosis in certain cancers, such as lung squamous cell carcinoma (Qi2020CSF1R). The HCST protein's function in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer (Qi2020CSF1R).

## Clinical Significance
The HCST gene, also known as DAP10, has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting the response to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alterations in HCST expression have been linked to its role in immune-related pathways, particularly in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which are crucial for cancer immunotherapy (Qi2020CSF1R). The gene's expression is positively correlated with PDL1 and CD8+ T cell infiltration in the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in immune response pathways (Qi2020CSF1R).

High expression of HCST, along with high infiltration of CD8+ T cells, has been associated with improved prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma, although this correlation does not extend to lung adenocarcinoma (Qi2020CSF1R). While the study does not provide specific information on diseases directly caused by mutations in HCST, its role in immune cell activation and signaling suggests that alterations could impact immune responses, potentially contributing to conditions like immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorders (Qi2020CSF1R). The study emphasizes the importance of HCST in the context of NSCLC and its treatment response, highlighting its potential as a novel biomarker for immunotherapy (Qi2020CSF1R).

## Interactions
The HCST gene encodes a transmembrane signaling adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling. It is a component of the immune recognition receptor complex associated with the C-type lectin-like receptor NKG2D. This interaction is essential for the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells, facilitating immune responses against infected or transformed cells (Qi2020CSF1R). The HCST protein, also known as DAP10, is involved in natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which is a critical pathway in the immune response (Qi2020CSF1R).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HCST has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting the response to anti-PD-1 therapy. The study found a significant positive correlation between HCST and PDL1 expression in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that HCST may interact with immune-related pathways involving PDL1 (Qi2020CSF1R). Although specific interactions of HCST in NSCLC immunotherapy are not detailed, its involvement in the immune recognition receptor complex suggests interactions with other proteins involved in immune signaling pathways, particularly in relation to CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (Qi2020CSF1R).
