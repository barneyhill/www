# COMT

## Overview
The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene encodes the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase, which is a critical component of the methyltransferase family. This enzyme is responsible for the methylation of catecholamines, including neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, as well as catechol estrogens. The COMT enzyme exists in two isoforms: a soluble form (S-COMT) and a membrane-bound form (MB-COMT), with the latter being more active in the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, where it plays a significant role in dopamine regulation (Bertocci1991Human; Zhu2002CatecholOMethyltransferase). The gene's polymorphisms, notably the Val158Met variant, have been linked to various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, and pain susceptibility, underscoring its clinical significance (Lin2017Depression; Pandolfo2015Association). The enzyme's function in neurotransmitter degradation and its interactions with other proteins highlight its importance in maintaining neurotransmitter balance and its potential role in modulating pathways related to cell invasion and cancer progression (Janacova2023CatecholOmethyl; Zhu2002CatecholOMethyltransferase).

## Structure
The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme is characterized by a seven-stranded β-sheet core sandwiched between two sets of α-helices, typical of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase fold family (Rutherford2008Crystal). The primary structure of the soluble form (S-COMT) consists of 221 amino acids, while the membrane-bound form (MB-COMT) includes an additional 50 residues at the N-terminus, directing it to membranes (TENHUNEN1994Genomic; Rutherford2006The). 

The secondary structure includes π-helical and 3_10-helical structures in helices 6 and 7, due to proline residues that disrupt the helices (Rutherford2008Crystal). The tertiary structure forms a single-domain α/β structure with a conserved fold, including an elongated loop between β6 and β7, which is part of the catechol-binding site (Rutherford2006The). 

COMT exists in two main isoforms: S-COMT and MB-COMT, resulting from alternative splicing (Lundström1995Cloning). The enzyme contains several cysteine residues, some of which are exposed to the solvent and may form disulfide bonds under nonreducing conditions (Rutherford2008Crystal). The presence of a common polymorphism at residue 108, either valine or methionine, affects the enzyme's stability and activity (Rutherford2008Crystal).

## Function
The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of catecholamines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, as well as catechol estrogens and other catechols. This process involves the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to catechol substrates, which is essential for regulating the levels of these bioactive molecules and preventing their accumulation and potential cytotoxic effects (Zhu2002CatecholOMethyltransferase). 

COMT exists in two isoforms: a soluble form (S-COMT) and a membrane-bound form (MB-COMT). The soluble form is predominant in most tissues, while the membrane-bound form is more active in the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, where it plays a significant role in dopamine regulation (Bertocci1991Human; Zhu2002CatecholOMethyltransferase). 

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining neurotransmitter balance, influencing mood, cognition, and stress response. It is involved in the inactivation of catecholamine neurotransmitters, thereby reducing their neurotransmitter activity and chemical reactivity, which is important for protecting tissues from oxidative stress and potential damage (Zhu2002CatecholOMethyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders due to its role in degrading catecholamines, such as dopamine. Variations in the COMT gene, particularly the Val158Met polymorphism, have been associated with mood disorders like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD). The Val/Met158 genotype is more frequent in patients with these conditions, suggesting a genetic determinant for increased risk (Pandolfo2015Association). The Met158 allele is also linked to a higher likelihood of developing obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and major depression (Witte2012Effects).

In schizophrenia, the COMT gene's involvement is complex, with certain haplotypes showing significant associations. The Val158 allele has been linked to earlier onset and cognitive deficits related to schizophrenia, although results are mixed (Shifman2002A). The COMT gene is also associated with pain susceptibility in Parkinson's disease, where specific variants like rs4680 and rs6267 correlate with increased pain severity (Lin2017Depression).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of COMT polymorphisms in influencing susceptibility to various psychiatric and neurological conditions, highlighting the gene's potential as a target for genetic screening and therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant in the context of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. A study identified 32 'true' interaction partners of COMT, highlighting SPINT2, a protease inhibitor, as a key partner. SPINT2 is involved in MET receptor activation and signaling pathways and is known for negatively regulating hepatocyte growth factor-induced invasion in breast cancer cells (Janacova2023CatecholOmethyl). Other known interactors of COMT include RAB14, RAB5A, calnexin (CANX), and extended synaptotagmin-1 (ESYT1) (Janacova2023CatecholOmethyl).

COMT overexpression in MCF7 breast cancer cells has been shown to decrease cell invasiveness, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. This effect is partly attributed to its interaction with the MET signaling pathway, where several proteins involved in MET signaling are deregulated in COMT-overexpressing cells (Janacova2023CatecholOmethyl). The interaction between COMT and SPINT2, along with its influence on MET signaling, may contribute to the inhibition of tumorigenesis mediated by COMT (Janacova2023CatecholOmethyl). These interactions highlight COMT's potential role in modulating pathways related to cell invasion and cancer progression.
