# LCT

## Overview
The LCT gene encodes the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), a crucial β-galactosidase involved in the digestion of lactose, the primary sugar found in milk. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is located in the brush border membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine. Lactase facilitates the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose, which are then absorbed and utilized by the body. The expression of the LCT gene and the activity of lactase are subject to genetic regulation, with variations leading to conditions such as lactase persistence or non-persistence, the latter being associated with lactose intolerance. Mutations in the LCT gene can result in congenital lactase deficiency, a severe condition manifesting from birth. The regulation of LCT involves complex interactions with transcription factors and is influenced by polymorphisms that affect its expression (AnguitaRuiz2020Genetics; Diekmann2015Congenital; Hollox1999Common).

## Structure


## Function
The LCT gene encodes the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), which is essential for the digestion of lactose, the primary carbohydrate in milk. This enzyme is a β-galactosidase located in the brush border membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, specifically in the apical part of microvilli (AnguitaRuiz2020Genetics). Lactase catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose into its component monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, which are then absorbed by enterocytes and used as energy or structural elements (AnguitaRuiz2020Genetics). 

Lactase activity is crucial during infancy, allowing for the efficient digestion of milk, a primary food source at this stage. In most mammals, including humans, lactase activity declines after weaning, a condition known as lactase non-persistence (LNP). However, some individuals maintain high levels of lactase activity into adulthood, a trait known as lactase persistence (LP) (AnguitaRuiz2020Genetics). The enzyme's activity is necessary for the proper digestion of lactose, and its deficiency can lead to lactose intolerance, characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms when lactose is consumed (Kowalówka2023A). The expression of lactase is tightly regulated along the proximal to distal axis of the small intestine, with high levels in the mid-intestine and reduced levels in the duodenum and distal ileum (AnguitaRuiz2020Genetics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LCT gene, which encodes the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), are responsible for congenital lactase deficiency (CLD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a complete lack of lactase activity from birth, leading to severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea, dehydration, and malnutrition in infants consuming lactose-containing milk (Diekmann2015Congenital; Amiri2015The; Babcock2022The). CLD is caused by various mutations, including nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, which affect the protein's folding, trafficking, and enzymatic function (Torniainen2009Four; Wanes2019Congenital).

Specific mutations such as Y1473X and D1796fs result in truncated proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and lack lactase activity, contributing to the loss of function (Diekmann2015Congenital). Other mutations, like G1363S, lead to misfolding and transport incompetence of LPH, with potential for chaperone-based therapies due to its temperature-sensitive phenotype (Wanes2019Congenital; Babcock2022The).

In addition to congenital forms, primary lactose intolerance is linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LCT gene, such as 13910C>T and 22018G>A, which affect lactase expression and lead to a gradual decrease in lactase activity over time (T; TomczonekMoruś201913910C&gt).

## Interactions
The human lactase gene (LCT) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that regulate its expression. Polymorphisms in the region upstream of the LCT gene affect DNA-protein interactions, particularly at position -958, where a C to T transition significantly reduces protein binding activity. This polymorphism influences the binding of nuclear proteins, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using Caco2 cell extracts (Hollox1999Common).

The lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) promoter, which is relevant to LCT, is activated through interactions between transcription factors such as GATA-5 and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF-1α). These factors physically associate to synergistically activate the LPH promoter, with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-5 and the homeodomain of HNF-1α being crucial for this interaction (van2002Physical). Additionally, Cdx2 and HNF1α also interact to mediate LPH gene expression, with Cdx2 binding to specific cis elements in the LPH promoter and synergistically activating transcription when co-transfected with HNF1α (MITCHELMORE2000Interaction). These interactions are essential for the tissue-specific expression of LPH, particularly in the small intestine.
