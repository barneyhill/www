# PCBP1

## Overview
PCBP1, or poly(rC) binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, is characterized by its three K-homology (KH) domains, which facilitate interactions with nucleic acids. These domains enable PCBP1 to participate in mRNA stabilization, translational regulation, and transcriptional activation. Additionally, PCBP1 plays a significant role in iron metabolism and cellular responses to oxygen levels. It is widely expressed across different tissues and is implicated in several biological processes, including pre-mRNA splicing and protein synthesis. The gene's expression and function are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and cellular localization. PCBP1's involvement in various pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease contexts, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Lu2023PCBP1; Meng2007Signalingdependent; Nazarov2019KHDomain).

## Structure
PCBP1, or poly(rC) binding protein 1, is characterized by its three K-homology (KH) domains, which are crucial for its RNA-binding function. These domains are arranged sequentially, with KH1 located at the N-terminus, followed by KH2, and KH3 at the C-terminus (Wagener2015The; Zhang2020Multilevel). The KH domains are composed of three antiparallel α-helices and three β-folds, forming a structure that facilitates nucleic acid interactions (MAKEYEV2002The; Zhang2020Multilevel). PCBP1 contains two nuclear localization signals (NLS), with NLSI situated between KH2 and KH3, and NLSII within the KH3 domain, which are responsible for its transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Wagener2015The; Zhang2020Multilevel).

PCBP1 is an intronless gene, likely originating from a retrotransposition event, and is widely expressed across various tissues (MAKEYEV2002The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Meng2007Signalingdependent; MAKEYEV2002The). These structural features and modifications enable PCBP1 to participate in diverse biological processes, including transcriptional regulation, translational control, and pre-mRNA splicing (Wagener2015The).

## Function
PCBP1 (poly(rC) binding protein 1) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is involved in mRNA stabilization and translation regulation by binding to pyrimidine-rich sequences in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR) of target mRNAs, such as α-globin and POLH, thereby influencing their stability and expression (Ren2014DNA; Nazarov2019KHDomain). PCBP1 also acts as a transcriptional activator, particularly for the eIF4E gene, and its activity is modulated by phosphorylation through Pak1 signaling, which affects its nuclear localization and function (Meng2007Signalingdependent).

In addition to its role in mRNA processing, PCBP1 is involved in iron metabolism, serving as an iron chaperone that delivers iron to enzymes and storage proteins, which is essential for processes like heme synthesis (Nazarov2019KHDomain). It also participates in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF1α) and is necessary for the activity of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, impacting cellular responses to oxygen levels and protein synthesis (Nazarov2019KHDomain).

PCBP1's ability to interact with nucleic acids and proteins allows it to function in transcription regulation, splicing, and translation, making it a versatile regulator of gene expression in response to cellular signals (Choi2009Poly(C; Meng2007Signalingdependent)binding page 1 of 2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PCBP1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In congenital heart diseases, PCBP1 is crucial for heart development, particularly in regulating alternative splicing of AARS2. A specific nonsense variant, c.550C>T, is associated with conditions such as global developmental delay, Tetralogy of Fallot, and decreased muscle mass, indicating its role in congenital cardiomyopathy (Lu2023PCBP1).

In cancer, PCBP1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is linked to increased tumorigenicity in several cancers, including prostate, colon, gastric, and thyroid cancers. High PCBP1 expression correlates with better outcomes in lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, while its knockdown can enhance metastatic potential in breast epithelial cells (Guo2018Splicing). PCBP1 mutations are recurrent in Burkitt lymphoma, affecting the KHIII domain and nuclear localization signals, which may impact its RNA binding capabilities and contribute to lymphomagenesis (Wagener2015The).

PCBP1 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases by regulating translational control and mRNA stabilization. Alterations in PCBP1 expression or interactions can affect protein expression levels, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Geuens2017Mutant). These findings underscore the importance of PCBP1 in various disease contexts, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PCBP1 (poly(rC) binding protein 1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to single-stranded nucleic acids, particularly poly(C) sequences, and is involved in mRNA stabilization and translational regulation. PCBP1 interacts with nuclear actin within the hnRNP complex, which is crucial for mRNA processing and transport (Huo2008Identification). It also forms part of multiprotein complexes, such as the differentiation control element (DICE) at the 3′-UTR of r15-LOX mRNA, preventing 80S ribosome formation and causing mRNA translational silencing (Huo2008Identification).

PCBP1 interacts with Caper α, a U2 snRNP auxiliary factor-related protein, which is essential for its splicing-promoting activity (Meng2007Signalingdependent). It is phosphorylated by P21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), which modulates its role in transcription and translation (Meng2007Signalingdependent). PCBP1 also binds to Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a core member of the RNA-induced silencing complex, indicating its involvement in the miRNA pathway (EspinozaLewis2017Poly(C)binding page 1 of 5).

In the context of viral interactions, PCBP1 binds to the nonstructural protein 1β (nsp1β) of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, supporting viral replication and transcription (Beura2011Cellular). These interactions highlight PCBP1's multifunctional nature and its critical role in regulating gene expression and RNA processing.
