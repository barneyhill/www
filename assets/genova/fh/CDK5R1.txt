# CDK5R1

## Overview
The CDK5R1 gene encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1, commonly referred to as p35, which is a critical regulatory protein for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). This protein is primarily involved in the central nervous system, where it plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and function. As a regulatory subunit, p35 binds to CDK5, facilitating its kinase activity, which is essential for processes such as neuron migration, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The CDK5-p35 complex is integral to the proper development of the mammalian cortex and is involved in synaptic vesicle cycle regulation, influencing cognitive functions and behavior. Dysregulation of CDK5R1 expression or function has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Moncini2016The; Lintas2018An; Moncini2015Functional).

## Structure
The CDK5R1 gene encodes the p35 protein, a regulatory subunit crucial for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). The primary structure of p35 includes a specific amino acid sequence that is essential for its function as a CDK5 activator. The secondary structure of p35 is not detailed in the available context, but it is known to contain a proline-rich region, which is conserved among mammals and likely serves as a linker between functional domains (Venturin2006Mutations).

The tertiary structure of p35 involves its 3D folding, which is critical for its interaction with CDK5, although specific details are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure of p35 is characterized by its interaction with CDK5, forming a complex that is essential for neuronal functions (Pao2021Three).

p35 undergoes post-translational modifications, including myristoylation, which is important for membrane localization and function. This modification occurs at the N-terminal glycine residue and is crucial for the protein's stability and interaction with membranes (Pao2021Three). The context does not provide information on specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms of p35.

## Function
The CDK5R1 gene encodes the protein p35, which is the primary activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a crucial enzyme for neuronal function. In healthy human cells, the CDK5-p35 complex plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS). It is involved in various physiological processes, including neuron maintenance, migration, cytoskeletal dynamics, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (Moncini2016The; Moncini2015Functional).

The CDK5-p35 complex is essential for the proper radial migration of neurons during the development of the mammalian cortex. Mice lacking Cdk5 or p35 exhibit severe defects in neuron migration and positioning, as well as axonal fiber tract formation (Moncini2016The). The complex also regulates components of the synaptic vesicle cycle, influencing synaptic plasticity, behavior, and cognition (Moncini2015Functional).

In terms of molecular activity, p35 is a short-lived protein that activates CDK5 by binding to it. This activation is crucial for maintaining proper CDK5 activity, which is necessary for neuronal migration, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (Moncini2011The). The regulation of CDK5R1 expression is critical, as misregulation can lead to deleterious effects on CNS function (Moncini2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDK5R1 gene, which encodes the p35 protein, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In non-syndromic intellectual disability (NS-ID), mutations in CDK5R1, such as the p.A108V mutation, affect the cleavage of p35 by calpain, potentially impacting CDK5 kinase activation and contributing to cognitive dysfunction (Moncini2015Functional). The gene's 3′-UTR variants can also alter post-transcriptional regulation, affecting gene expression levels and increasing the risk for NS-ID (Moncini2015Functional).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dysregulation of the miR-15/107 family of microRNAs, which regulate CDK5R1 expression, leads to increased levels of CDK5R1 mRNA and p35, resulting in enhanced CDK5 activity. This hyperactivation is associated with the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau, a hallmark of AD pathology (Moncini2016The; Moncini2011The).

CDK5R1 has also been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through a de novo deletion at chromosome 17q11.2, which includes the entire CDK5R1 gene. This deletion results in reduced CDK5R1 transcript levels and is associated with social skill deficits and anxiety in affected individuals (Lintas2018An).

## Interactions
CDK5R1, also known as p35, is a regulatory subunit that interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) to activate its kinase activity, which is crucial for neuronal development and function. CDK5R1 interacts with CDK5 to form a complex essential for various cellular processes, including neuron maintenance, migration, and synaptic function (Zeng2018CDK5; Moncini2015Functional). 

In neurons, CDK5R1 can be cleaved by the calcium-dependent protease calpain to form p25, which has an enhanced capacity to activate CDK5 (mohamud2015role; Moncini2015Functional). This cleavage is significant for memory formation and synaptic plasticity (Moncini2015Functional). 

CDK5R1 also interacts with various E3 ligases, including PJA2, which regulates its levels through ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial in pancreatic β-cells, where PJA2-mediated ubiquitination of p35 affects insulin secretion by modulating the activity of the CDK5 complex (mohamud2015role). 

Additionally, CDK5R1 is involved in post-transcriptional regulation through interactions with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, such as nELAV, hnRNPA2/B1, and miR-103/107, which influence its expression levels (Moncini2015Functional).
