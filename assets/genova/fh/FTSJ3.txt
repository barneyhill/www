# FTSJ3

## Overview
FTSJ3 is a gene that encodes the FtsJ RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase 3, a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. This protein is characterized by its RNA-methyl-transferase domain, which is crucial for its role in the methylation of RNA molecules, and a Spb1_C domain that facilitates interactions within preribosome complexes (Simabuco2012Proteomic; Morello2011The). FtsJ RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase 3 is integral to the maturation of 18S rRNA and the formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, processes essential for normal cellular function and proliferation (Morello2011The). The protein's interactions with other nucleolar proteins, such as NIP7, and its involvement in the miRNA machinery highlight its multifaceted role in cellular RNA dynamics (Morello2011The; Ringeard2019FTSJ3).

## Structure
The FTSJ3 protein is characterized by several distinct domains and structural features. It contains a putative RNA-methyl-transferase domain (FtsJ) located in the N-terminal region, spanning residues 22 to 202, which is involved in RNA methylation (Simabuco2012Proteomic; Morello2011The). This domain includes a conserved catalytic KDKE motif typical of 2'-O-methyltransferases, which is essential for its methylation activity (Ringeard2019FTSJ3).

The central region of FTSJ3 contains a conserved uncharacterized domain, DUF3381, from residues 226 to 407, and the C-terminal region includes the Spb1_C domain from residues 640 to 828 (Simabuco2012Proteomic). The Spb1_C domain is intrinsically disordered, providing flexibility and the potential for diverse interactions, particularly in mediating macromolecular interactions within preribosome complexes (Simabuco2012Proteomic; Morello2011The).

FTSJ3 is also involved in interactions with various proteins, including ribosomal subunit proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, indicating its role in ribosome biogenesis (Simabuco2012Proteomic). The protein's interaction with NIP7 is RNA-mediated, highlighting its involvement in pre-rRNA processing (Morello2011The). The Spb1_C domain may also contain a putative nuclear localization signal, contributing to its nucleolar localization (Morello2011The).

## Function
The FTSJ3 gene encodes a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the processing of pre-rRNA intermediates crucial for the maturation of 18S rRNA and the formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Simabuco2012Proteomic; Morello2011The). FTSJ3 interacts with NIP7, and this interaction is essential for its function in ribosome biogenesis, as both proteins are involved in distinct steps of pre-rRNA processing (Morello2011The). The interaction between FTSJ3 and NIP7 is RNA-dependent, indicating that RNA molecules mediate their association (Morello2011The).

FTSJ3 contains a putative RNA-methyl-transferase domain and a Spb1_C domain, suggesting it may function as an RNA-binding protein (Morello2011The). It is involved in the early stages of rRNA processing, which is crucial for the production of functional ribosomes in healthy human cells (Morello2011The). Knockdown experiments have shown that depletion of FTSJ3 leads to the accumulation of 34S pre-rRNA, indicating inhibited processing at specific sites, which affects cell proliferation (Morello2011The). FTSJ3's role in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly is critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and proliferation (Morello2011The).

## Interactions
FTSJ3, a human protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. It interacts with NIP7, a nucleolar protein, through its C-terminal region, and this interaction is mediated by RNA molecules. The interaction is abolished by RNase A treatment, indicating RNA dependency (Morello2011The). FTSJ3 also forms part of preribosomal complexes, interacting with numerous proteins, including 21 from the 40S ribosomal subunit and 33 from the 60S subunit, as well as 44 nonribosomal proteins (Simabuco2012Proteomic).

FTSJ3 is associated with nucleophosmin (NPM), hnRNPQ, and arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), as confirmed by immunoblotting (Simabuco2012Proteomic). It also interacts with the TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) to form a complex involved in the miRNA machinery and HIV RNA processing. This interaction is crucial for the methylation of HIV RNA, allowing the virus to evade immune detection (Ringeard2019FTSJ3). The FTSJ3/TRBP complex specifically retains both TAR and genomic HIV-1 RNA, suggesting a role in RNA processing or stability (Ringeard2019FTSJ3).
