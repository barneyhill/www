# OR4F5

## Overview
The OR4F5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 5, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules. As a transmembrane receptor, OR4F5 is located in the olfactory epithelium and plays a pivotal role in the initial steps of olfactory signal transduction. Upon binding to specific odorants, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that activates an associated G-protein, initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the perception of smell. The OR4F5 gene is part of a large and diverse family of olfactory receptor genes, which are crucial for the detection and discrimination of a wide array of odorants, contributing to the complexity of olfactory perception in humans (Peng2017Integrated; Romdhane2021A).

## Structure


## Function
The OR4F5 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, which initiates a signal transduction pathway leading to the perception of smell. OR4F5 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in olfactory signal recognition and transduction. The protein functions by binding specific odorant molecules in the nasal cavity, which triggers a conformational change in the receptor. This change activates an associated G-protein, leading to a cascade of intracellular events that result in the generation of a nerve impulse. This impulse is then transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted as a distinct smell. The olfactory receptors, including OR4F5, are essential for the sense of smell, which is important for various behaviors and physiological responses, such as detecting food, environmental hazards, and pheromones. The OR4F5 gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which collectively contribute to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception in humans (Peng2017Integrated; Romdhane2021A).
