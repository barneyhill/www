# SMIM22

## Overview
SMIM22, or small integral membrane protein 22, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in cancer biology. The protein product of SMIM22 is implicated in the regulation of cell metabolism and proliferation, with significant roles in breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and prostate cancer. In breast cancer, SMIM22 interacts with metabolic enzymes to influence cell growth, while in NSCLC, it is involved in pathways that enhance glycolysis and cell proliferation. The gene's expression levels have been associated with cancer prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment outcomes (Zhao2024M2; Ye2020Emerging; Li2019Identification). Additionally, SMIM22 has been identified in studies related to kidney health, suggesting broader physiological roles beyond oncology (Acoba2024Kidney).

## Clinical Significance
SMIM22, also known as small integral membrane protein 22, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In prostate cancer, SMIM22 is part of a six-gene signature that can predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Higher expression of SMIM22 is associated with a lower risk of BCR, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2019Identification). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SMIM22 is overexpressed and contributes to cancer progression by promoting glycolysis and cell proliferation. It interacts with GALE, enhancing these processes, which are crucial for tumor growth (Zhao2024M2). The study also highlights the role of lncRNA NORAD in regulating SMIM22 expression through the miR-520g-3p axis, further influencing NSCLC progression (Zhao2024M2).

In breast cancer, SMIM22, previously misclassified as a lncRNA, is upregulated in hormone receptor-positive cases. Its knockdown results in cell cycle arrest and reduced proliferation, indicating its role in cancer cell growth and motility (Ye2020Emerging). Although its involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is less clear, SMIM22 is overexpressed in cancer stem cell-like subpopulations, suggesting a potential role in maintaining tumorigenicity (Seyama2023Identification).

## Interactions
SMIM22, also known as CASIMO1, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids that influence cancer progression. In breast cancer, SMIM22 interacts with squalene epoxidase (SQLE), a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, to regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cell metabolism equilibrium and promoting cancer cell proliferation (Ye2020Emerging).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SMIM22 interacts with the protein GALE, as evidenced by co-localization in the nucleus and confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is associated with enhanced glycolysis and cell proliferation (Zhao2024M2). The regulatory role of SMIM22 in NSCLC is further influenced by the lncRNA NORAD, which modulates SMIM22 expression through the miR-520g-3p axis. This axis is part of a pathway that promotes NSCLC progression by enhancing glycolysis and inhibiting apoptosis (Zhao2024M2).

SMIM22 is also identified as a pathway-orphan gene in kidney health studies, suggesting potential roles in cytoskeletal organization and glucose transport, although specific interactions in this context remain unexplored (Acoba2024Kidney).
