# LILRB3

## Overview
LILRB3, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The protein, also known as ILT5, CD85a, or LIR3, is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. It functions as an inhibitory receptor, characterized by its four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). These motifs are essential for recruiting phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2, which mediate the receptor's role in dampening immune cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Yeboah2020LILRB3; Huang2023LILRB3). LILRB3's interactions with ligands such as galectin-4 and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its significance in modulating immune responses, with implications in conditions like autoimmunity, cancer, and infectious diseases (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Huang2023LILRB3).

## Structure
LILRB3, also known as ILT5, CD85a, or LIR3, is a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family. It is characterized by its four extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, which are involved in ligand binding (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Yeboah2020LILRB3). The protein's cytoplasmic tail contains four immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its inhibitory signaling function (Yeboah2020LILRB3). These ITIM motifs recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHIP-1, contributing to the negative regulation of immune responses (Huang2023LILRB3).

LILRB3 is located on human chromosome 19q13.4 and exhibits significant allelic and copy number variation, reflecting its genetic diversity (Hirayasu2021Characterization). The protein shares high sequence homology with LILRA6, particularly in its extracellular domains, which can lead to cross-reactivity in antibody binding (Yeboah2020LILRB3). The extracellular domain of LILRB3 is crucial for its interaction with ligands such as galectin-4, which activates the receptor in a site-specific manner (Huang2023LILRB3). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. However, specific details on these modifications and isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
LILRB3, also known as ILT5, CD85a, and LIR3, is an inhibitory receptor expressed on myeloid cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, and basophils. It contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that play a crucial role in immune regulation by recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 upon activation. This recruitment leads to the dephosphorylation of signaling molecules, thereby inhibiting immune cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Palvair2024The; Huang2023LILRB3).

In healthy human cells, LILRB3 is involved in the negative regulation of immune responses, preventing excessive immune activation and contributing to immune tolerance. It is suggested to inhibit allergic inflammation and autoimmunity, acting as a checkpoint in immune regulation (Huang2023LILRB3). LILRB3 may also modulate the maturation and early activation of neutrophils, as its cross-linking suppresses Fc receptor-mediated degranulation, phagocytosis, and microbial killing (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

The receptor is released in a soluble form upon neutrophil activation, although the mechanism is not fully understood. This soluble form may have additional regulatory functions, potentially interacting with novel ligands (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

## Clinical Significance
LILRB3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune regulation. A genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11666543, in the LILRB3 region as a genetic susceptibility locus for Takayasu's arteritis in Turkish and North American cohorts. The risk allele is associated with a significant reduction in LILRB3 expression, suggesting that inadequate inhibitory signaling may lead to an uncontrolled immune response (Hirayasu2015Functional).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LILRB3 expression is significantly increased in certain immune cell types, such as CD14+CD16- monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages, compared to healthy individuals. This elevated expression is thought to contribute to the immunosuppressive environment of HCC, potentially impacting prognosis and immune response (Fan2021Expression).

LILRB3 expression is also upregulated in lepromatous leprosy lesions, which is associated with a Th2 cytokine response and reduced antimicrobial activity. This suggests that LILRB3 may play a role in the pathogenesis of lepromatous leprosy by influencing immune responses (Trowsdale2015Surveillance).

The high polymorphism of LILRB3 may lead to alloantibody production in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, potentially contributing to the graft-versus-leukemia effect against LILRB3-expressing leukemic cells (Hirayasu2015Functional).

## Interactions
LILRB3, a leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, participates in various interactions with other proteins that modulate immune responses. It is known to interact with galectin-4, which activates LILRB3 through site-specific binding. This interaction induces tyrosine phosphorylation of LILRB3, leading to downstream signaling involving SHP1 and SHP2, which are phosphatases that play roles in immune regulation (Huang2023LILRB3). The binding affinity of galectin-4 for LILRB3 has been measured, with a dissociation constant of 44 nmol/L, indicating a strong interaction (Huang2023LILRB3).

LILRB3 is also involved in interactions with other proteins such as SHP1, SHP2, and Lyn, which are part of its signaling pathway. These interactions are crucial for its role in immunosuppressive activity, particularly in the context of tumor development (Huang2023LILRB3). Additionally, LILRB3 has been shown to interact with cytokeratin-associated proteins, suggesting a potential role in modulating immune responses to necrotic cells (Yeboah2020LILRB3).

These interactions highlight LILRB3's role as an inhibitory receptor that can modulate immune cell activation and contribute to immune tolerance, particularly in myeloid cells (Huang2023LILRB3).
