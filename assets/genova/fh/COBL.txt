# COBL

## Overview
The COBL gene encodes the cordon-bleu WH2 repeat protein, a pivotal actin nucleation factor involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is characterized by its ability to promote the formation of non-bundled, unbranched actin filaments, which are essential for cellular morphogenesis and the development of dendritic arbors in neurons (Schwintzer2011The; Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu). The cordon-bleu protein contains multiple WH2 domains that facilitate actin binding and filament assembly, functioning independently of the Arp2/3 complex (Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu). It is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal morphology by enhancing neurite induction and branching (Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu). The protein's activity is modulated by calcium and calmodulin, which are vital for its role in dendritogenesis (Hou2015The). Additionally, COBL interacts with syndapin proteins, which recruit it to cellular membranes, further influencing actin nucleation and cellular morphology (Schwintzer2011The). Through these interactions and functions, COBL significantly contributes to the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cell shape and motility.

## Structure
The COBL protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in actin nucleation and cellular morphogenesis. It contains three C-terminal WH2 domains, which are essential for actin binding and the formation of non-bundled, unbranched filaments (Schwintzer2011The). These WH2 domains are crucial for actin filament formation, particularly in dendritic protrusion initiation (Hou2015The). The presence of a linker region, L2, between the second and third WH2 domains is important for COBL-mediated actin nucleation (Schwintzer2011The).

The N-terminal region of COBL, known as the COBL homology domain, interacts with syndapin proteins through the SH3 domain of syndapin, facilitating COBL's recruitment to membranes (Schwintzer2011The). This interaction is critical for COBL's role in neuromorphogenesis (Schwintzer2011The). COBL also contains proline-rich domains (PRDs) and an ubiquitin-like fold domain (UblD) (Schwintzer2011The).

COBL's function is modulated by calcium and calmodulin (CaM), with CaM binding being crucial for its activity in dendritic branching (Hou2015The). The protein is expressed as a full-length variant in skeletal muscle, with no shorter alternative cDNAs identified (Cracknell2020Proteomic). The molecular mechanisms and structural details of COBL, such as its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, are still being elucidated.

## Function
The COBL gene encodes the Cordon-Bleu protein, which plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization. In healthy human cells, COBL functions as an actin nucleation factor, promoting the formation of non-bundled, unbranched actin filaments. This activity is crucial for cellular morphogenesis, particularly in the development of dendritic arbors in neurons (Schwintzer2011The; Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu). COBL utilizes three C-terminal WH2 domains to bind actin, facilitating the assembly of actin filaments from their barbed ends, independent of the Arp2/3 complex (Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu).

COBL is highly expressed in the brain, where it influences neuronal morphology by increasing neurite induction and branching. Its activity is essential for dendritic branching and the formation of neuronal networks (Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu; Hou2015The). The protein's function is regulated by calcium and calmodulin, which are critical for its role in dendritogenesis (Hou2015The). COBL also interacts with syndapin I, which recruits it to membranes, further influencing actin nucleation and cellular morphology (Schwintzer2011The). Through these mechanisms, COBL contributes to the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cell shape and motility.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COBL gene have been associated with several health conditions. In the context of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction in children, higher expression of COBL in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) is linked to a metabolically beneficial state, characterized by lower body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI SDS) and decreased adipose tissue inflammation. Conversely, decreased COBL expression is associated with overweight and obesity in children, suggesting its role in metabolic health (Abdul2023COBL).

In the realm of neurological conditions, COBL has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, particularly in African American populations. A genome-wide association study identified a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of the COBL gene, suggesting a potential genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease in this demographic (Mez2016Two).

COBL is also involved in the repair of dendritic arbor defects following ischemic stroke. In mice lacking COBL, the regrowth of dendritic arbors is severely impaired, indicating its critical role in post-stroke neuronal recovery (Ji2021Poststroke). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of COBL in metabolic, neurological, and recovery processes.

## Interactions
The COBL (cordon-bleu WH2 repeat protein) gene encodes a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization. COBL interacts with syndapin proteins, specifically syndapin I and II, forming complexes in vivo. This interaction is crucial for COBL's recruitment to membranes and is mediated by the SH3 domain of syndapin I, which binds to the Cobl homology domain of COBL. This interaction is essential for dendritogenesis and neuromorphogenesis, as syndapin I recruits COBL to the cell cortex, facilitating actin filament formation (Schwintzer2011The).

COBL also interacts with the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 and the Arp2/3 complex activator N-WASP, suggesting a role in actin nucleation independent of the Arp2/3 complex. These interactions are important for COBL's function in actin filament assembly and cellular morphology (Schwintzer2011The; Ahuja2007Cordon-Bleu).

In epithelial cells, COBL is localized at the basal region of microvilli, where it interacts with BAR-containing proteins such as SNX9, PACSIN 2/syndapin 2, and ASAP1. These interactions are mediated by the COBL domain and are important for the regulation of microvillar length (Wayt2014Cordon).
