# NAPB

## Overview
The NAPB gene encodes the NSF attachment protein beta, a critical component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release in neurons. This protein functions as a co-factor for the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) ATPase, facilitating the disassembly of SNARE complexes, which is essential for the recycling of SNARE proteins and the maintenance of synaptic transmission (Zhao2021A; Ali2024Characterization). Primarily expressed in the brain, NSF attachment protein beta plays a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal signaling, impacting processes such as synaptic vesicle fusion and priming (AbdelAleem2023Cohen). Mutations in the NAPB gene have been associated with neurological disorders, including early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and autism spectrum disorders, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment and synaptic function (Zhao2021A; Ali2024Characterization).

## Function
The NAPB gene encodes the NSF attachment protein beta, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release in neurons. NAPB functions as a co-factor for the NSF ATPase, facilitating the disassembly of SNARE complexes after synaptic vesicle fusion. This disassembly is essential for recycling SNARE proteins, allowing for repeated cycles of vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release, which are vital for efficient synaptic transmission and neural communication (Zhao2021A; Ali2024Characterization).

NAPB is primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in maintaining synaptic function and neuronal signaling. It is involved in the fusion and priming of synaptic vesicles, processes that are critical for normal synaptic transmission in healthy human cells (AbdelAleem2023Cohen). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at synaptic junctions, impacting cellular communication and the overall function of the nervous system (Ali2024Characterization).

Mutations in the NAPB gene can lead to a loss of function, resulting in neurological disorders such as early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopment and synaptic function (Zhao2021A; Ali2024Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAPB gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) and autism spectrum disorders. A novel splicing mutation, c.433-1G>A, has been associated with EOEE, profound intellectual disability, and global developmental delay. This mutation was identified in a family where the affected individuals were homozygous for the variant, inherited from unaffected parents. The NAPB gene plays a crucial role in vesicular transport and neurotransmitter release, and its dysfunction is implicated in these severe neurological conditions (Zhao2021A).

Another study identified a loss-of-function mutation, c.354+2T>G, in monozygotic triplets with epilepsy and autism. This splice site loss variant leads to exon skipping and a truncated NAPB protein, resulting in a complete absence of functional protein. The mutation was inherited from consanguineous parents and was shown to affect synaptic vesicle recycling, a critical process in neuronal function (Ali2024Characterization).

These findings underscore the importance of NAPB in maintaining normal neurological function and suggest that mutations in this gene can lead to significant neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential role in conditions like epilepsy and autism (AbdelAleem2023Cohen; Ali2024Characterization).

## Interactions
NAPB (NSF attachment protein beta) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily related to its role in vesicular transport and synaptic function. It is a component of the SNARE complex, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. NAPB interacts with NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) to facilitate the disassembly of SNARE complexes, a process essential for membrane fusion events and neurotransmitter release (Wang2011Genes).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, NAPB is part of the phosphorylated tau (pTau) interactome. It interacts with pTau and is involved in phagosome maturation, a process enriched in the pTau interactome. This interaction suggests a potential role in the disease's progression, as NAPB is among the proteins found in neurofibrillary tangles, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's pathology (Drummond2020Phosphorylated).

NAPB is also identified as a hub gene in glioblastoma multiforme, where its expression levels are lower in higher WHO grades of the disease. This suggests a potential involvement in synaptic function and neuronic development, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Li2021Identification).
