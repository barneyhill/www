# ABCB4

## Overview
The ABCB4 gene encodes the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4) protein, also known as MDR3, which is a critical component of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane lipid floppase, specifically facilitating the translocation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. The proper functioning of ABCB4 is essential for bile formation, as it enables the incorporation of PC into bile salt micelles, thereby protecting the hepatobiliary system from the detergent-like effects of bile salts (Oude2006Function; Prescher2019ABCB4MDR3). Structurally, ABCB4 comprises two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, which are integral to its role in substrate binding and ATP-driven transport (Degiorgio2007Molecular; Andress2017ABCB4). Mutations in the ABCB4 gene can lead to various liver diseases, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining liver function and bile composition (Gautherot2014Phosphorylation; Andress2017ABCB4).

## Structure
The ABCB4 protein, also known as MDR3, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. It is composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), each TMD containing six transmembrane alpha-helices. These domains are crucial for substrate binding and translocation, while the NBDs couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport (Degiorgio2007Molecular; Andress2017ABCB4). The protein's structure is organized into two repeats, each approximately 610 amino acids long, connected by a 60-residue linker region (Degiorgio2007Molecular).

The ABCB4 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its phosphatidylcholine (PC) secretion activity. Specific phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain, such as Thr34, Thr44, and Ser49, are implicated in this regulatory process (Gautherot2014Phosphorylation). Mutations in these sites can affect the protein's function and processing, as seen in certain liver diseases (Gautherot2014Phosphorylation).

The tertiary structure of ABCB4 has been modeled by homology with the bacterial ABC transporter Sav1866, allowing for the mapping of mutated residues and providing insights into its structural implications (Degiorgio2007Molecular). The protein's structure is further characterized by its ability to transition between different conformational states, which are modeled based on crystallographic studies of related ABC transporters (Andress2017ABCB4).

## Function
The ABCB4 gene encodes a protein known as MDR3, which functions as a phosphatidylcholine (PC) translocator at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. This protein plays a critical role in bile formation by translocating PC from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane, allowing it to be incorporated into bile salt micelles. These mixed micelles are essential for solubilizing cholesterol and protecting the hepatobiliary system from the detergent-like activity of bile salts (Oude2006Function; Prescher2019ABCB4MDR3).

ABCB4 operates as a lipid floppase, facilitating the movement of PC lipids across the cell membrane, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the biliary tree and preventing liver diseases such as cholestasis (Sticova2020ABCB4; Andress2017ABCB4). The protein's activity is regulated by bile salts and nuclear hormone receptors, such as FXR, which modulate its expression (Oude2006Function).

Mutations in the ABCB4 gene can impair its function, leading to reduced PC secretion and associated liver pathologies, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal liver function and bile composition (Gautherot2014Phosphorylation; Andress2017ABCB4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCB4 gene, also known as ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4, are linked to several liver-related diseases. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a severe autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic mutations in ABCB4. It typically manifests in early childhood with symptoms such as jaundice, pruritus, hepatosplenomegaly, and growth retardation. Laboratory findings include elevated serum γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and decreased biliary phospholipid levels (Oude2006Function; Sticova2020ABCB4).

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is another condition associated with ABCB4 mutations, occurring during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. It is characterized by pruritus and elevated bile salt levels, with more than 10% of affected women harboring a mutated allele in ABCB4 (Ziol2008ABCB4; Stättermayer2020Variants).

Low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) syndrome is linked to heterozygous mutations in ABCB4, leading to intrahepatic cholesterol gallstones and recurring gallstones (Ziol2008ABCB4; Oude2006Function).

ABCB4 mutations are also implicated in parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), hepatobiliary malignancies, and drug-induced liver injury (Stättermayer2020Variants; Sticova2020ABCB4). Treatment options for these conditions include ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and, in severe cases, liver transplantation (Falguières2014ABCB4:).

## Interactions
ABCB4, also known as MDR3, interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function and localization in hepatocytes. One significant interaction is with the scaffold protein EBP50, also known as NHERF-1. This interaction is mediated by a PDZ-like motif at the C-terminus of ABCB4, specifically the QNL sequence. The QNL motif is essential for the binding of ABCB4 to EBP50, which regulates the protein's stability and cell surface expression at the canalicular membrane. Deletion of the QNL motif results in decreased stability and increased endocytosis of ABCB4, highlighting the importance of this interaction for maintaining ABCB4 at the cell surface (Venot2016A).

ABCB4 also interacts with other proteins involved in intracellular trafficking. These include the HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which may regulate ABCB4 endocytosis, and the receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1), which is essential for the expression and localization of ABCB4. The myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC2) might be required for ABCB4 trafficking, similar to its role with ABCB11 (Prescher2019ABCB4MDR3). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of ABCB4 in phosphatidylcholine translocation and bile formation.
