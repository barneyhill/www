# TPBG

## Overview
The TPBG gene encodes the trophoblast glycoprotein, a transmembrane protein that is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family. This protein is characterized by its extensive N-glycosylation and is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, bone, retina, and brain. Functionally, trophoblast glycoprotein is involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular mobility, playing a crucial role in processes such as chemotaxis and angiogenesis. It is particularly significant in the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling pathway, influencing cell migration and vascular repair under hypoxic conditions. The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms suggest its involvement in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its expression is often altered (Spencer2019Role; HE2012Trophoblast; Park2021Trophoblast).

## Structure
The TPBG gene encodes a 420-amino acid protein with a complex structure. The primary structure includes an N-terminal putative signal sequence, a 310-residue extracellular region, a membrane anchorage domain, and a 44-amino acid cytoplasmic tail with a potential phosphorylation site (Yadav2014TPBG). The extracellular region features seven potential N-glycosylation sites and seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are divided into two regions by a hydrophilic stretch (Yadav2014TPBG). The protein is heavily N-glycosylated, contributing to its function as a glycoprotein (Spencer2019Role).

The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeats, which are common motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Wakeham2020Expression). The intracellular domain is capped by a class 1 PDZ-interacting motif and contains two serine residues likely phosphorylated by protein kinase Cα (Tsuboi2020LRRContaining).

TPBG is expressed as a monomeric glycoprotein on the cell surface, with a molecular weight of 72 kDa and a 42-kDa core protein that undergoes extensive N-linked glycosylation (Yadav2014TPBG). The protein is classified as a single-pass type I membrane protein, indicating its quaternary structure as a monomeric entity embedded in the membrane (Yadav2014TPBG).

## Function
TPBG, or trophoblast glycoprotein, is a heavily N-glycosylated transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. It is part of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins and is expressed in several normal adult tissues, including the ovary, bone, retina, and brain (Park2021Trophoblast). TPBG plays a significant role in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and mobility by facilitating the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), which leads to CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis in differentiating embryonic stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts, and cancer cells (Park2021Trophoblast).

In human pericytes, TPBG is crucial for migratory and proangiogenic activities, particularly under hypoxic conditions. It modulates the CXCL12/CXCR7/pERK signaling pathway, affecting cell migration and angiogenesis (Spencer2019Role). TPBG expression is upregulated in response to hypoxia, enhancing the migratory activity of adventitial pericytes and supporting endothelial network formation (Spencer2019Role). The transcriptional regulation of TPBG involves CITED2, which binds to the TPBG promoter region, enhancing its transcription under hypoxic conditions (Spencer2019Role). These molecular activities suggest that TPBG plays a role in vascular repair and regeneration, contributing to its function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The TPBG (trophoblast glycoprotein) gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), TPBG is suggested to play a role in maintaining midbrain dopaminergic neuron homeostasis. Genetic ablation of TPBG in mice leads to the loss of these neurons, axonal defects, and PD-like symptoms, particularly in aged mice. These symptoms include reduced dopamine levels, increased α-synuclein accumulation, and motor deficits, indicating that TPBG mutations or expression alterations may contribute to PD pathogenesis by disrupting cellular processes such as RNA processing and protein quality control (Park2021Trophoblast).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TPBG is highly expressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Its expression correlates with tumor progression and metastasis, likely through the Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling pathway. Silencing TPBG in PDAC cell lines reduces cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer metastasis and as a potential therapeutic target (HE2012Trophoblast).

TPBG also influences angiogenesis and vascular formation, particularly under hypoxic conditions, through the CXCL12/CXCR7/pERK signaling pathway. Alterations in TPBG expression affect pericyte migratory and angiogenic activities, which may have implications in cardiovascular diseases (Spencer2019Role).

## Interactions
TPBG, also known as trophoblast glycoprotein, participates in several interactions with other proteins that influence cellular processes. One notable interaction is with GIPC1, a scaffolding protein, through its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is significant for cytoskeletal changes and cell motility, as demonstrated in HeLa cells using the yeast two-hybrid approach (Yadav2014TPBG).

TPBG is also involved in the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling pathway. It upregulates CXCL12 and prolongs its bioavailability by inhibiting DPP4, which cleaves CXCL12. This modulation affects gene transcription, proliferation, and directional movement of cancerous cells. CXCL12 binds to CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors, triggering intracellular signaling. TPBG downregulation leads to CXCR7 dominance, which signals through G-coupled protein-independent mechanisms and acts as a chemokine decoy receptor for CXCL12. Both CXCR4 and CXCR7 can form complexes with β-arrestin-2, promoting receptor internalization and signaling through alternative pathways like p38 MAPK/ERK activation (Spencer2019Role).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, TPBG interacts with components of the Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling pathway. Silencing TPBG reduces the expression of Wnt5a and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which are crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (HE2012Trophoblast).
