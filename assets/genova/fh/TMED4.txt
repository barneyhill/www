# TMED4

## Overview
TMED4, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 4, is a gene that encodes a type I single-pass transmembrane protein belonging to the p24 family, which is integral to vesicular trafficking processes within cells. The protein encoded by TMED4 is characterized by a conserved GOLD domain and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its role in protein transport and sorting within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Fiedler2016The; Schuiki2012Diverse). As a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain (TMED) family, TMED4 is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, including WNT and TGF-β, and plays a significant role in embryogenesis and cellular homeostasis (Aber2019Transmembrane). The protein's interactions with coatomer protein complexes and its involvement in both anterograde and retrograde transport underscore its importance in maintaining cellular function and development (Aber2019Transmembrane). Additionally, TMED4 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in the progression of gliomas, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and altered immune responses (Ullah2022Expression).

## Structure
TMED4, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 4, is a member of the p24 family of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking. It is characterized by a conserved GOLD domain, which is involved in carbohydrate interaction and is crucial for its function (Fiedler2016The). The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain that facilitates intermolecular interactions (Schuiki2012Diverse). TMED4 is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein, meaning it has a single transmembrane helix (Aber2019Transmembrane).

The quaternary structure of TMED4 involves the formation of oligomeric complexes, which are important for its stability and function (Schuiki2012Diverse). These complexes often include interactions with other p24 family members, contributing to the protein's role in the secretory pathway (Schuiki2012Diverse).

Post-translational modifications of TMED4 may include glycosylation within the GOLD domain, which can affect its interaction with ligands and potentially impede glycan binding if glycosylated (Fiedler2016The). This modification is significant as it can influence the protein's function in signaling pathways, such as the Wnt pathway (Fiedler2016The).

## Function
TMED4, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain (TMED) family, plays a crucial role in the secretory pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein trafficking. TMED4 is involved in the transport and sorting of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, facilitating vesicle formation and cargo selection (Aber2019Transmembrane). It is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein that interacts with coatomer (COP) protein complexes, aiding in both anterograde and retrograde transport (Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED4 is part of the α subfamily of TMED proteins and shares a common structural organization, including a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a luminal coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail. The GOLD domain is responsible for mediating dimerization, while the transmembrane domain interacts with lipids to assist in vesicle budding (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED4 is implicated in the regulation of various signaling pathways, such as WNT and TGF-β, and is essential for processes like embryogenesis and protein transport (Aber2019Transmembrane). Although specific functions of TMED4 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its involvement in these pathways suggests a significant role in cellular and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
TMED4 has been implicated in the progression of gliomas, including low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Overexpression of TMED4 is associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients, correlating with decreased overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival. This overexpression is linked to increased glioma grade and patient age, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Ullah2022Expression). TMED4 expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly B cells and CD8+ T cells in LGG, and is negatively correlated with natural killer cell infiltration. This suggests a potential role in modulating the immune response in glioma (Ullah2022Expression).

Alterations in the methylation status of TMED4, particularly reduced methylation in the promoter region, may contribute to its overexpression in glioma tissues (Ullah2022Expression). Copy number alterations, specifically amplifications, are more frequent in TMED4 compared to TMED9, and these genetic changes are negatively associated with survival outcomes in glioma patients (Ullah2022Expression). These findings highlight TMED4 as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in glioma.

## Interactions
TMED4, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain (TMED) family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in the secretory pathway. TMED4 interacts genetically with TMED10 (bai) and is essential for the dorsal-ventral patterning of embryos, particularly in the activity of maternally deposited Drosophila BMPR1, an orthologue of the mammalian TGF-β receptor BMPR1 (Aber2019Transmembrane). It is also implicated in WNT signaling, where it is required for Wg (Wingless) transport, with knockdown of TMED4 resulting in the retention of Wg in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced extracellular Wg levels (Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED4 is part of a family of cargo receptors that modulate the Wnt-TCF pathway, which is significant in colorectal cancer development (Fiedler2016The). It affects Dpp (decapentaplegic) signaling and is crucial for maintaining the activity of maternally expressed type I TGF-β receptor (Fiedler2016The). TMED4's interactions with the Wnt pathway and other signaling pathways suggest its role in cellular growth and patterning, particularly in cancer contexts (Fiedler2016The). However, specific physical interactions of TMED4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context.
