# FCER1G

## Overview
The FCER1G gene encodes the Fc receptor gamma chain (FcRγ), a critical signaling adaptor protein involved in immune cell function. This protein is categorized as a receptor and is integral to the signaling pathways of various immune receptors, including those on microglia and natural killer (NK) cells. The FcRγ protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is essential for initiating downstream signaling cascades that involve key molecules such as SYK and NF-kappa-B, thereby playing a significant role in immune responses (Feldner2023Skipping). FCER1G is also implicated in the regulation of immune responses during viral infections and is involved in platelet activation through its interactions with glycoprotein VI (GPVI) (Gibbins1996Tyrosine; Duhan2019NK). Alterations in FCER1G expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2017Coexpression; Zhang2019Elimination).

## Structure


## Function
The FCER1G gene encodes the Fc receptor gamma chain (FcRγ), a signaling adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in immune cell function. This protein is primarily expressed in microglia, a type of immune cell in the brain, and is involved in mediating signaling from various Fc receptors and immune receptors, including FcRIα, FcγRI, FcγRIIIa, FcαRI, GPVI, OSCAR, PIR-A, Dectin-2, γδTCR, and IL-3R (Feldner2023Skipping). The FcRγ protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domain, which is essential for initiating downstream signaling pathways upon receptor engagement. These pathways involve key molecules such as SYK, CARD9, and NF-kappa-B, which are important for immune responses (Feldner2023Skipping).

In addition to its role in microglia, FcRγ is also involved in the regulation of CD8+ T-cell functions during viral infections. It stabilizes the NKp46 protein on natural killer (NK) cells, preventing its degradation and thereby influencing NK cell signaling. This stabilization is crucial for the regulatory function of NK cells, particularly in limiting CD8+ T-cell expansion during chronic viral infections (Duhan2019NK).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCER1G gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and autoimmune conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FCER1G is identified as a hub gene associated with disease progression and prognosis. High expression levels of FCER1G correlate with shorter overall survival and are linked to immune-related pathways, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in ccRCC (Chen2017Coexpression; Dong2022FCER1G).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), FCER1G expression is associated with the infiltration of activated memory CD4+ T cells, and higher expression levels are linked to a higher risk and shorter overall survival. This suggests that FCER1G could serve as a predictive biomarker for assessing disease prognosis and treatment response in DLBCL (Xiang2022Identification).

In autoimmune peripheral neuropathies, the elimination of the Fc receptor gamma chain (Fcer1g) in mouse models has shown protective effects against neuropathic disease, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Targeting FCER1G may offer therapeutic potential in reducing inflammation and nerve injury in such neuropathies (Zhang2019Elimination).

## Interactions
FCER1G, also known as the Fc receptor γ-chain, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate immune response signaling. In platelets, FCER1G is rapidly phosphorylated upon collagen stimulation, which promotes its interaction with the tyrosine kinase Syk. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of a signaling complex that leads to platelet activation (Gibbins1996Tyrosine). The phosphorylation of FCER1G's immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) recruits Syk, which itself becomes phosphorylated and activated, suggesting a role for a Src-family kinase in this process (Gibbins1996Tyrosine).

FCER1G is also physically associated with glycoprotein VI (GPVI) in human platelets, forming a complex that acts as a collagen receptor. This association is essential for the activation of Syk upon GPVI cross-linking, indicating that FCER1G and GPVI are co-expressed and function together in collagen-induced platelet activation (Tsuji1997A). The absence of GPVI results in a deficiency of FCER1G expression, highlighting their interdependent relationship (Tsuji1997A). These interactions underscore the role of FCER1G in immune signaling pathways, particularly in the context of platelet activation and immune cell signaling.
