# PRKAR2B

## Overview
PRKAR2B is a gene that encodes the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type II regulatory subunit beta, a crucial component of the protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme. This regulatory subunit plays a significant role in cAMP-mediated signaling pathways, which are vital for various cellular processes such as metabolism, cell division, and gene expression. The protein encoded by PRKAR2B is primarily involved in modulating PKA activity by binding cAMP, which leads to the release and activation of catalytic subunits. It is categorized as a regulatory subunit within the kinase family and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, with associations to cellular membranes. PRKAR2B is also implicated in adipocyte differentiation and neuronal signaling, influencing energy balance, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation (Xia2020PRKAR2B‐HIF‐1α; Weise2018FOXG1; Peverelli2013PKA).

## Function
PRKAR2B encodes the type II beta regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), which plays a crucial role in cAMP-mediated signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, PRKAR2B modulates PKA activity by binding cAMP, leading to the release and activation of catalytic subunits. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including metabolism, cell division, and gene expression (Xia2020PRKAR2B‐HIF‐1α).

PRKAR2B is involved in adipocyte differentiation, where its expression increases during the differentiation process. It is crucial for the expression of key adipogenic markers such as PPARg, fatty acid synthase, aP2, and lipoprotein lipase, indicating its significant role in adipogenesis (Peverelli2013PKA). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with cellular membranes, where it influences energy balance and storage (Xia2020PRKAR2B‐HIF‐1α).

In the central nervous system, PRKAR2B is implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory formation by phosphorylating AMPA receptor subunits and the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR, which are important for emotional responses to stress (Weise2018FOXG1). This highlights its role in neuronal signaling and cognitive functions.

## Clinical Significance
The PRKAR2B gene is implicated in the progression and metastasis of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Overexpression of PRKAR2B is associated with increased cell invasion and metastasis, particularly in CRPC and metastatic CRPC tissues compared to primary prostate cancer specimens (Sha2018PRKAR2B). This gene promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which are crucial for cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Sha2018PRKAR2B). PRKAR2B also enhances the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, which is linked to tumor growth and poor prognosis in cancer patients (Xia2020PRKAR2B‐HIF‐1α).

In prostate cancer, PRKAR2B expression is regulated by microRNAs miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p, which are downregulated in metastatic CRPC, and by the transcription factor XBP1. These regulatory mechanisms suggest that PRKAR2B acts as a functional mediator in prostate cancer, promoting cell proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis (Xia2020Transcriptional). The gene's dysregulation is not attributed to mutations, copy number alterations, or epigenetic changes, but rather to these specific regulatory pathways (Xia2020Transcriptional). PRKAR2B's role in CRPC highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for managing advanced prostate cancer.

## Interactions
PRKAR2B, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), participates in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms a holoenzyme with catalytic subunits and interacts with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which localize PKA to specific cellular compartments, thereby modulating its activity. PRKAR2B also interacts with proteins such as PDE4D and MAP2, which are involved in signal transduction pathways.

In the context of hypoxia, PRKAR2B transcription is repressed by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which sequesters the transcription factor Sp1 from the PRKAR2B promoter. This interaction leads to increased PKA activity, as the RIIβ subunit encoded by PRKAR2B is a regulatory component that modulates PKA activity (Lucia2020Hypoxia).

PRKAR2B is also involved in interactions related to disease processes. In Theileria annulata-infected leukocytes, miR-34c-3p targets PRKAR2B mRNA, reducing its expression and leading to increased PKA activity. This interaction occurs independently of cAMP levels and influences the dissemination of transformed macrophages (Haidar2020miR34c3p).

In prostate cancer, PRKAR2B expression is regulated by miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p, which bind to its 3′-untranslated region, reducing its mRNA levels. The transcription factor XBP1 enhances PRKAR2B expression by binding to its promoter region, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Xia2020Transcriptional).
