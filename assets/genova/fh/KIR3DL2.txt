# KIR3DL2

## Overview
KIR3DL2 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, three Ig domains and long cytoplasmic tail 2, a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T-cell subsets. This receptor is part of the larger family of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which play a pivotal role in the immune system by regulating NK cell activity through interactions with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules. KIR3DL2 is characterized by its three immunoglobulin-like domains and a long cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its inhibitory function. The receptor's ability to bind to HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-A3, HLA-A11, and HLA-B27, is essential for maintaining immune self-tolerance and modulating immune responses (Hansasuta2004Recognition; Shaw2012New). KIR3DL2 has clinical significance in various diseases, including cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and preeclampsia, and is a target for therapeutic interventions (Bagot2019IPH4102; Wang2011Genetic).

## Structure
KIR3DL2, also known as CD158k, is a killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor with a distinct molecular structure. The protein is composed of a signal peptide, three immunoglobulin-like domains (D0, D1, and D2), a stem region, a transmembrane region, and a long cytoplasmic tail. The D0, D1, and D2 domains are 96, 102, and 98 amino acids in length, respectively, while the stem and transmembrane regions are 24 and 20 amino acids long (Shaw2012New). The cytoplasmic tail is notably long, comprising 96 amino acids and containing two immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its regulatory functions (Shaw2012New).

KIR3DL2 is expressed as a 140 kDa dimer, with two unpaired cysteines in the stem region at positions 302 and 336, potentially facilitating disulfide-bonded dimerization (Shaw2012New). The D0 domain is particularly significant for ligand binding, playing a key role in interactions with oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and certain HLA class I molecules (Hansasuta2004Recognition; Sivori2010A). KIR3DL2 also undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability. There are 84 allelic variants of KIR3DL2, with 62 encoding potential proteins, differing mainly by amino acid substitutions in the D0 domain (Shaw2012New).

## Function
KIR3DL2, also known as CD158k or p140, is a killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. It plays a crucial role in the immune response by modulating NK cell activity. KIR3DL2 binds to specific HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-A3, HLA-A11, and HLA-B27, in a peptide-dependent manner, which is essential for regulating NK cell function and maintaining self-tolerance (Hansasuta2004Recognition; Shaw2012New). This receptor is involved in the "missing-self" hypothesis, where the absence of HLA class I molecules on target cells relieves the inhibitory signals on NK cells, allowing them to attack potentially harmful cells (Du2006Receptorligand).

In healthy individuals, KIR3DL2 is expressed at higher levels on certain T cell subsets compared to other KIRs, suggesting it may serve as a default receptor (Shaw2012New). It is particularly enriched on memory T cells and is associated with promoter hypomethylation and an active histone signature, although the specific factors controlling its expression remain unclear (Shaw2012New). KIR3DL2's interaction with HLA-B27 is unique as it can occur independently of the peptide sequence, unlike its interaction with other HLA class I ligands (Shaw2012New).

## Clinical Significance
The KIR3DL2 gene is clinically significant in several diseases due to its role in immune regulation. In cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, particularly Sézary syndrome, KIR3DL2 is highly expressed in over 85% of patients, making it a crucial diagnostic and prognostic marker. The monoclonal antibody IPH4102 targets KIR3DL2 to deplete these cells, showing promise in treating relapsed or refractory cases of the disease (Bagot2019IPH4102).

In the context of preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication, genetic polymorphisms in KIR3DL2 have been studied. The A allele in exon 3 of KIR3DL2 is associated with a decreased susceptibility to preeclampsia, suggesting a protective role against the condition (Wang2011Genetic).

KIR3DL2 expression is also altered in chronic hepatitis C virus (CHCV) infections. Decreased expression of KIR3DL2 in certain NK cell subsets is linked to a high body mass index and may contribute to the rapid progression of CHCV to fibrosis. This suggests that changes in KIR3DL2 expression could influence the clinical outcomes of CHCV-related liver conditions (Podhorzer2018The).

## Interactions
KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T-cell subpopulations. It interacts with HLA class I molecules, particularly HLA-A3 and HLA-A11, to modulate immune responses. These interactions can inhibit NK cell activity, contributing to immune regulation (Graef2009KIR2DS4).

In the context of aggressive systemic peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), KIR3DL2 is expressed in neoplastic T cells and can be targeted therapeutically. The humanized anti-KIR3DL2 monoclonal antibody, lacutamab, has demonstrated antitumor activity through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro and in clinical trials. This suggests that KIR3DL2's interaction with lacutamab can lead to the destruction of KIR3DL2-expressing tumor cells (Decroos2023KIR3DL2).

KIR3DL2 expression is regulated by DNA methylation, and its expression can be modulated by chemotherapy agents like gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, potentially enhancing the efficacy of lacutamab. This regulation suggests a dynamic interaction between KIR3DL2 expression and epigenetic modifiers, which can be exploited for therapeutic purposes (Decroos2023KIR3DL2).
