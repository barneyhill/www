# GOLGA2

## Overview
GOLGA2 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A2, commonly referred to as GM130, which is a crucial component of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. Golgin A2 is categorized as a cis-Golgi matrix protein and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the Golgi apparatus. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein secretion, sorting, and maintaining cellular polarity. It acts as a molecular link between the Golgi apparatus and the cytoskeleton, facilitating microtubule organization necessary for cell division, migration, and ciliogenesis (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2). The interactions of golgin A2 with other proteins, such as p115 and GRASP65, are essential for its role in vesicle docking and Golgi localization (Munro2011The). Mutations in the GOLGA2 gene have been associated with neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its critical role in cellular and developmental processes (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2; Liu2021The).

## Structure


## Function
GOLGA2, also known as GM130, is a critical protein involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus in human cells. It plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for protein secretion, sorting, and maintaining cellular polarity (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2). GM130 acts as a molecular link between the Golgi apparatus and the cytoskeleton, which is vital for the organization of microtubules necessary for cell division, migration, and ciliogenesis (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2). 

In healthy cells, GM130 is crucial for maintaining the Golgi's reticular structure, ensuring efficient secretory cargo trafficking (Liu2021The). It interacts with the vesicle docking protein p115 to maintain ER-to-Golgi transport vesicles and promotes microtubule nucleation and growth at the cis-Golgi by recruiting the nucleation-promoting factor AKAP450 (Donizy2019Selected). GM130 also plays a role in Golgi apparatus fragmentation during mitosis, ensuring equal partitioning into daughter cells (Donizy2019Selected). 

The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including polarized cell migration and autophagy regulation, by interacting with other proteins such as Tuba and GABARAP (Donizy2019Selected). GM130's function is regulated post-translationally, such as through arginine methylation by PRMT5, which is crucial for maintaining Golgi structure (Donizy2019Selected).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GOLGA2 gene, which encodes the protein GM130, have been linked to a range of neuromuscular disorders. A notable case involves a patient with a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in GOLGA2, resulting in a neuromuscular disorder characterized by developmental delay, seizures, progressive microcephaly, and muscular dystrophy (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2). This mutation leads to a likely null effect at the protein level, as evidenced by the absence of the expected protein band in immunoblotting (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2). The clinical manifestations in humans were mirrored in zebrafish models, where knockdown of golga2 resulted in severe skeletal muscle disorganization and microcephaly, underscoring the gene's critical role in muscle and brain development (Shamseldin2016GOLGA2).

In addition to neuromuscular disorders, mutations in GOLGA2 have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of GM130 disrupts Golgi architecture and positioning in cerebellar Purkinje cells, leading to progressive cerebellar atrophy and associated movement disorders (Liu2021The). These findings highlight the essential role of GOLGA2 in maintaining Golgi structure and function, with its disruption leading to significant cellular and developmental abnormalities.

## Interactions
GOLGA2, also known as GM130, is a cis-Golgi protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with GRASP65, a lipid-anchored PDZ domain protein, at its carboxyl terminus, which is essential for its Golgi localization (Munro2011The). GOLGA2 also binds to p115, a cytosolic protein involved in tethering endoplasmic reticulum-derived transport vesicles to the Golgi, and acts as an effector for small GTPases Rab1, Rab30, and Rab33b (Munro2011The).

GOLGA2 is part of a complex with CCM3/PDCD10 and SOK1, where SOK1 serves as a bridge between CCM3/PDCD10 and GOLGA2. This interaction is crucial for maintaining Golgi integrity, as depletion of CCM3/PDCD10 leads to Golgi disassembly (Sugden2013SOcK). GOLGA2 also interacts with SOK1 and MST4, two GCKIII kinases, enhancing SOK1 activity. This interaction involves the coiled-coil structure of GOLGA2 and specific residues of SOK1 (Sugden2013SOcK).

While initially thought not to interact with MST3, later studies showed that overexpressed MST3 does interact with GOLGA2, although this interaction decreases when MST3 is activated (Sugden2013SOcK).
