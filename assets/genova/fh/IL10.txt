# IL10

## Overview
Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine encoded by the IL10 gene, which is located on chromosome 1q32. The IL10 gene is approximately 2 kb in length and comprises five exons that encode different structural components of the IL-10 protein (Wei2019Interleukin10). The IL-10 protein is categorized as a cytokine and is known for its potent anti-inflammatory properties, playing a crucial role in immune regulation and maintaining homeostasis (Krawiec2021Interleukin). It is produced by various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and functions by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Carlini2023The; Saraiva2019Biology). IL-10's ability to modulate immune responses is essential for preventing tissue damage during immune reactions and maintaining a balanced immune response (Carlini2023The). The protein's structure as an intercalated dimer, stabilized by disulfide bridges, is critical for its function and interaction with its receptor complex, which activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Zdanov2004Structural; AcunerOzbabacan2014The).

## Structure
The IL-10 protein is an intercalated dimer composed of two subunits, each consisting of six amphipathic helices labeled A-F. The polypeptide chains of each subunit contribute to both parts of the dimer, forming a distinctive six-helix domain through a 180-degree rotation around a twofold axis (Zdanov2004Structural). The structure is stabilized by two intramolecular disulfide bridges, Cys12-Cys108 and Cys62-Cys114, which hold together helices A, C, and D, forming a frame with a long depression in the middle (Zdanov2004Structural). The internal surface of this frame is hydrophobic, and when helices E' and F' cover the depression, most hydrophobic residues are involved in forming the intradomain hydrophobic core (Zdanov2004Structural).

The IL-10 gene is located on chromosome 1q32 and is approximately 2 kb long, consisting of five exons. Each exon encodes different structural parts of the IL-10 protein: exon 1 encodes the signal peptide and the A helix; exon 2 encodes the AB loop and Helix B; exon 3 encodes the C and D helices; exon 4 encodes the DE loop and the E helix; and exon 5 encodes the F helix (Wei2019Interleukin10). IL-10 is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and is involved in various immune regulatory functions (Wei2019Interleukin10).

## Function
Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine with significant roles in maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which are crucial in preventing tissue damage during immune responses. IL-10 is produced by various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and acts by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby suppressing the activation and function of antigen-presenting cells (Carlini2023The; Hedrich2010Cell; Saraiva2019Biology).

IL-10 plays a critical role in balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, ensuring effective pathogen clearance while preventing excessive inflammation that could lead to tissue damage. It achieves this by modulating immune responses in a cell-specific manner, responding to environmental stimuli and metabolic changes (Carlini2023The). IL-10 also promotes the survival and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are essential for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses (Ouyang2019IL10).

Beyond its immunosuppressive functions, IL-10 has immunostimulatory activities, such as enhancing the survival and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells and promoting the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells (Carlini2023The). These diverse roles highlight IL-10's importance in orchestrating a balanced immune response, crucial for maintaining overall organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL10 gene or its receptor components, IL10RA and IL10RB, are associated with severe clinical phenotypes, particularly early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These mutations can lead to life-threatening colitis with perianal lesions, granulomatous enterocolitis, and extraintestinal manifestations such as folliculitis, eczema, arthritis, and autoimmune hepatitis (Sharifinejad2022The; Krawiec2021Interleukin). IL10 and IL10R deficiencies are monogenic autosomal recessive diseases with full penetrance, often manifesting as early-onset colitis in infants (Krawiec2021Interleukin; Glocker2011IL‐10).

Alterations in IL10 expression levels are linked to various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. High levels of IL10 are associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, while IL10 deficiency can lead to exaggerated inflammation, contributing to chronic inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Carlini2023The). IL10R deficiencies are also linked to severe clinical phenotypes, including rheumatologic and renal disorders, hepatosplenomegaly, and malignancy (Sharifinejad2022The).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been highlighted as an effective therapeutic approach for severe IL10/IL10R mutations, offering a potential curative treatment (Shouval2014Interleukin).

## Interactions
Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that interacts with a variety of proteins to modulate immune responses. IL-10 primarily binds to a tetrameric receptor complex composed of two IL-10R-alpha (IL-10RA) and two IL-10R-beta (IL-10RB) subunits. The IL-10RA subunit has a higher affinity for IL-10 and binds first, followed by IL-10RB, which acts as an accessory signaling subunit (AcunerOzbabacan2014The). This binding activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, crucial for IL-10's role in immune regulation and cancer progression (Verma2015A).

IL-10 also forms a stable complex with α2-macroglobulin (A2M), a proteinase inhibitor, which protects IL-10 from proteolysis and mediates its anti-inflammatory responses (AcunerOzbabacan2014The). Mutations in IL-10 or its receptor subunits can disrupt these interactions, potentially leading to enhanced inflammation and tumor growth (AcunerOzbabacan2014The).

In the context of viral interactions, human cytomegalovirus IL-10 (cmvIL-10) binds to the human IL-10 receptor 1 (sIL-10R1) with similar affinity as human IL-10, despite low sequence identity. This interaction involves a 1:2 complex formation, where two sIL-10R1 molecules bind to the cmvIL-10 dimer, highlighting the structural similarities between viral and human IL-10 interactions (Jones2002Crystal).
