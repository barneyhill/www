# DNM3

## Overview
The DNM3 gene encodes the protein dynamin 3, a member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPase proteins. Dynamin 3 is primarily involved in membrane remodeling processes, including endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, which are critical for cellular communication and homeostasis. This protein is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it plays a role in synaptic function by modulating receptor recycling and excitatory synaptic transmission. Additionally, dynamin 3 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, where it acts as a potential modifier of disease onset and a tumor suppressor, respectively. The gene's expression and function in different tissues underscore its importance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions (Lu2021Dynamin; Romeu2014Classical; Praefcke2004The; Trinh2016DNM3).

## Function
Dynamin 3 (DNM3) is a member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPase proteins, which are involved in membrane remodeling processes such as endocytosis and vesicle trafficking. In healthy human cells, DNM3 plays a crucial role in the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), aiding in their detachment from the parent membrane. This function is essential for processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular trafficking, which are vital for cellular communication and homeostasis (Romeu2014Classical; Praefcke2004The).

DNM3 is particularly active in the central nervous system (CNS), where it reaches its maximum expression levels. This suggests a significant role in synaptic function, as it is involved in the modulation of receptor recycling and excitatory synaptic transmission in neurons. DNM3 localizes to the endocytic machinery of dendritic spines, where it regulates actin polymerization, filopodia, and spine formation (Romeu2014Classical; Trinh2016DNM3).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, DNM3 has been implicated as a potential modifier of the age of onset in LRRK2 p.G2019S parkinsonism, although it does not contribute to the risk of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Trinh2016DNM3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DNM3 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of 1q24.3 microdeletion syndrome, deletions affecting the DNM3 gene are linked to growth deficiencies, intellectual disabilities, and skeletal abnormalities. This syndrome is characterized by features such as short stature, microcephaly, and autism spectrum disorder-like characteristics (Shepherdson2021Delineation). The DNM3 gene is implicated in skeletal and intellectual phenotypes, with its protein being the only dynamin expressed in the brain, playing roles in synapse cargo trafficking (Shepherdson2021Delineation).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low expression of DNM3 is associated with poor patient survival and increased metastasis. DNM3 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the formation of the c-MET–GBR2–STAT3 complex, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Reduced DNM3 expression enhances the proliferative and metastatic abilities of lung cancer cells, while its upregulation suppresses these processes (Lu2021Dynamin). These findings suggest that DNM3 plays a significant role in both developmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in clinical research and potential therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
Dynamin 3 (DNM3) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), DNM3 interacts with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), forming a complex that is crucial for the regulation of the c-MET–GRB2–STAT3 signaling pathway. DNM3 competes with GRB2 for binding, thereby inhibiting the formation of the c-MET–GRB2–STAT3 complex and suppressing STAT3 activation. This interaction is significant in controlling cell proliferation and migration in lung cancer cells (Lu2021Dynamin).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DNM3 is associated with the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are linked to apoptosis. Although the specific physical interactions of DNM3 with iNOS are not detailed, the functional interaction suggests a role in modulating apoptosis through NO production (Gu2017Dynamin).

In human spermatozoa, DNM3 is present but shows minimal interaction with other proteins involved in acrosomal exocytosis, as its expression does not significantly overlap with germ cells (Zhou2017Characterization).
