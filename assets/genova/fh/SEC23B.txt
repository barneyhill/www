# SEC23B

## Overview
SEC23B is a gene that encodes the SEC23 homolog B, a critical component of the coat protein complex II (COPII), which is involved in the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The SEC23B protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and disassembly of the COPII coat, essential for vesicle biogenesis and recycling (Russo2010Mutational). Beyond its canonical role in vesicular transport, SEC23B is implicated in cellular stress response pathways, including ER stress and ribosome biogenesis, and is known to interact with various proteins involved in these processes (Yehia2021Noncanonical). Mutations in the SEC23B gene are associated with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA II), highlighting its clinical significance (Bianchi2009Congenital).

## Structure
The SEC23B protein is a component of the COPII coat complex, essential for vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It is composed of 767 amino acid residues organized into five distinct domains: zinc finger, trunk, beta-sheet, helical, and gelsolin-like domains (Russo2010Mutational; Bi2002Structure). The zinc finger domain is located at the periphery of the complex, contributing to the basic inner surface, while the trunk domain forms the dimer interface and contacts Sar1 (Bi2002Structure). The gelsolin-like domain is involved in critical catalytic interactions with Sar1 and extends radially away from the membrane (Bi2002Structure).

The SEC23B protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that activates Sar1, a small GTPase, which is part of the COPII complex (Russo2010Mutational). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in the assembly and disassembly of the COPII coat, which is necessary for vesicle biogenesis and recycling (Russo2010Mutational). Mutations in SEC23B can disrupt these interactions, leading to congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA II) (Bianchi2009Congenital). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by its interactions with other coat subunits, such as Sec24, Sar1, and Sec31 (Russo2010Mutational).

## Function
The SEC23B gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the coat protein complex II (COPII), which is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This process is vital for proper protein sorting and secretion, maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Paccaud1996Cloning; Khoriaty2017SEC23B). In healthy human cells, SEC23B is involved in the cellular stress response pathways, particularly within the ER stress and ribosome biogenesis pathways. It localizes not only to the ER/Golgi interface but also to the nucleus and nucleoli under certain conditions, such as proteasome inhibition, indicating a non-canonical role in cellular stress response independent of COPII (Yehia2021Noncanonical).

SEC23B interacts with nuclear proteins and is involved in ER stress, protein ubiquitination, and EIF2 signaling pathways. Its levels increase in response to ER stress, suggesting its role as a sensor or effector in the cellular stress response (Yehia2021Noncanonical). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm, particularly around the ER membrane, is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of secretory cells, such as pancreatic acinar cells, and is implicated in the proper functioning of erythroid precursors (Bianchi2009Congenital; Khoriaty2017SEC23B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEC23B gene are primarily associated with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA II), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and morphological abnormalities in red blood cells. Clinical manifestations of CDA II include mild to severe anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, liver iron overload, and gallstones (Musri2023New; Russo2010Mutational). The disorder is linked to various mutations in the SEC23B gene, including missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splicing mutations, which lead to decreased SEC23B protein levels and impaired glycosylation of membrane proteins (Musri2023New; Russo2010Mutational).

The SEC23B gene mutations disrupt the coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, affecting bone morphogenic protein signaling and leading to hepcidin repression, which increases iron absorption and can cause systemic iron overload (Musri2023New). Diagnosis of CDA II often involves identifying specific bone marrow abnormalities and reduced glycosylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins (Russo2010Mutational). Treatment options include red cell transfusions, iron chelation, and splenectomy, though the latter's efficacy is debated. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been used successfully as a curative treatment (Musri2023New).

## Interactions
SEC23B, a component of the COPII coat complex, participates in various protein interactions that extend beyond its traditional role in vesicular transport. It interacts with UBA52, a ribosomal protein involved in stress-related transcript translation and protein synthesis, which is validated through immunoprecipitation experiments (Yehia2021Noncanonical). SEC23B also interacts with proteins involved in the cellular stress response, such as those in the protein ubiquitination pathway and EIF2 signaling (Yehia2021Noncanonical).

In the context of the COPII complex, SEC23B forms a heterodimer with SEC24, which is recruited to the ER surface by SAR1-GTP, and interacts with SEC13 and SEC31 to form the inner and outer layers of the COPII coat (Khoriaty2016Pancreatic). SEC23B's interaction with SAR1 is crucial for the recruitment and assembly of the COPII coat (Yong2021Cancerdriving).

SEC23B also interacts with proteins involved in cancer metastasis, such as EPCAM and CD9, which are important for cell adhesion and mobility. The deletion of SEC23B impairs the transport of these proteins, leading to increased cell migration and invasion (Yang2020Mutations). These interactions highlight SEC23B's multifaceted role in cellular processes beyond vesicular transport.
