# SLC36A1

## Overview
The SLC36A1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 36 member 1 (PAT1), a proton-coupled amino acid transporter that plays a critical role in the transport of small, unbranched, zwitterionic amino acids across cellular membranes. PAT1 is a transmembrane protein characterized by nine transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function in various tissues, including the small intestine and brain (Chen2003Structure). In the small intestine, PAT1 is involved in the absorption of amino acids and certain drugs, influencing their bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (Thwaites2011The). In the central nervous system, it contributes to neurotransmitter transport, particularly in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (Thwaites2011The). The activity of PAT1 is pH-dependent and Na+-independent, relying on the proton gradient maintained by the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (Anderson2005Indirect). The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, particularly in the context of drug resistance and amino acid metabolism disorders (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria; Yoshida2019SLC36A1mTORC1).

## Structure
The SLC36A1 gene encodes the PAT1 protein, a proton-coupled amino acid transporter. The primary structure of the human PAT1 protein consists of 476 amino acids, as determined from its cDNA sequence (Chen2003Structure). The protein is predicted to have nine transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in transporting amino acids across cell membranes (Chen2003Structure). This differs from previous models for rat and mouse PAT1, which suggested eleven transmembrane domains (Chen2003Structure).

The secondary structure of PAT1 includes these transmembrane domains, which are likely composed of alpha helices, a common feature in membrane proteins. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function as a transporter, although specific details on the folding pattern are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation at specific asparagine residues are important for the membrane targeting of PAT1 (Thwaites2011The). Additionally, disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues Cys 180 and Cys 329 is crucial for stabilizing the substrate binding site, which is essential for the protein's function and localization (Thwaites2011The). There is no information provided on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The SLC36A1 gene encodes the PAT1 protein, a proton-coupled amino acid transporter involved in the uptake of small, unbranched, zwitterionic amino acids and their derivatives. PAT1 is expressed at the luminal surface of the small intestine and in lysosomes of various cell types, including neurons, indicating its role in both amino acid absorption and lysosomal efflux (Thwaites2011The). In the small intestine, PAT1 facilitates the transport of amino acids and amino acid-based drugs across the intestinal wall, impacting their pharmacokinetic profiles (Thwaites2011The).

In the brain, PAT1 is involved in neurotransmitter transport, particularly in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and is expressed in regions such as the cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Thwaites2011The). The transporter operates in a pH-dependent, Na+-independent manner, utilizing the inward movement of protons to facilitate amino acid uptake (Anderson2005Indirect). Its activity is influenced by the H+ electrochemical gradient, and it is indirectly regulated by the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, which maintains the intracellular pH necessary for PAT1 function (Thwaites2011The; Anderson2005Indirect). PAT1's function is crucial for amino acid homeostasis and cellular nutrient sensing, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Thwaites2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC36A1 gene is implicated in acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma. This resistance is associated with the reactivation of mTORC1 signaling, driven by increased expression of the SLC36A1 transporter. Two primary mechanisms contribute to this resistance: the loss of Rb, which leads to mTORC1 activation through E2f-dependent induction of SLC36A1, and the accumulation of FXR1, which directly regulates SLC36A1 protein synthesis (Yoshida2019SLC36A1mTORC1). Overexpression of SLC36A1 can override CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced senescence, suggesting its role as a driver of resistance (Yoshida2019SLC36A1mTORC1).

In the context of amino acid metabolism, SLC36A1 is involved in the transport of small amino acids. Alterations in its expression or function can impact amino acid homeostasis, potentially contributing to conditions like iminoglycinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder affecting renal tubular transport. While SLC36A1 is mentioned as a low-affinity transporter for proline, hydroxyproline, and glycine, its direct involvement in iminoglycinuria is less clear compared to SLC36A2 (Bröer2008Iminoglycinuria). The gene's role in drug absorption and nutrient transport may also have clinical implications (Kandasamy2018Amino).

## Interactions
The SLC36A1 gene encodes the proton-coupled amino acid transporter PAT1, which is involved in various interactions with other proteins. PAT1 is indirectly regulated by the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, which maintains the H+ electrochemical gradient necessary for PAT1 function. This interaction is crucial for the optimal uptake of dipeptides and amino acids, as NHE3 activity influences the pH gradient that drives PAT1-mediated transport (Anderson2005Indirect). 

The regulation of PAT1 is also modulated through the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which affects NHE3 activity. This pathway, activated by physiological activators like VIP and PACAP, indirectly regulates PAT1 by modulating the electrochemical gradient required for amino acid uptake (Anderson2005Indirect). 

PAT1's function is further influenced by specific amino acid residues and glycosylation at certain asparagine residues, which are important for its membrane targeting and transport efficiency. Disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues stabilizes the substrate binding site of PAT1, highlighting the importance of protein structure in its interactions (Thwaites2011The). These interactions and regulatory mechanisms underscore the complex role of PAT1 in cellular processes.
