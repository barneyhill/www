# SLC5A3

## Overview
The SLC5A3 gene encodes the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter 1 (SMIT1), a member of the solute carrier family 5, which is integral to cellular osmoregulation. This transmembrane protein facilitates the uptake of myo-inositol, a crucial osmolyte, into cells, particularly under hypertonic conditions, thereby maintaining osmotic balance and cell volume (Dai2016Osmoregulatory; Schneider2015Inositol). SMIT1 is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the brain and kidney, where it plays a vital role in cellular signaling and homeostasis by modulating phosphoinositide levels, which are important for ion channel regulation and neuronal excitability (Dai2016Osmoregulatory; Buccafusca2008Characterization). The gene's expression is regulated by osmoregulatory mechanisms, with transcription factor TonEBP enhancing its expression in response to hypertonic stress (Wright2013Glucose; Schneider2015Inositol). SLC5A3's involvement in various cellular processes and its dysregulation in conditions such as Down syndrome, psychiatric disorders, and certain cancers underscore its clinical significance (Vawter2019Association; Schneider2015Inositol; Cui2022The).

## Function
The SLC5A3 gene encodes the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter 1 (SMIT1), which is crucial for osmoregulation in human cells. SMIT1 facilitates the uptake of myo-inositol, a key osmolyte, into cells, particularly under hypertonic conditions. This process is vital for maintaining osmotic balance and cell volume, especially in tissues such as the brain and kidney (Dai2016Osmoregulatory; Schneider2015Inositol). Myo-inositol serves as a precursor for phosphoinositides, which are important signaling lipids involved in various cellular functions, including the regulation of ion channels and cellular excitability (Dai2016Osmoregulatory).

The expression of SLC5A3 is upregulated in response to hypertonic stress, mediated by the transcription factor TonEBP, which enhances SMIT1 expression to increase intracellular osmolarity and protect cells from osmotic stress (Wright2013Glucose; Schneider2015Inositol). SMIT1 is active in the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of cell signaling and membrane potential by modulating phosphoinositide levels, which affect ion channel activities and neuronal excitability (Dai2016Osmoregulatory; Buccafusca2008Characterization). This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function under varying osmotic conditions.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC5A3 gene, encoding the sodium/myo-inositol transporter 1 (SMIT1), is implicated in several diseases due to its role in myo-inositol transport. In Down syndrome, the overexpression of SLC5A3, resulting from an extra copy of chromosome 21, leads to elevated myo-inositol levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, potentially contributing to the syndrome's phenotype and associated Alzheimer-like neuropathology (Berry1995The; Schneider2015Inositol). 

In psychiatric disorders, altered SLC5A3 expression is linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Increased SLC5A3 expression has been observed in schizophrenia, while its knockout in mice results in behavioral deficits that mimic symptoms of these disorders. Chronic myo-inositol administration can reverse some of these deficits, suggesting a compensatory mechanism (Vawter2019Association).

SLC5A3 also plays a role in cancer, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In NSCLC, SLC5A3 overexpression promotes tumorigenic activity, while its depletion induces apoptosis in cancer cells (Cui2022The). In AML, SLC5A3 dependency is linked to a myo-inositol auxotrophy, with its inhibition impairing the growth of certain AML cell lines (Wei2020In).

## Interactions
The SLC5A3 gene encodes the SMIT1 protein, which is involved in the transport of myo-inositol and interacts with various proteins to regulate cellular functions. SMIT1 is known to interact with potassium channel subunits KCNQ1 and KCNE2. These interactions can inhibit myo-inositol uptake when coexpressed with SMIT1, suggesting a feedback mechanism that regulates cell signaling and homeostasis (Schneider2015Inositol).

SMIT1 activity is also modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its transport function. Protein kinase C downregulation increases myo-inositol transport, while protein kinase A activation decreases it. The serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 phosphorylates SMIT1, enhancing its activity by increasing its presence in the plasma membrane, particularly under hypertonic conditions (Schneider2015Inositol).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SLC5A3 is involved in the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Silencing or knockout of SLC5A3 leads to decreased phosphorylation of Akt and S6K1, indicating reduced pathway activation. Conversely, overexpression of SLC5A3 enhances Akt-mTOR activation, promoting cancer cell growth and survival (Cui2022The). These interactions highlight the role of SLC5A3 in cellular signaling and its potential impact on disease progression.
