# IFNA2

## Overview
The IFNA2 gene encodes the interferon alpha 2 (IFNα2) protein, a pivotal member of the type I interferon family, which plays a significant role in the body's innate immune response. As a cytokine, IFNα2 is involved in antiviral defense, immunomodulation, and inhibition of cell proliferation. The protein is characterized by a helical structure, comprising five alpha-helices and stabilized by two disulfide bonds, which is typical of the helical cytokine family (Paul2015IFNA2:; Wittling2021Shared). IFNα2 exerts its biological effects by binding to specific cell surface receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, forming a ternary complex that activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This activation leads to the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which mediate a wide range of antiviral activities (Paul2015IFNA2:). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and severe malarial anemia, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Kempaiah2012Reduced; Feng2013Bioinformatics).

## Structure
The IFNA2 gene encodes the interferon alpha 2 (IFNα2) protein, which is a key member of the type I interferon family. The primary structure of IFNα2 consists of 188 amino acids, including a 23 amino acid N-terminal leader sequence that is cleaved during secretion, resulting in a mature protein of 165 amino acids (Paul2015IFNA2:). The secondary structure of IFNα2 is characterized by five alpha-helices (A to E), forming a left-handed four-helix bundle, a common feature of the helical cytokine family (Paul2015IFNA2:; Wittling2021Shared).

The tertiary structure of IFNα2 has been elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, revealing a compact structure stabilized by two disulfide bonds: one linking the long loop between helix A and helix B to helix E, and another connecting the amino-terminal cysteine to position 98 in helix C (Paul2015IFNA2:). IFNα2 is not glycosylated, which facilitates its production in Escherichia coli for biopharmaceutical applications (Paul2015IFNA2:).

The quaternary structure involves the formation of a ternary complex with the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptor chains, essential for its biological activity. The interaction with IFNAR2 involves helices A and E and the A-B loop, while the interaction with IFNAR1 involves helices B, C, and D (Paul2015IFNA2:).

## Function
The IFNA2 gene encodes the interferon alpha 2 protein, a member of the type I interferon family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. IFNα2 is involved in establishing an antiviral state within cells, decreasing cell proliferation, and exerting immunomodulatory activities that impact both innate and adaptive immune responses (Paul2015IFNA2:). It activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by forming a ternary complex with the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptor chains, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and the formation of the ISGF3 transcription factor. This pathway induces the transcription of a large family of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are responsible for a broad spectrum of antiviral actions (Paul2015IFNA2:).

IFNα2 is not glycosylated, allowing for its production in Escherichia coli, and its structure includes five α-helices and two disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability and function (Paul2015IFNA2:). The protein is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it binds to specific receptors on cell surfaces, activating signaling pathways that enhance the expression of antiviral proteins. This activity helps inhibit viral replication and modulates the immune system by influencing the activity of immune cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages (Paul2015IFNA2:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IFNA2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of severe malarial anemia (SMA), specific haplotypes of the IFNA2 gene, such as the -173T variant, are linked to reduced production of interferon-alpha (IFN-α). This reduction in IFN-α levels is associated with an increased susceptibility to SMA and higher all-cause mortality in children from regions with holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission, such as western Kenya (Kempaiah2012Reduced).

The IFNA2 gene is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. Alterations in its expression can contribute to the pathogenesis of conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In SLE, increased levels of type I IFN-induced genes, including those regulated by IFNA2, are observed. This dysregulation is linked to the disease's characteristic immune response and inflammation (Feng2013Bioinformatics).

Furthermore, the regulation of IFNA2 expression can be influenced by epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and chromatin structure. These factors play a role in the gene's expression in autoimmune diseases and may affect the immune response to viral infections (Feng2013Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
The IFNA2 protein interacts with its receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, to form a ternary complex crucial for its function. In murine cells, IFNA2 forms a 185-kDa complex with IFN-␣/␤R and IFNAR, while in human Daudi cells, a similar complex exceeds 200 kDa due to a larger IFN-␣/␤R component (Cohen1995LigandInduced). IFNA2 binds IFNAR2 with nanomolar affinity, a common feature among cytokine receptors, and this interaction is essential for initiating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Piehler2012Structural).

Mutational analyses have identified key residues on IFNA2, such as L30 and R33, which form a hydrophobic patch contributing significantly to the interaction energy with IFNAR2 (Piehler1999Mutational). Electrostatic interactions, involving residues like K31, K131, and K133, are also crucial for the association rate constant, indicating their importance in steering the association with IFNAR2 (Piehler1999Mutational). The binding interface involves both long-range electrostatic forces and short-range interactions, with specific residues playing critical roles in binding affinity and stability (Piehler1999Mutational). These interactions are vital for the antiviral activity of IFNA2, as the binding affinity correlates with its antiviral potency (Piehler1999Mutational).
