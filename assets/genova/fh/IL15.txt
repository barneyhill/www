# IL15

## Overview
Interleukin 15 (IL15) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 15, which is a crucial component of the immune system. This cytokine is categorized as a short-chain helical cytokine and is involved in the regulation and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, playing a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The IL15 gene is expressed in various tissues and is particularly active in bone marrow stromal cells and activated monocytes, indicating its widespread role in immune regulation (Carson1997A). The protein interleukin 15 interacts with a specific receptor complex, including IL-15Rα, IL-2/15Rβ, and the common gamma chain (γc), to mediate its effects on immune cells (Han2011IL15:IL15). Due to its significant role in immune cell proliferation and survival, IL15 is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (AllardChamard2020Interleukin15; Mishra2016Mechanism).

## Structure
Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a cytokine with a polypeptide chain consisting of 114 amino acids. Its secondary structure is characterized by a four-helix bundle with an 'up-up-down-down' topology, typical of short-chain helical cytokines (Chirifu2007Crystal). The tertiary structure of IL-15 includes two disulfide bonds, with the Cys42-Cys88 pair being unique among small, four-helix-bundle cytokines, contributing to the stabilization of the IL-15Ra-binding surface (Chirifu2007Crystal). 

In terms of quaternary structure, IL-15 forms a high-affinity complex with its receptor IL-15Ra, which features a sushi domain with an ABCC’DE topology. This domain is similar to the amino-terminal sushi domain of the decay-accelerating factor and the carboxy-terminal, IL-2-nonbinding sushi domain of IL-2Ra (Chirifu2007Crystal). The IL-15-IL-15Ra complex is noted for its high affinity, which is stabilized by charge-charge and van der Waals interactions, as well as an extensive water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network (Chirifu2007Crystal). The complex's stability is further enhanced by geometric and electrostatic complementarity, with water molecules playing a crucial role in stabilizing the interaction (Chirifu2007Crystal).

## Function
Interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a cytokine that plays a critical role in the immune system, particularly in the development, survival, and function of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. IL-15 is involved in the proliferation and activation of NK cells, enhancing their cytotoxicity and cytokine production, which are essential for the innate immune response (Carson1994Interleukin; Fehniger2001Interleukin). It acts as a growth factor for T cells, inducing the migration and proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and can substitute for interleukin-2 (IL-2) in inducing cytotoxic activity in T cells and NK cells (Kennedy1996Characterization).

IL-15 is crucial for the survival of NK cells, preventing apoptosis and maintaining Bcl-2 protein levels, which are vital for cell survival (Carson1997A). It also plays a significant role in the development of NK cells, as evidenced by studies showing that the absence of IL-15 leads to a lack of mature NK cells, which can be reversed by administering exogenous IL-15 (Fehniger2001Interleukin).

IL-15 is expressed in various tissues and is produced by bone marrow stromal cells and activated monocytes, suggesting its widespread role in immune regulation (Carson1997A). It is active in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface, where it interacts with specific receptors to mediate its effects (Fehniger2001Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 15 (IL15) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), IL15 is overexpressed in neoplastic T-cells, contributing to disease progression by promoting the proliferation and survival of malignant CD4+ T-cells. This overexpression is linked to epigenetic changes, such as promoter hypermethylation, which prevent the transcriptional repressor Zeb1 from binding to the IL15 regulatory region (Mishra2016Mechanism). IL15 also induces the expression of histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC6), which are involved in the pathogenesis of CTCL by regulating gene expression and promoting T-cell migration (Mishra2016Mechanism).

In autoimmune diseases, IL15 is implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). In RA, IL15 is found in elevated levels in the synovial membrane, correlating with disease activity and promoting inflammation by inducing TNFα production (AllardChamard2020Interleukin15). In T1D, IL15 supports the activation and survival of autoreactive CD8+ T-cells, contributing to the destruction of insulin-producing β cells (AllardChamard2020Interleukin15). These findings highlight IL15 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
Interleukin 15 (IL-15) interacts with its specific receptor complex, which includes the IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Rα), IL-2/15Rβ, and the common gamma chain (γc). IL-15 binds with high affinity to IL-15Rα, a process characterized by a network of ionic interactions involving specific residues on both IL-15 and IL-15Rα (Lorenzen2006The). This interaction is crucial for the cytokine's function, as it facilitates the presentation of IL-15 to the IL-15Rβγc complex on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (Han2011IL15:IL15).

The IL-15/IL-15Rα complex can exist in a soluble form, which enhances IL-15's biological activity by preventing its degradation and extending its half-life. This complex formation can convert IL-15 into a superagonist, significantly boosting its stimulatory effects on immune cells (Rubinstein2006Converting). The soluble IL-15/IL-15Rα complex is more effective in promoting the proliferation of memory-phenotype CD8+ T cells and NK cells compared to IL-15 alone (Rubinstein2006Converting).

IL-15's interaction with IL-15Rα is also essential for its secretion and transport through the secretory pathway, as the complex facilitates IL-15's passage through the Golgi apparatus and its expression on the cell surface (Duitman2008How).
