# METTL17

## Overview
METTL17 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase-like 17, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial function. The METTL17 protein is categorized as a mitochondrial matrix protein and plays a critical role in mitochondrial translation and ribosome assembly. It functions as an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster checkpoint, ensuring that mitochondrial translation proceeds only when Fe-S cluster levels are adequate, which is essential for the synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Structurally, METTL17 contains a putative Fe-S cluster binding motif and a Rossmann-fold methyltransferase domain, although its methylation function is not conserved. The protein's interaction with the mitoribosomal small subunit and its role in stabilizing the mitoribosome highlight its importance in cellular energy production and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Ast2022METTL17; Du2015Methyltransferase‐like).

## Structure
The METTL17 protein is characterized by a putative Fe-S cluster binding motif, essential for its function. It contains four conserved cysteine residues and a tyrosine residue forming part of an 'LYR' motif, which are involved in metal binding. The protein harbors an [Fe4S4]2+ cluster, coordinated by cysteine residues C333, C339, C347, and C404, crucial for its role in mitochondrial translation (Ast2022METTL17).

Structurally, METTL17 comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD) with a Rossmann-fold methyltransferase domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD) with a unique fold. The presence of a SAM motif, although disrupted, suggests that methylation is not a conserved function (Ast2022METTL17). The protein's structure includes a SAM-binding ability, which is essential for its function in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and RNA modification (Lv2024Structural).

The METTL17 protein is involved in the stabilization of the mitoribosomal small subunit (SSU) and facilitates the opening of the tRNA binding cleft through conformational changes in the rRNA (Ast2022METTL17). It acts as an Fe-S cluster checkpoint, ensuring mitochondrial translation proceeds only when Fe-S cluster levels are sufficient (Ast2022METTL17).

## Function
METTL17 is a mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation and ribosome assembly. It functions as an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster checkpoint, ensuring that mitochondrial translation proceeds only when Fe-S cluster levels are sufficient. This regulatory role is vital for the synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins, which are essential for cellular energy production (Ast2022METTL17).

METTL17 contains a [Fe4S4]2+ cluster, coordinated by specific cysteine residues, which stabilizes its binding to the mitoribosomal small subunit (SSU) and prevents premature monosome formation. This stabilization is critical for the early stages of mitochondrial translation and the proper assembly of the mitoribosome (Ast2022METTL17). The protein's interaction with the 12S rRNA of the mitoribosomal head is dependent on conserved motifs, highlighting its role in supporting mitochondrial translation and SSU activity (Ast2022METTL17).

In healthy human cells, METTL17 is essential for maintaining robust mitochondrial translation and bioenergetic functions. Its depletion leads to significant mitochondrial translation defects and respiratory chain deficiencies, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Ast2022METTL17).

## Clinical Significance
METTL17 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function and translation. Alterations in METTL17 expression can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting energy metabolism and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In colorectal cancer, suppression of METTL17 expression has been shown to disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to increased lipid peroxidation and impaired translation of mitochondrial protein-coding genes, which may contribute to cancer progression (Zhang2024METTL).

In the context of Friedreich's ataxia, a mitochondrial disease caused by the depletion of frataxin (FXN), METTL17 plays a crucial role. The loss of FXN leads to a reduction in Fe-S cluster-containing proteins, impairing mitochondrial translation. METTL17 acts as an Fe-S cluster checkpoint, and its activity is diminished in FXN-deficient cells, contributing to mitochondrial translation defects. Overexpression of METTL17 can rescue these defects, although it does not improve cellular growth, highlighting its potential therapeutic implications for conditions like Friedreich's ataxia and other oxidative phosphorylation disorders (Ast2022METTL17). Despite these associations, specific diseases directly linked to METTL17 mutations or expression alterations are not extensively detailed in the current literature.

## Interactions
METTL17 is known to interact with estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, acting as a coactivator that enhances their transcriptional activity. This interaction involves the activation function-1 (AF1) and AF2 domains of the estrogen receptors. The binding of METTL17 to these receptors has been confirmed through various experimental techniques, including Western blotting, GST pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions occur both in vitro and in vivo and are not influenced by the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2) (Du2015Methyltransferase‐like).

In the context of mitochondrial function, METTL17 interacts with the mitoribosomal small subunit (SSU) and is involved in the assembly of the mitoribosome. It binds to the rRNA of the mitoribosomal head, preventing premature monosome formation. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial translation and is dependent on the presence of an [Fe4S4]2+ cluster within METTL17, which stabilizes its structure and function (Ast2022METTL17). METTL17's interaction with the mitoribosome is mutually exclusive with the mitochondrial initiation factor 3 (mtIF3), indicating a regulatory role in translation initiation (Ast2022METTL17).
