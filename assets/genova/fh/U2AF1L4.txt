# U2AF1L4

## Overview
U2AF1L4 is a gene that encodes the U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 like 4 protein, which is primarily involved in the RNA splicing process. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and plays a crucial role in the recognition of splice sites during the splicing of pre-mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA maturation and stability. U2AF1L4 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the alternative splicing of specific genes, such as the CD45 molecule, which is important for T cell activation and differentiation (Khaziakhmatova2018The). Additionally, U2AF1L4 is implicated in translation regulation, particularly in activated T cells, suggesting its involvement in broader gene expression processes (Herdt2020The). Despite its established roles, the specific functions of U2AF1L4 in healthy human cells remain an area of ongoing research (Han2022Construction).

## Structure


## Function
U2AF1L4 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. The protein is similar to U2AF1 and is likely involved in the recognition of splice sites during the splicing of pre-mRNA, influencing mRNA maturation and stability. U2AF1L4 is active in the nucleus, where splicing occurs, and plays a role in the alternative splicing of the CD45 molecule, particularly in T cell activation and differentiation. This process involves the exclusion of exon 4, leading to the formation of the CD45RO isoform, which is crucial for the immune response (Khaziakhmatova2018The).

In addition to its role in splicing, U2AF1L4 is implicated in translation regulation. The cytoplasmic variant of U2AF26, a paralog of U2AF1L4, is upregulated in activated T cells and is involved in activating translation, suggesting a role in cytoplasmic gene expression processes (Herdt2020The). U2AF1L4 has also been identified as a shear factor essential for protein synthesis, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear (Han2022Construction). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its significance in cell biology and its potential impact on organismal outcomes.
