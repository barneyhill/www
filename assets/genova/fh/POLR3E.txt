# POLR3E

## Overview
The POLR3E gene encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit E, a critical component of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex, which is responsible for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including 5S rRNA and tRNA, in eukaryotic cells (Ramanathan2020A). This subunit plays a pivotal role in the formation of open promoter complexes, transcription termination, and reinitiation, and is essential for the proper assembly and function of Pol III initiation complexes (Ramanathan2020A). POLR3E is also involved in the innate immune response, as it participates in the detection of viral DNA, leading to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs), which are crucial for antiviral defense (Jarrous2021RNA). Mutations in POLR3E have been associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections and impaired immune responses, underscoring its clinical significance in immune function (CarterTimofte2018Mutations; Ramanathan2020A).

## Function
The POLR3E gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which is essential for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNA, in eukaryotic cells (Ramanathan2020A). This subunit is part of a subcomplex near the polymerase's active center, playing a critical role in the formation of open promoter complexes, termination, and reinitiation of transcription (Ramanathan2020A). POLR3E is involved in the transcription of synthetic DNA templates, which can activate immune responses, highlighting its role in the innate immune system by sensing viral DNA and inducing type I interferons (IFNs) (Jarrous2021RNA; Ramanathan2020A).

In healthy human cells, POLR3E is crucial for the proper assembly and function of Pol III initiation complexes, which are necessary for efficient transcription of small RNA genes (Ramanathan2020A). The subunit is active in the nucleoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of transcription and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Ramanathan2020A). POLR3E's role in the immune response is underscored by its involvement in sensing both DNA and RNA viruses, leading to the induction of type I IFNs, which are vital for antiviral defense (Jarrous2021RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3E gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to viral infections and impaired immune responses. A rare homozygous mutation, D40H, in POLR3E has been identified in a child with recurrent viral infections and Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH). This mutation impairs the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and increases susceptibility to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, suggesting a connection to innate immune deficiency (Ramanathan2020A). The D40H mutation affects the assembly of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription complexes, leading to defective initiation complexes and reduced transcriptional activity, which are crucial for mounting an effective antiviral response (Ramanathan2020A).

In adults, a T275M mutation in POLR3E has been associated with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) central nervous system infections. This mutation is linked to impaired immune responses to the POL III agonist Poly(dA:dT), leading to increased VZV replication and suggesting a role in DNA sensing and signaling (CarterTimofte2018Mutations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of POLR3E mutations in contributing to immune deficiencies and increased vulnerability to viral infections.

## Interactions
POLR3E, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, is involved in forming initiation complexes necessary for transcription. It interacts with other subunits within the RNA polymerase III complex, notably forming a dimer with POLR3D (also known as RPC4), which resembles the transcription factor TFIIF. This interaction is crucial for promoter opening and transcription initiation (Yeganeh2017Transcriptional). The D40H mutation in POLR3E affects its interaction with RPC4, leading to the formation of defective initiation complexes that impair transcriptional activity (Ramanathan2020A).

The POLR3E subunit is also involved in the response to viral and nonviral nucleic acids, with its expression being induced by these elements. This induction activates RNA polymerase III transcription, suggesting a role in the antiviral immune response (Ramanathan2020A). The mutation in POLR3E results in impaired induction of type I interferons, which are critical for antiviral defense, highlighting its role in innate immunity (Ramanathan2020A).

Additionally, POLR3E is subject to transcriptional interference by a MIR antisense Pol III transcription unit, which can decrease its expression by creating a roadblock within the Polr3e Pol II transcription unit (Yeganeh2017Transcriptional).
