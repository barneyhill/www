# OR6B1

## Overview
The OR6B1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily B member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptor proteins, including the one encoded by OR6B1, play a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among GPCRs, allowing them to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins (Qiu2020aarFDC).
