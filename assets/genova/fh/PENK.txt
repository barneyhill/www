# PENK

## Overview
The PENK gene encodes the precursor protein proenkephalin, which is classified as a precursor protein due to its role in generating active opioid peptides. These peptides, including Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin, are involved in modulating various physiological processes such as pain perception, stress response, and immune function. Proenkephalin undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which are crucial for its processing and function. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, skin, and bone, where it plays roles in local homeostasis, antimicrobial defense, and bone remodeling. Additionally, PENK is involved in apoptosis regulation through interactions with key transcription factors, highlighting its importance in cellular stress responses and potential implications in disease pathogenesis (Slominski2011Regulated; McTavish2007Proenkephalin; Bojnik2014Bioactivity).

## Structure
The human PENK gene encodes the proenkephalin protein, which is a precursor to several opioid peptides, including Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin. The primary structure of proenkephalin includes multiple enkephalin sequences, which are cleaved to produce active peptides (Bojnik2014Bioactivity). The protein's structure is characterized by an N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a cysteine-rich domain, which are important for its processing and function (Bojnik2014Bioactivity).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the function of proenkephalin. Phosphorylation is a common modification, particularly at serine residues, which influences the protein's activity and processing. These modifications are crucial for the accessibility of cleavage sites and the regulation of intracellular biochemical mechanisms (Goumon1996The; Goumon1998Characterization). The phosphorylation of serine residues, such as Ser221 and Ser223, is essential for the antibacterial activity of certain proenkephalin-derived peptides (Goumon1996The).

The tertiary structure of proenkephalin-derived peptides, such as enkelytin, is influenced by phosphorylation, which can induce conformational changes through electrostatic interactions. These changes are important for the peptide's antibacterial properties (Goumon1998Characterization). The presence of proline residues also contributes to conformational changes through cis-trans isomerization, affecting the peptide's structure and function (Goumon1998Characterization).

## Function
Proenkephalin (PENK) is a precursor protein that is processed to produce enkephalins, which are opioid peptides involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, PENK-derived peptides, such as Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin, play a significant role in the neuroendocrine system, contributing to local and central homeostasis by modulating pain perception, stress response, and immune function (Slominski2011Regulated).

In the skin, PENK expression is prominent in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, where it is upregulated by environmental stressors like UV radiation. These peptides are involved in maintaining local homeostasis and providing an antimicrobial barrier, protecting deeper skin layers from microbial invasion (Slominski2011Regulated). PENK-derived peptides are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes and the outer root sheath of hair follicles, suggesting a role in cell differentiation and local signaling (Slominski2011Regulated).

In bone tissues, PENK is expressed in osteoblastic cells and is involved in bone development and remodeling. It influences osteoblast physiology by affecting alkaline phosphatase activity, which is crucial for bone mineralization (Seitz2010Preproenkephalin; Rosen1994Dual). These peptides may act in an autocrine or paracrine manner, modulating bone cell maturation and potentially interacting with other cell types like osteoclasts and fibroblasts (Rosen1994Dual).

## Clinical Significance
The PENK gene, encoding proenkephalin, has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In meningiomas, a type of brain tumor, PENK is involved in stress-induced apoptosis by interacting with p53 and RELA (p65), suggesting its role in the epigenetically-mediated oncogenesis of these tumors (Galani2017Genetic). 

In colorectal cancer, aberrant methylation of the PENK gene has been identified as a potential biomarker for diagnosis. Studies have shown that PENK, along with other genes like NPY and WIF1, exhibits significant hypermethylation in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This methylation pattern can be detected in both tissue and serum samples, offering a non-invasive diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity (Roperch2013Aberrant).

In the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), PENK has been identified as a crucial node in a module network, indicating its potential significance in the disease's pathogenesis. However, specific details on PENK gene mutations or expression alterations in DCM are not provided (Zhuang2017Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
Proenkephalin (PENK) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in apoptosis regulation. PENK interacts with the transcription factors p53 and the RelA(p65) subunit of NF-kB, enhancing apoptosis through these interactions. It can form a complex with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), acting as a transcriptional repressor of antiapoptotic genes regulated by NF-kB and p53. This repression is essential for promoting apoptosis in response to stressors like UV-C irradiation and hydrogen peroxide (McTavish2007Proenkephalin).

PENK also competes with p53 for binding to the transcriptional coactivator p300, indicating a role in modulating transcriptional activity. This interaction is part of a broader transcriptional cross-talk between the p53 and NF-kB pathways, where PENK can influence the outcome of NF-kB activation, potentially shifting it towards a pro-apoptotic response (McTavish2007Proenkephalin).

In astroglial cells, PENK expression is regulated by protein kinases A and C, which act synergistically to enhance PENK mRNA levels. This regulation involves different transcription factors, suggesting that PENK may interact with proteins such as jun D, fos, or CREB to modulate gene expression (Theodoridu1994Interaction).
