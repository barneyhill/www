# TIPARP

## Overview
TIPARP, or TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, specifically categorized as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme. The protein, also known as PARP7, plays a significant role in cellular processes by regulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway through mono-ADP-ribosylation. This post-translational modification is crucial for maintaining immune cell homeostasis and modulating inflammation. TIPARP is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the transcriptional activity of AHR and other nuclear receptors. The protein's ability to modify itself and other proteins, such as core histones, underscores its importance in cellular responses to environmental toxins like TCDD. Alterations in TIPARP expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and glaucoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gomez2018Characterization; Zhang2022TIPARP; Hutin20212).

## Structure
TIPARP, also known as TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, is a member of the PARP family characterized by several distinct domains. The protein contains a CCCH-type zinc finger domain, a WWE domain, and a C-terminal PARP catalytic region (Gomez2018Characterization). The zinc finger domain is crucial for its nuclear localization and function, as it helps TIPARP bind viral and cytoplasmic RNAs and is involved in regulating viral replication (Gomez2018Characterization). The WWE domain is part of a larger compact arrangement called MZAP, which includes the CCCH-type ZnF and two WWE domains, forming a compact assembly with the ART domain (Suskiewicz2023Updated).

TIPARP exhibits mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, capable of mono-ADP-ribosylating itself and other proteins, such as core histones and receptors like LXR and AHR (Gomez2018Characterization). The protein predominantly localizes in the nucleus but can translocate to the cytosol in response to certain stimuli (Gomez2018Characterization). TIPARP's catalytic activity is resistant to meta-iodobenzylguanidine but sensitive to iodoacetamide and hydroxylamine, implicating cysteines and acidic side chains as ADP-ribosylated target residues (Gomez2018Characterization). The protein's ability to repress AHR activity depends on its MARylation activity (Gomez2018Characterization).

## Function
TIPARP, also known as PARP7, is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, TIPARP functions as a negative regulator of AHR activity, which is important for maintaining immune cell homeostasis and modulating inflammation. This regulation is achieved through the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of AHR, which is dependent on TIPARP's catalytic activity (Gomez2018Characterization; Hutin20212).

TIPARP is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. It modifies itself and other proteins, such as core histones and transcription factors, through mono-ADP-ribosylation. This activity is crucial for controlling the transcriptional activity of AHR and other nuclear receptors, thereby influencing cellular responses to environmental toxins like TCDD (Gomez2018Characterization).

The loss of TIPARP's catalytic activity can lead to increased sensitivity to TCDD-induced toxicities, such as steatohepatitis and hepatotoxicity, highlighting its protective role against environmental toxins (Hutin20212). TIPARP's enzymatic activity and its ability to modify AHR are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive AHR signaling (Gomez2018Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TIPARP gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and glaucoma. In breast cancer, TIPARP expression is lower in advanced stages and is associated with longer survival outcomes. Its expression is positively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, and negatively correlated with basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) status. DNA methylation is suggested as a mechanism for TIPARP dysregulation in breast cancer, and its interactors are enriched in pathways related to telomere maintenance and cancer, indicating a role in cell growth regulation (TCDDInducible; p&gt; Lin2019&lt).

In male papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), TIPARP expression is upregulated in patients with lymph node metastasis, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker. It correlates with immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in the tumor immune microenvironment and potential implications for immunotherapy (Zhang2024TIPARP).

In the context of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), TIPARP is upregulated in the trabecular meshwork and blood of patients, suggesting its involvement in intraocular pressure regulation. Alterations in TIPARP expression can lead to increased extracellular matrix deposition and cell adhesion, contributing to elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma pathogenesis (Zhang2022TIPARP).

## Interactions
TIPARP, also known as TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. TIPARP interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), repressing its activity through mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification. This interaction is significant for regulating AHR signaling pathways (Gomez2018Characterization). TIPARP also interacts with itself, forming complexes with other TIPARP molecules, which can lead to trans-modification, where one TIPARP molecule modifies another (Gomez2018Characterization).

In the context of breast cancer, TIPARP is co-expressed with several interactors, including PARP16, PINX1, HABP4, CYP1A1, PARP3, CYP1B1, IGDCC3, AHR, PARP6, and INMT. These interactions are involved in responses to xenobiotic stimuli and cancer pathways, highlighting TIPARP's potential role in cancer biology (TCDDInducible; p&gt; Lin2019&lt).

TIPARP's interactions extend to its role in regulating intraocular pressure, where it influences extracellular matrix components and cell-ECM adhesion, crucial for trabecular meshwork function (Zhang2022TIPARP). These interactions underscore TIPARP's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.
