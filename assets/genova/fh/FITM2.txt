# FITM2

## Overview
FITM2, or fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein integral to lipid metabolism and storage within human cells. The FITM2 protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a pivotal role in the formation and regulation of lipid droplets, which are essential for triglyceride storage. Structurally, FITM2 is characterized by six transmembrane domains and a conserved 'FIT signature sequence' crucial for its function in lipid partitioning (Gross2010Structural). Functionally, FITM2 is involved in the lipidation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and possesses acyl-CoA diphosphatase activity, contributing to ER homeostasis and energy metabolism (Ho2024Role; Wang2023FITM2). The protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and responding to metabolic stress. Clinically, mutations in the FITM2 gene are linked to conditions such as Siddiqi syndrome and have implications in metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (Shakir2018The; Ho2024Role).

## Structure
FITM2, also known as fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2, is characterized by its integration into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane through six transmembrane domains. Both the N- and C-termini of FITM2 are oriented towards the cytosol, and it features a large second luminal loop (Gross2010Structural). The protein contains a conserved sequence in transmembrane domain 4, known as the 'FIT signature sequence,' which is crucial for its function in triglyceride partitioning into lipid droplets (Gross2010Structural).

FITM2 is a lipid phosphate phosphatase, sharing structural similarities with lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP enzymes). It possesses conserved catalytic residues, including two histidines in the C2 and C3 motifs, essential for its enzymatic activity. These motifs are positioned at the interface between the inner ER membrane leaflet and the ER lumen (Becuwe2018FIT2). FITM2 lacks the C1 domain found in most LPP enzymes, which is typically involved in substrate recognition (Becuwe2018FIT2).

The protein is involved in lipid droplet formation and ER homeostasis, and its activity is crucial for maintaining normal ER morphology. FITM2's enzymatic function involves hydrolyzing lipid phosphates like phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid (Becuwe2018FIT2).

## Function
FITM2, or fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2, is integral to lipid droplet (LD) formation and lipid metabolism in human cells. It is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it facilitates the accumulation and storage of triglycerides (TGs) within lipid droplets. FITM2 plays a crucial role in the nucleation and budding of lipid droplets by concentrating triacylglycerols (TAGs) between the ER leaflets, promoting the formation of an oil lens structure that leads to LD emergence (Wang2022Fat). 

FITM2 is involved in the lipidation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles in the liver, a process essential for the proper secretion of VLDL from hepatic cells. It functions after the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) step, ensuring the transfer of TGs to nascent VLDL particles (Wang2023FITM2). The protein also possesses acyl-CoA diphosphatase activity, which helps maintain ER homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of fatty-acyl CoA within the ER lumen (Ho2024Role). 

FITM2's activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and normal metabolic function, as it influences fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, and ATP levels in muscle tissue (Wang2022Fat). Its role in lipid droplet biology is significant for metabolic health, affecting the differentiation of preadipocytes and the functionality of adipose tissue (Wang2022Fat).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FITM2 gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. Siddiqi syndrome, also known as deafness-dystonia syndrome, is linked to biallelic loss-of-function variants in FITM2. This syndrome is characterized by severe developmental delay, dystonia, limb contractures, and progressive bilateral sensorineural deafness. It follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and was first identified in a consanguineous Pakistani family. Affected individuals exhibit progressive hearing loss, dystonic limb movements, neuropathic pain, and ichthyosis-like skin findings (Shakir2018The).

In mice, the global deletion of FITM2 results in embryonic lethality, while postnatal deletion leads to lethal enteropathy due to the destruction of intestinal villi and crypts, disrupting lipid absorption. This highlights the gene's critical role in maintaining intestinal health (Goh2015Postnatal). Additionally, FITM2 is implicated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with decreased levels observed in the adipose tissues of T2DM subjects. Its knockdown in adipose cells increases endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, suggesting a role in T2DM pathogenesis through mechanisms involving ER stress and lipid droplet generation (Ho2024Role).

## Interactions
FITM2 interacts with several proteins involved in lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism. It physically interacts with the cytoskeletal protein Septin7 and ER tubule-forming proteins Rtn4 and REEP5 during the formation of nascent lipid droplets. These interactions are crucial for the nucleation and budding steps of lipid droplet biogenesis, as the depletion of these proteins delays lipid droplet formation (Wang2022Fat).

FITM2 also interacts with the ERAD machinery protein p97, which is involved in the extraction and degradation of ubiquitinylated FITM2. This interaction is significant in the context of FITM2 degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, particularly under conditions of palmitate exposure (Ho2024Role). The E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 is another protein that interacts with FITM2, playing a role in its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Ho2024Role).

These interactions highlight FITM2's role in lipid metabolism and its regulation through various protein interactions, which are essential for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and responding to metabolic stress.
