# ACAT1

## Overview
The ACAT1 gene encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in ketogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase and is essential for the conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA, a critical step in the synthesis of ketone bodies. Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 is characterized by its tetrameric quaternary structure, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and is regulated by phosphorylation events (Fan2016Tetrameric). The enzyme is involved in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by facilitating the formation of cholesteryl esters, which are vital for lipid transport and storage (Chang1998Recombinant; Lin1999Human). Mutations in the ACAT1 gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiency, underscoring its clinical significance (Abdelkreem2019Mutation).

## Structure
The ACAT1 protein, also known as acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in ketogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. It is characterized by a tetrameric quaternary structure, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The tetramer formation is stabilized by phosphorylation, particularly at the Y407 residue, which is essential for its activation in cancer cells (Fan2016Tetrameric). 

ACAT1 consists of multiple transmembrane domains, with studies suggesting it has eight transmembrane domains, both the amino and carboxy termini located in the cytoplasm (Joyce2000ACAT1). The enzyme's active site includes a critical serine residue, Ser 269, located in the cytosol, which is essential for its activity (Joyce2000ACAT1). 

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its oligomerization state and activity. Phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases like EGFR and FGFR1 promotes the formation of active tetramers, enhancing its role in cancer cell metabolism (Fan2016Tetrameric). 

ACAT1's structure and function are distinct from ACAT2, another enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism, highlighting the specificity of ACAT1 in maintaining intracellular cholesterol balance (Joyce2000ACAT1).

## Function
The ACAT1 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis in human cells. ACAT-1 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the conversion of free cholesterol and long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A into cholesteryl esters. This process is essential for the storage of cholesterol in cytoplasmic lipid droplets, thereby maintaining cholesterol balance within cells (Chang1998Recombinant; Lin1999Human).

ACAT-1 is active in various tissues, including the liver, adrenal glands, and macrophages, where it contributes to the formation of cholesteryl esters, which are components of lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoproteins and chylomicrons. These lipoproteins are crucial for lipid transport in the bloodstream (Lin1999Human). The enzyme's activity is allosterically regulated by cholesterol, and its function is vital for preventing the accumulation of free cholesterol, which can lead to cellular toxicity (Chang1998Recombinant; Joyce2000ACAT1).

In macrophages, ACAT-1 is implicated in foam cell formation, a key event in the development of atherosclerosis, highlighting its role in both normal physiology and disease processes (Lin1999Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACAT1 gene are primarily associated with mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2) deficiency, also known as beta-ketothiolase deficiency. This autosomal recessive disorder affects the metabolism of isoleucine and ketone bodies, leading to episodic ketoacidosis, which can manifest between 6 and 18 months of age. Symptoms include severe metabolic acidosis, encephalopathy, and potentially life-threatening episodes that may result in neurological impairments such as gait disturbances and mental retardation (Abdelkreem2017Two; Abdelkreem2019Mutation). 

The condition is characterized by the accumulation of isoleucine-derived metabolites, detectable in urine and blood, and is diagnosed through enzyme assays and genetic analysis (Abdelkreem2019Mutation). Over 105 ACAT1 variants have been identified, with common mutations such as c.622C>T and c.1006-1G>C leading to non-functional T2 proteins (Abdelkreem2019Mutation). The clinical severity varies, with some patients experiencing neurodevelopmental sequelae or fatal outcomes (Abdelkreem2016Clinical).

Alterations in ACAT1 expression or function may also be implicated in other conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, although these associations are less well-defined in the context provided.
