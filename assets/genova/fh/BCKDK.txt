# BCKDK

## Overview
The BCKDK gene encodes the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase, a crucial enzyme in the regulation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. As a kinase, BCKDK phosphorylates and inactivates the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), thereby controlling the catabolic pathway of BCAAs. This regulation is vital for maintaining amino acid homeostasis and ensuring their availability for protein synthesis and energy production (Oyarzabal2016Mitochondrial; Maguolo2022A). BCKDK is predominantly active in the mitochondria, where it also influences the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, highlighting its role in cellular metabolic balance (HeinemannYerushalmi2021BCKDK). The gene's mutations are linked to various neurological and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Du2022The; Novarino2012Mutations).

## Structure
The BCKDK (branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase) protein is an enzyme involved in the regulation of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the BCKDK gene. The secondary structure of BCKDK includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall three-dimensional conformation. The tertiary structure of BCKDK forms a specific three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its function, often involving kinase domains that are essential for its enzymatic activity.

BCKDK may also exhibit quaternary structure by forming dimers or higher-order oligomers, which are important for its functional regulation. The protein contains a regulatory domain with an allosteric inhibitory site, where various inhibitors can bind, affecting its activity and interaction with other proteins (Roth2023Small). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating BCKDK's activity, potentially altering its function and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of BCKDK may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The BCKDK gene encodes the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. BCKDK functions by phosphorylating and inactivating the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the BCAA catabolic pathway. This regulation is essential for maintaining BCAA homeostasis, preventing excessive degradation of BCAAs, and ensuring their availability for protein synthesis (Oyarzabal2016Mitochondrial; Maguolo2022A).

BCKDK is active in the mitochondria, where it modulates energy production and protein synthesis, impacting muscle function and metabolic health. It also regulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by phosphorylating it, acting as a backup mechanism for the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) family. This dual role highlights its importance in maintaining cellular metabolic balance, particularly during embryonic development (HeinemannYerushalmi2021BCKDK).

The activity of BCKDK is influenced by branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs), particularly ketoisocaproate (KIC), which inhibits the kinase to promote BCAA disposal when they are in excess. This mechanism ensures the conservation of essential amino acids when they are less available (Maguolo2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BCKDK gene are associated with several neurological and metabolic disorders. Inactivating mutations in BCKDK have been linked to a form of autism spectrum disorder accompanied by epilepsy and intellectual disability. These mutations result in decreased levels of BCKDK mRNA and protein, leading to reduced phosphorylation of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex and lower plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (Du2022The; Novarino2012Mutations). Patients with these mutations often exhibit developmental delays, microcephaly, and neurobehavioral abnormalities, which can be partially ameliorated with dietary BCAA supplementation (Oyarzabal2016Mitochondrial; Burrage2014Branchedchain).

Gain-of-function mutations in BCKDK, such as the p.His162Gln variant, have been identified in patients with a biochemical phenotype similar to Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), characterized by elevated plasma BCAA levels (Maguolo2022A). These mutations lead to excessive inhibition of the BCKDH complex, causing an accumulation of BCAAs (Maguolo2022A). The BCKDK gene is also implicated in metabolic pathways regulated by the ubiquitin ligase UBE3B, with disruptions leading to intellectual disability and absent speech (Cheon2019The).

## Interactions
BCKDK (branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in amino acid metabolism and cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, BCKDK interacts with the Src kinase, which phosphorylates BCKDK at the tyrosine 246 (Y246) site. This phosphorylation is crucial for cancer metastasis, and the interaction between BCKDK and Src has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating their physical association (Tian2020Phosphorylation).

In breast cancer, BCKDK interacts with talin1, a protein involved in cell adhesion. BCKDK competitively binds to talin1, disrupting its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. This interaction inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of talin1, leading to the activation of the FAK/MAPK signaling pathway, which promotes cell migration and metastasis (Xu2023BCKDK).

BCKDK also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase UBE3B, which ubiquitinates BCKDK, regulating its levels in tissues such as the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. This interaction is significant for maintaining branched-chain amino acid metabolism (Cheon2019The). These interactions highlight BCKDK's role in both metabolic regulation and cancer progression.
