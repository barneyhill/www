# ADNP

## Overview
The ADNP gene encodes the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in brain development and function. As a transcription factor, ADNP is involved in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression, particularly those genes essential for neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation (Sragovich2017ADNP; Mandel2007Activitydependent). The protein is characterized by its interaction with various chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SWI/SNF and ChAHP complexes, which are crucial for its function in neurodevelopment and synaptic processes (D’Incal2023Chromatin; Ostapcuk2018Activitydependent). ADNP's involvement in maintaining microtubule integrity and its regulation by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) further underscore its role in neuroprotection and cellular homeostasis (Zamostiano2001Cloning; Gozes2015ActivityDependent). Mutations in the ADNP gene are linked to Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome and have implications in other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (IvashkoPachima2019Discovery; Helsmoortel2014A).

## Structure
The ADNP protein is composed of 1102 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 124 kDa. Its primary structure includes several key domains: nine C2H2-type zinc fingers (amino acids 74-686), a DNA-binding homeobox domain (amino acids 754-814), and a glutaredoxin active site (amino acids 220-243) (D’Incal2023Chromatin; Zamostiano2001Cloning). The protein also features a nuclear localization signal (NLS) spanning amino acids 716-733, which facilitates its nuclear import (D’Incal2023Chromatin).

The ADNP protein interacts with various chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SWI/SNF and ChAHP complexes, through its N-terminus and C-terminus, indicating the presence of functional domains crucial for protein interactions (D’Incal2023Chromatin). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by the proximity of mutations near the homeobox domain, which suggests a role in chromatin-binding activity (D’Incal2023Chromatin).

ADNP undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Zamostiano2001Cloning). The protein is involved in neuroprotection and development, with its structure supporting interactions with various proteins and complexes essential for these functions (D’Incal2023Chromatin).

## Function
The activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a crucial gene involved in various molecular processes essential for brain development and function. In healthy human cells, ADNP plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It interacts with chromatin to regulate the expression of genes essential for embryogenesis and neuronal differentiation (Mandel2007Activitydependent). ADNP is involved in the regulation of over 400 genes during embryonic development and thousands postnatally, including those crucial for neurogenesis and autophagy (Sragovich2017ADNP).

ADNP interacts with microtubule end-binding proteins, such as EB1 and EB3, which are vital for maintaining microtubule integrity and dendritic spine formation, crucial for neuronal survival and function (Gozes2015ActivityDependent). It also interacts with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B), a key protein in autophagy, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis (Gozes2015ActivityDependent). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor, and is essential for neuronal differentiation and maintenance, influencing cognitive functions and development (Zamostiano2001Cloning). ADNP's regulation by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) further underscores its role in neuroprotection and brain metabolism (Zamostiano2001Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADNP gene are primarily associated with Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome (HVDAS), a complex neurological disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) features. Patients often exhibit moderate to severe intellectual disability, with 93% displaying autism or autistic features. Other symptoms include speech and motor delays, feeding and gastrointestinal issues, behavioral problems, visual impairments, sleep disturbances, and various physical abnormalities such as hand and foot deformities and dysmorphic facial features (D’Incal2023Chromatin; Helsmoortel2014A).

ADNP mutations are often de novo and include stopgain or frameshift mutations, leading to truncated proteins. Some mutations, particularly those in the fifth exon, may escape nonsense-mediated decay, potentially resulting in a gain of toxic function (Pescosolido2014Expansion; Helsmoortel2014A). The gene is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where somatic mutations in ADNP are linked to tauopathy, a hallmark of the disease (IvashkoPachima2019Discovery).

Alterations in ADNP expression levels have been observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in response to neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer's disease, increased ADNP mRNA levels are noted, although protein levels decrease, possibly due to mRNA destabilization (Sragovich2017ADNP). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
ADNP (activity dependent neuroprotector homeobox) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neurodevelopment and synaptic processes. The ADNP protein interacts with several components of the BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, which are the eukaryotic equivalent of the SWI/SNF complex in yeast. Specifically, the C-terminal part of ADNP directly interacts with ARID1A, SMARCA4, and SMARCC2, essential components of these complexes (Helsmoortel2014A). ADNP is also a key subunit of the ChAHP complex, which includes CHD4 and HP1β/γ, and is crucial for the complex's assembly and targeting to specific euchromatic sites in the genome (Ostapcuk2018Activitydependent).

ADNP interacts with heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), a protein involved in epigenetic regulation, through a conserved HP1α binding motif, suggesting a potential interaction (Mandel2007Activitydependent). Coimmunoprecipitation assays have shown that ADNP and HP1α co-interact in both differentiated and non-differentiated cells (Mandel2007Activitydependent). Additionally, ADNP has been shown to interact with SHANK3 through SH3- and actin-binding domains, indicating a shared mechanism underlying autism (IvashkoPachima2022SH3). These interactions highlight ADNP's role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation during neuronal differentiation and development.
