# BAK1

## Overview
BAK1 (BCL2 antagonist/killer 1) is a gene that encodes a pro-apoptotic protein belonging to the BCL-2 family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly through the intrinsic pathway. The BAK1 protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, a critical step in the apoptotic process. This permeabilization facilitates the release of cytochrome c, leading to the activation of caspases and the subsequent execution of apoptosis (Falah2016Expression; Soares2011Maitake). The protein functions by forming apoptotic pores in the mitochondrial membrane, often in collaboration with BAX, another pro-apoptotic protein, thereby destabilizing the membrane and promoting cell death (Falah2016Expression). The balance between BAK1 and anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2 is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the regulation of programmed cell death, influencing both normal development and disease pathogenesis (Falah2016Expression).

## Function
BAK1 (BCL2 antagonist/killer 1) is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family, playing a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. In healthy human cells, BAK1 is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it promotes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. This process is essential for the release of cytochrome c, which subsequently leads to the activation of caspases, the proteolytic enzymes that drive the apoptotic cascade (Falah2016Expression; Soares2011Maitake).

BAK1 functions by forming an apoptotic pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane, often in conjunction with another pro-apoptotic protein, BAX. This pore formation is a critical step in the initiation of apoptosis, as it destabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the release of apoptogenic factors (Falah2016Expression). The carboxyl terminus of BAK1 is particularly important in this process, as it either lines the pore or aggregates on the membrane surface, contributing to membrane destabilization (Falah2016Expression).

The balance between BAK1 and anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL2 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis. This balance determines whether a cell will undergo apoptosis or survive, thus playing a significant role in organismal development and the regulation of programmed cell death (Falah2016Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BAK1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and other conditions involving disrupted apoptotic processes. In intracranial germ cell tumors (IGCTs), a deletion polymorphism near the BAK1 gene, specifically the variant rs3831846, has been associated with increased disease risk. This variant reduces enhancer activity, leading to decreased BAK1 expression, which may allow mis-migrated primordial germ cells to evade apoptosis and potentially form germ cell tumors (Sonehara2022A). The same genetic variant is also linked to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), suggesting a shared genetic susceptibility between IGCTs and TGCTs (Sonehara2022A).

In the context of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BAK1 gene have been identified in aortic tissue from AAA patients. These SNPs, which are rare in reference databases, may contribute to the disease by increasing apoptosis, although their presence in both diseased and nondiseased tissues complicates their direct association with AAA (Gottlieb2009BAK1). These findings highlight the complex role of BAK1 in disease development, particularly through its influence on apoptotic pathways.
