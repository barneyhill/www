# SEC31A

## Overview
SEC31A is a gene that encodes the SEC31 homolog A, a crucial component of the Coat Protein Complex II (COPII) involved in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. The SEC31A protein is integral to the formation and function of the COPII coat, facilitating the proper folding and trafficking of proteins necessary for cellular homeostasis. It is characterized by multiple domains, including an N-terminal WD40 repeat domain and a Pro-rich region, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and its role in vesicle formation. The protein's interaction with the Ca2+-binding protein ALG-2 is calcium-dependent and critical for its localization at ER exit sites. Mutations in SEC31A have been linked to severe neurological syndromes and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Yamasaki2006The; Yong2021Cancerdriving; Halperin2018SEC31A).

## Structure
The SEC31A protein is a component of the COPII coat complex, essential for vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It is composed of 1220 amino acids and is highly conserved across species (Halperin2018SEC31A). The protein structure includes multiple domains, such as the N-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which spans amino acids 1-322, and a Pro-rich region located between amino acids 808-1145 (Yamasaki2006The). The WD40 repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for the assembly and function of the COPII coat (Halperin2018SEC31A).

The Pro-rich region of SEC31A is significant for its interaction with the Ca2+-binding protein ALG-2, which binds in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Yamasaki2006The). This interaction is mediated by a specific sequence (839-851) within the Pro-rich region, forming left-handed type II polyproline helices (Shibata2019Adaptor). SEC31A also contains a C-terminal region that contributes to its structural integrity and function within the COPII complex (Yamasaki2006The).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEC31A interacts with SEC13, forming a heterotetramer that is part of the outer layer of the COPII coat (Hutchings2020Structure). This interaction is vital for the stability and adaptability of the coat, allowing it to accommodate various cargo sizes and shapes (Hutchings2020Structure).

## Function
The SEC31A gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Coat Protein Complex II (COPII), which is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus in cells. This process is vital for maintaining ER homeostasis and proper protein trafficking, which are necessary for normal cellular function (Halperin2018SEC31A). SEC31A is part of the SEC13-SEC31A heterotetramer, which plays a key role in the final steps of vesicle formation by promoting coat polymerization, membrane curvature, and membrane fission, resulting in the formation of intact vesicles (Halperin2018SEC31A).

In healthy human cells, SEC31A is involved in the assembly of the COP-II complex, facilitating the proper folding and transport of proteins, which is crucial for ER homeostasis (Halperin2018SEC31A). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is associated with the protein encoded by SEC13, playing a critical role in ER-Golgi transport in the canonical COP-II secretion pathway (Halperin2018SEC31A). The interaction between SEC31A and the Ca2+-binding protein ALG-2 is calcium-dependent and is important for the localization and stabilization of SEC31A at ER exit sites, which are crucial for vesicle trafficking (Yamasaki2006The; Shibata2007ALG2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEC31A gene are associated with a severe neurological syndrome characterized by spastic quadriplegia, profound developmental delay, convulsions, severe hearing defects, and pseudobulbar palsy, which is typically lethal by the age of four. Affected individuals often exhibit microcephaly, semilobar holoprosencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral congenital cataracts, lack of ocular fixation, congenital horizontal nystagmus, flat retina, and optic atrophy. These symptoms are linked to an enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response due to the SEC31A mutation, which particularly affects the EDEM1 gene involved in ER-associated protein degradation (Halperin2018SEC31A).

In cancer, SEC31A mutations have been identified in chromosomal rearrangements and gene fusions, such as the SEC31A-ALK fusion in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and the SEC31A-JAK2 fusion in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. These fusions exhibit oncogenic properties, contributing to cancer progression. Additionally, increased levels of circ-SEC31A, a circular RNA derived from SEC31A, have been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it promotes tumor growth by sponging miR-376a, thereby regulating SEC31A expression (CircSEC31A; Yong2021Cancerdriving; Cheng2020&lt; p&gt).

## Interactions
SEC31A, a component of the COPII coat complex, interacts with the Ca2+-binding protein ALG-2 in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the localization of both proteins to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites. ALG-2 binds to the Pro-rich region of SEC31A, and this binding is necessary for the stable localization of SEC31A at these sites. The interaction is disrupted when calcium is chelated or when ALG-2 is mutated to prevent calcium binding, highlighting the calcium dependency of this interaction (Yamasaki2006The; Shibata2007ALG2).

SEC31A is also involved in forming a ternary complex with ALG-2 and annexin A11, a Ca2+-dependent membrane lipid-binding protein. This complex influences the dynamics of SEC31A at ER exit sites, linking calcium signaling to COPII function. Knockdown of annexin A11 results in decreased stability of SEC31A at the ER exit sites, similar to the effects observed with ALG-2 knockdown (Shibata2019Adaptor).

SEC31A can be modified by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), which reduces its ability to bind ALG-2 and accelerates ER-to-Golgi transport. This modification suggests a regulatory role for SEC31A in protein transport (Shibata2019Adaptor).
