# TEAD4

## Overview
TEAD4, or TEA domain transcription factor 4, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the TEAD family, which plays a pivotal role in the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The TEAD4 protein is characterized by its TEA DNA-binding domain and a YAP/TAZ binding domain, which features an immunoglobulin-like fold essential for interactions with transcriptional cofactors such as YAP, TAZ, and VGLL (Chen2020&lt). These interactions facilitate the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, tissue regeneration, and stem cell maintenance. TEAD4 is particularly significant in trophoblast stem cells, where it promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation (Saha2020TEAD4). The protein's role in the Hippo pathway and its interactions with YAP and TAZ are critical for its function in regulating cell fate and tissue growth, with implications in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (Hsu2022TEAD4).

## Structure
TEAD4, a member of the TEAD family of transcription factors, plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway. Structurally, TEAD4 contains a TEA DNA binding domain and a YAP/TAZ binding domain. The YAP/TAZ binding domain features an immunoglobulin-like fold, which is crucial for interactions with transcriptional cofactors such as YAP, TAZ, and VGLL (p&gt; Chen2020&lt; Structural). The primary structure of TEAD4 includes specific residues like Tyr422, which is essential for forming hydrogen bonds with YAP and TAZ, influencing the protein's interaction activity (Niu2019Molecular).

The secondary structure of TEAD4 comprises 12 beta strands and four alpha helices, forming an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold (Chen2010Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable configuration, with the YAP/TAZ binding domain forming a groove that interacts with YAP through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Chen2010Structural). In terms of quaternary structure, TEAD4 can form complexes with YAP and TAZ, with the interaction being crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation (Chen2010Structural).

TEAD4 undergoes post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, which enhances its stability but is not necessary for its interaction with YAP and TAZ (p&gt; Chen2020&lt; Structural). These structural features and modifications are critical for TEAD4's function in regulating cell proliferation and cancer development.

## Function
TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) is a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, TEAD4 functions as a transcription factor that binds to DNA through its TEA DNA-binding domain and interacts with transcriptional co-activators such as YAP and TAZ via its YAP/TAZ binding domain. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, and stem cell maintenance (p&gt; Chen2020&lt; Structural).

TEAD4 is particularly important in the context of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), where it promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation. It regulates the expression of numerous genes, including those involved in cell cycle progression, such as CDK1 and various cyclins, which are crucial for maintaining the stem state and supporting cell proliferation (Saha2020TEAD4). TEAD4's role in the Hippo pathway involves the regulation of cell fate and tissue growth, with YAP and TAZ acting as critical effectors. When dephosphorylated, YAP and TAZ translocate to the nucleus to interact with TEAD4, driving the transcription of target genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (p&gt; Chen2020&lt; Structural).

## Clinical Significance
TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway. In atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor, TEAD4 is overexpressed, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival, which contributes to the tumor's aggressiveness (Suzuki2016Overexpression). In low-grade glioma (LGG) patients with IDH mutations, high TEAD4 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival, making it an independent prognostic factor (Yuan2021TEAD4). TEAD4 is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where its overexpression correlates with poorer clinical outcomes and promotes cell migration and invasion, contributing to metastasis (Zhang2018TEAD4a).

In breast cancer, TEAD4 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where it enhances cancer stem cell-like properties and chemotherapy resistance (Wu2021HippoTEAD4). TEAD4's role as an oncogene is further supported by its involvement in liver, gastric, and ovarian cancers, where it influences cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and metastasis (Hsu2022TEAD4). These findings highlight TEAD4 as a potential target for therapeutic strategies across various cancer types.

## Interactions
TEAD4 interacts with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) as part of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth and proliferation. The interaction between TEAD4 and YAP1 is mediated by the binding of YAP1's N-terminal region to the C-terminal region of TEAD4. This interaction is characterized by three major contact areas, with the PXXFP motif in YAP1 playing a significant role in complex formation (Chen2010Structural). The TEAD4-YAP1 complex enhances the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, such as CTGF and SGK1, contributing to oncogenic processes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (He2021The).

TEAD4 also forms complexes with TAZ, a paralog of YAP, which can bind to TEAD4 in a manner similar to YAP, but also in a unique mode where two TAZ molecules bridge two TEAD4 molecules (Kaan2017Crystal). These interactions are crucial for the transcriptional regulation of growth-promoting genes and are implicated in cancer development. Disrupting the TEAD4-YAP/TAZ interactions has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting tumor progression (Kaan2017Targeting).
