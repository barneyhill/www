# SPG11

## Overview
The SPG11 gene encodes the protein spatacsin, which is integral to vesicle trafficking and lysosomal function within cells. Spatacsin is a large cytosolic protein that plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in neurons, where it is involved in maintaining lysosome dynamics and distribution. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal WD40 domain and an α-solenoid domain, which facilitate its interaction with the AP5 complex and other proteins involved in membrane remodeling and autophagic lysosome reformation (Mai2024Structural). Mutations in the SPG11 gene are linked to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (AR-HSP), specifically the SPG11 type, which is associated with neurological symptoms such as spasticity, cognitive decline, and a thin corpus callosum (Klebe2015Clinical; Stevanin2007Mutations). The loss of spatacsin function due to these mutations underscores its critical role in neuronal health and axonal maintenance (Murmu2011Cellular).

## Structure
The SPG11 protein, also known as spatacsin, is a large protein (~250 kDa) involved in vesicle trafficking and associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia. Structurally, SPG11 contains an N-terminal WD40 domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the AP5 complex. This domain forms a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, followed by two short α-helices that create a helical hairpin, essential for stabilizing interactions with the AP5 complex (Mai2024Structural).

The protein also features a larger α-solenoid domain, which forms a curved structure by binding in parallel with the α-solenoid domain of SPG15, creating a tight dimer contact. This α-solenoid makes a nearly 90° turn after residue P1906, forming a platform for the FYVE domain, which is linked to the SPG15 core assembly (Mai2024Structural).

SPG11, in conjunction with SPG15, forms an asymmetrical and flexible scaffold that can bind directly to the lipid bilayer via the FYVE domain, facilitating membrane remodeling and autophagic lysosome reformation (Mai2024Structural). Pathogenic mutations in SPG11 often result in truncated proteins, affecting the WD40 domain, helical linker, and extended helical solenoid, highlighting their importance for SPG11 function (Mai2024Structural).

## Function
The SPG11 gene encodes the protein spatacsin, which plays a critical role in lysosome dynamics and intracellular trafficking in healthy human cells. Spatacsin is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that facilitates the formation and motility of tubular lysosomes, essential for lysosome distribution and function (Pierga2023Spatacsin). It promotes the degradation of its partner protein AP5Z1, affecting the recruitment of spastizin to lysosomes, which is crucial for lysosome trafficking and interaction with motor proteins like kinesin KIF13A and the dynein/dynactin complex (Pierga2023Spatacsin).

Spatacsin is involved in maintaining the balance between anterograde and retrograde lysosome movement, particularly in neurons, ensuring proper lysosome distribution along axons (Pierga2023Spatacsin). It also plays a role in autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR), a process necessary for replenishing free lysosomes after increased autophagy, and is involved in endolysosomal transport (Patto2020Distant).

The protein is part of the AP5:SPG11-SPG15 complex, which is crucial for membrane remodeling and cargo sorting from late endosomes to the Golgi apparatus (Mai2024Structural). Spatacsin's functions are vital for maintaining neuronal health, and its loss can lead to neurodegenerative diseases (Murmu2011Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPG11 gene are primarily associated with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (AR-HSP), particularly the SPG11 type, which is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. This condition often presents with a thin corpus callosum (TCC), cognitive decline, and lower motor neuron degeneration (Stevanin2007Mutations). SPG11 mutations account for approximately 20% of AR-HSP cases and are responsible for up to 60% of patients with TCC and cognitive impairment (Klebe2015Clinical).

The clinical manifestations of SPG11 mutations include intellectual disability, cerebellar symptoms, and axonal sensory-motor neuropathy. These mutations often lead to severe motor symptoms, with many patients becoming wheelchair-bound after a mean disease duration of 15 years (Klebe2015Clinical). SPG11 mutations can also result in juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (jALS), where patients exhibit bulbar symptoms typical of ALS but without TCC or cognitive deficits (Klebe2015Clinical).

Radiological findings in SPG11-related conditions often show TCC and periventricular white matter lesions, which can be mistaken for leukodystrophy (Stevanin2007Mutations; Kang2023Clinical). The mutations typically introduce a premature termination codon, leading to the absence of the spatacsin protein, which is crucial for axonal maintenance and transport (PérezBrangulí2014Dysfunction).

## Interactions
The SPG11 gene encodes the spatacsin protein, which is involved in several critical protein interactions. Spatacsin forms a complex with SPG15 and the AP5 adaptor protein complex, playing a significant role in membrane remodeling and lysosomal function. The interaction between spatacsin and the AP5 complex is mediated by the WD40-hairpin domain of spatacsin, which is essential for the stability of the AP5:SPG11-SPG15 complex (Mai2024Structural). This complex is involved in autophagic lysosome reformation and interacts with Rab5A, Rab11, and lysosomal Rag GTPases, influencing its membrane localization and function (Mai2024Structural).

Spatacsin also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate its subcellular localization through phosphorylation at Ser1955. This interaction is crucial for spatacsin's function and is mediated by six out of the seven 14-3-3 isoforms, with a preference for isoforms η and γ (Cogo2020Cytosolic). Additionally, spatacsin interacts with motor proteins such as KIF13A and p150 Glued, which are involved in lysosome trafficking. These interactions are essential for the directionality of lysosome movement and the formation of tubular lysosomes (Pierga2023Spatacsin).
