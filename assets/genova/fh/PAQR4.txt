# PAQR4

## Overview
PAQR4, or Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor Family Member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, which is characterized by its role as a receptor. The PAQR4 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability and signaling pathways. It has been implicated in oncogenic activities, particularly in the context of cancer, where it interacts with key proteins such as Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Nrf2, and AKT, influencing their stability and activity (Zhang2017PAQR4; Wang2023ALKBH5; Xu2020PAQR4). The gene's expression levels are associated with cancer progression and prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Qu2022Overexpressed; Wang2022Pancancer).

## Clinical Significance
PAQR4 is implicated in the progression and poor prognosis of several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PAQR4 is overexpressed and associated with poor overall survival. It is considered an independent prognostic factor, with its high expression linked to pathways such as the cell cycle, Notch signaling, and mTOR signaling (Qu2022Overexpressed). In breast cancer, PAQR4 is significantly upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis, influencing cell proliferation and survival through its role as a ceramidase, which affects sphingolipid metabolism and apoptosis (Zhang2017PAQR4; Pedersen2020GolgiLocalized). 

In prostate cancer, PAQR4 overexpression is linked to tumor growth and metastasis via the PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Ye2020Breviscapine). PAQR4 is also upregulated in bladder cancer and renal clear cell carcinoma, where its knockdown reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022Pancancer). These findings highlight PAQR4's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
PAQR4 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. In breast cancer, PAQR4 negatively regulates the protein level of Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) by affecting its stability and degradation. Knockdown of PAQR4 accelerates CDK4 degradation and increases its polyubiquitination, while overexpression of PAQR4 slows down CDK4 degradation and reduces its polyubiquitination (Zhang2017PAQR4).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PAQR4 interacts with the Nrf2 protein, inhibiting its degradation by blocking the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1. This interaction stabilizes Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins, contributing to chemoresistance in cancer cells (Xu2020PAQR4).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PAQR4 interacts with the AKT protein, promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis via the PI3K/AKT pathway. This interaction is associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wang2023ALKBH5).

These interactions highlight PAQR4's role in modulating key signaling pathways and protein stability, contributing to its oncogenic effects in various cancers.
