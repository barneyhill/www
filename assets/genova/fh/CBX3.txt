# CBX3

## Overview
CBX3, or Chromobox 3, is a gene that encodes the Chromobox protein homolog 3, a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin organization and gene regulation, primarily through its involvement in the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin. The CBX3 protein is characterized by its chromodomain, which binds to methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3), and its chromoshadow domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its function in cellular differentiation and transcriptional regulation (Xiao2011Chromobox; van2021Biological). CBX3 is implicated in various biological processes, including RNA processing and splicing, and is crucial for maintaining lineage specificity during cell differentiation, particularly in neural and mesodermal lineages (Smallwood2012CBX3; Huang2017Cbx3). Additionally, alterations in CBX3 expression have been linked to the progression of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2019Integrated; Chen2018Overexpression).

## Structure
The CBX3 protein, also known as Chromobox protein homolog 3, is a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family. It contains several key structural domains: a chromodomain (CD) and a chromoshadow domain (CSD), which are separated by a less conserved hinge region. The chromodomain, located between amino acids 36 to 79, is responsible for binding to methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3), a modification associated with gene silencing and chromatin organization (Xiao2011Chromobox; van2021Biological). The chromoshadow domain, spanning amino acids 123 to 175, facilitates homo- and heterodimerization and interactions with partner proteins, which are crucial for its function in smooth muscle cell differentiation (Xiao2011Chromobox).

Mutations in the CSD, particularly at amino acids 165 to 168, significantly impair CBX3's ability to mediate smooth muscle cell differentiation, highlighting the importance of these residues in protein-protein interactions (Xiao2011Chromobox). The hinge region, although less conserved, does not appear to be essential for CBX3-induced differentiation (Xiao2011Chromobox). CBX3 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as citrullination, which can affect its chromatin functions during differentiation (van2021Biological).

## Function
CBX3, also known as chromobox 3, is a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family and plays a significant role in chromatin organization and gene regulation in human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to dimethylated and trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) through its chromodomain, contributing to the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin (Smallwood2012CBX3; Huang2017Cbx3).

CBX3 is involved in transcriptional regulation by associating with the bodies of actively transcribed genes, where it influences RNA processing and splicing. It aids in the recruitment of splicing factors such as SNRNP70 and SRSF1, facilitating efficient cotranscriptional RNA processing and reducing the accumulation of unspliced transcripts (Smallwood2012CBX3). This function is crucial for maintaining proper gene expression levels and ensuring the fidelity of RNA splicing.

In the context of cell differentiation, CBX3 plays a role in maintaining lineage specificity, particularly during neural differentiation. It stabilizes the binding of Med26 to the pre-initiation complex, which is essential for the recruitment of Med26 at promoters of target genes, thereby modulating gene expression programs related to neural and mesodermal lineages (Huang2017Cbx3). CBX3's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cell biology and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CBX3 gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers. CBX3 is overexpressed in numerous tumor types, including glioblastoma, gastric cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor survival outcomes and advanced disease stages (Wang2019Integrated; Chen2018Overexpression; p&gt; Lin2020&lt; CBX3). In glioblastoma, high CBX3 expression correlates with shorter patient survival, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Wang2019Integrated). In gastric cancer, CBX3 expression is linked to advanced T stages and high-frequency somatic mutations, including those in the TP53 gene, and is associated with a better response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (p&gt; Lin2020&lt; CBX3).

CBX3 also plays a role in immune-related pathways and tumor immunity. Its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint indicators, impacting the tumor microenvironment and potentially influencing responses to immunotherapy (Niu2022Comprehensive; Xu2022Analysis). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, CBX3 is involved in cell cycle regulation, with its expression positively correlated with genes like CDK1 and PCNA, which are crucial for tumor progression (Chen2018Overexpression). These findings highlight CBX3's significance as a potential target for cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
CBX3, also known as Chromobox protein homolog 3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in gene regulation and cell differentiation. CBX3 contains a chromodomain (CD) that binds to methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me), facilitating its role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation (Canzio2014Mechanisms). The chromoshadow domain (CSD) of CBX3 is essential for dimerization and interaction with other proteins, such as Dia-1, which contains a PxVxL motif. This interaction is critical for smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation, as it modulates the recruitment of the serum response factor (SRF) to SMC-specific gene promoters (Xiao2011Chromobox).

CBX3 also interacts with the Mediator subunit Med26, which is part of the preinitiation complex (PIC) necessary for transcription initiation. This interaction is important for neural differentiation, as it stabilizes Med26 binding to the PIC and modulates gene expression during this process (Huang2017Cbx3). Additionally, CBX3 is involved in transcriptional elongation and RNA processing, primarily localizing to euchromatic regions (Canzio2014Mechanisms). These interactions highlight CBX3's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and cell differentiation.
