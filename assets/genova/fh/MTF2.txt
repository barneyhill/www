# MTF2

## Overview
MTF2, or metal response element binding transcription factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a key player in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. The MTF2 protein is characterized by its involvement in epigenetic regulation, primarily through the facilitation of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression. This protein contains several functional domains, including a Tudor domain, plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc fingers, and an extended homologous (EH) region, which enable it to interact with chromatin and other proteins within the PRC2 complex (Li2011Mammalian; Ngubo2023TissueSpecific). MTF2 is expressed in various isoforms, which may have distinct roles in gene regulation and cellular processes. Its expression and function are critical in developmental processes and have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context (Maganti2018Targeting; Ngubo2023TissueSpecific).

## Structure
MTF2, also known as metal response element binding transcription factor 2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in gene regulation as part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). The molecular structure of MTF2 includes several distinct domains: a Tudor domain, two plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc fingers, an extended homologous (EH) region, and a chromo-like domain located at the C-terminus (Li2011Mammalian; Ngubo2023TissueSpecific). The Tudor domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and recognizes the H3K36me3 histone mark, linking PRC2 to chromatin (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific). The PHD domains are important for interactions with EZH1/2 and may interact with other chromatin modifications (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific).

The EH region of MTF2 folds into a winged-helix structure, which is crucial for binding to unmethylated CpG loci, although this binding mode differs from the canonical winged-helix DNA recognition motif (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific; Perino2018MTF2). MTF2 is expressed in multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, with four in humans and eight in mice, which may have specific protein or DNA-binding targets (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific). The shortest isoform lacks the Tudor domain, which may affect its interaction capabilities (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific).

## Function
MTF2, also known as metal response element binding transcription factor 2, is a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation by recruiting PRC2 to specific genomic sites. MTF2 facilitates the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with gene silencing and chromatin compaction, which is essential for maintaining transcriptional repression during development (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific; Perino2018MTF2).

MTF2 is involved in the recruitment of PRC2 to unmethylated CpG islands, which is crucial for the deposition of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. This activity is important for regulating gene expression, particularly in processes like cell differentiation and development (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific). MTF2 is expressed at high levels in mouse embryonic stem cells and is essential for the proper functioning of PRC2, as its loss results in a marked reduction in PRC2 recruitment (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific).

In the nucleus, MTF2 influences the expression of genes critical for cellular identity and function, playing a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression under stress conditions (Li2011Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
MTF2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MTF2 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor overall survival and higher recurrence rates. It promotes tumor progression by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the transcriptional activation of Snail, leading to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (MTF2; p&gt; Wu2019&lt).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MTF2 deficiency is associated with chemoresistance. The loss of MTF2 leads to reduced levels of PRC2 core proteins and decreased global H3K27me3 levels, contributing to resistance against chemotherapy drugs. MTF2 deficiency also results in the overexpression of MDM2, which degrades p53, further complicating treatment response (Maganti2018Targeting).

MTF2 expression levels also have prognostic value in other cancers. Low MTF2 expression is linked to poor survival in AML, thymoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma, while high expression is associated with reduced survival in HCC and sarcoma, indicating its dual role as a tumor suppressor and oncogene depending on the cancer type (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific).

## Interactions
MTF2 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. MTF2 interacts with core PRC2 components such as EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, facilitating the recruitment of PRC2 to DNA. This interaction is essential for the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a key epigenetic mark associated with gene repression (Perino2018MTF2).

MTF2 specifically binds to unmethylated CpG islands, particularly those containing GCG motifs, which are enriched in Polycomb-targeted regions. This binding is influenced by the helical shape properties of DNA, suggesting a model similar to Drosophila's Polycomb response elements (Perino2018MTF2). MTF2's DNA-binding ability is facilitated by its EH domain, which interacts with linker DNA and CpG islands, showing a preference for loci with underwound helixes (Ngubo2023TissueSpecific).

In addition to its role in PRC2 recruitment, MTF2 is involved in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 axis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MTF2 knockdown leads to increased MDM2 levels and decreased p53 levels, affecting cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. MDM2 inhibitors can restore p53 levels in MTF2-deficient cells, highlighting MTF2's role in modulating this pathway (Maganti2018Targeting).
