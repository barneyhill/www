# SPTBN5

## Overview
The SPTBN5 gene encodes the protein spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 5, also known as βV-spectrin, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in non-erythrocytic cells. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains, spectrin repeats, and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which collectively contribute to its role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating cellular signaling. βV-spectrin is involved in the cross-linking of actin filaments, providing structural integrity and flexibility to cells by forming a network that links membrane proteins and lipids with cytoskeletal elements. Mutations in the SPTBN5 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, although the clinical significance of these mutations can vary, necessitating further research to fully understand their impact (Khan2022SPTBN5; Pitsava2022Exome).

## Structure
The SPTBN5 gene encodes the βV-spectrin protein, which is composed of 3674 amino acids and features several key structural domains. The protein includes two N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains, which are actin-binding domains essential for cross-linking actin filaments into bundles and networks, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling (Khan2022SPTBN5). The majority of the protein, approximately 90%, consists of spectrin repeats. These repeats form a tandem arrangement of helical coiled coils, each creating a three-helix bundle that allows the protein to expand and contract, providing flexibility and facilitating self-association and tetramer formation with alpha spectrins (Khan2022SPTBN5).

At the C-terminal end, the protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids, aiding in the recruitment of proteins to cellular membranes (Khan2022SPTBN5). Specific mutations in the SPTBN5 gene, such as His89Pro and Tyr311*, have been identified, with predicted effects on the protein's structure and function, including destabilization of the helical structure and elimination of spectrin repeats and the PH domain (Khan2022SPTBN5). These structural features and domains are integral to the protein's role in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

## Function
The SPTBN5 gene encodes the βv-spectrin protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the cytoskeletal structure of cells. This protein is composed of several domains, including two N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains, spectrin repeats, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The CH domains are actin-binding domains that facilitate the cross-linking of actin filaments into bundles and networks, which is essential for cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling (Khan2022SPTBN5).

The spectrin repeats, which make up the majority of the protein, form a tandem arrangement of helical coiled coils. These repeats allow the protein to expand and contract, providing flexibility and enabling self-association and tetramer formation with alpha spectrins. This structural arrangement is vital for maintaining cellular integrity and organization by linking membrane proteins, lipids, and cytosolic factors with the cytoskeletal elements of the cell (Khan2022SPTBN5).

The PH domain at the C-terminal end of the protein binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids, aiding in the recruitment of proteins to cellular membranes. This function is important for cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Khan2022SPTBN5). Variants in the SPTBN5 gene can lead to significant structural changes, potentially affecting its role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and cellular signaling (Khan2022SPTBN5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTBN5 gene have been linked to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures, as well as associated symptoms such as aggressive tendencies, craniofacial and physical dysmorphisms, autistic behavior, and gastroesophageal reflux (Khan2022SPTBN5). Specific mutations, such as His89Pro, Tyr311*, Asn2937Tyr, and Glu3262Lys, have been studied for their molecular effects. For instance, the Tyr311* mutation is considered particularly deleterious as it eliminates all spectrin repeats and the C-terminal PH domain, likely rendering the protein non-functional (Khan2022SPTBN5).

In contrast, other studies have suggested that SPTBN5 mutations may not have significant clinical implications. For example, in the context of sacral agenesis, SPTBN5 variants were identified but were not conclusively linked to the condition, with some analyses suggesting these variants might be benign (Porsch2016Sacral; Pitsava2022Exome). The clinical significance of SPTBN5 mutations remains uncertain in some contexts, indicating a need for further research to clarify their role in disease (Pitsava2022Exome).
