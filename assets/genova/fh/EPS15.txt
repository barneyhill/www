# EPS15

## Overview
EPS15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. The protein, also referred to as EPS15, plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by acting as a bridge between membrane cargo and the clathrin coat, facilitating the internalization of receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the transferrin receptor (TfR) (Milesi2019Redundant). Structurally, EPS15 is characterized by the presence of Eps15 Homology (EH) domains, a coiled-coil region, and ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and its function in cellular processes (Roxrud2008An; van2009Eps15:). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation and mono-ubiquitination, which are crucial for its role in endocytosis and signal transduction (van2009Eps15:). EPS15 is also implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling and the degradation of growth factor receptors, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Roxrud2008An; Milesi2019Redundant).

## Structure
The EPS15 protein is characterized by a modular structure comprising several distinct domains. The primary structure includes three Eps15 Homology (EH) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and consist of EF-hand calcium-binding motifs (van2009Eps15:; Fazioli1993eps15). The secondary structure features a coiled-coil region, which facilitates oligomerization and is common in cytoskeleton-related proteins (Fazioli1993eps15). The protein also contains DPF motifs that interact with the appendage of α-adaptin, a component of the AP-2 complex, and a tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 850, which is phosphorylated upon EGF and HGF stimulation (van2009Eps15:).

Post-translational modifications of EPS15 include tyrosine phosphorylation and mono-ubiquitination, which are crucial for its function in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking (van2009Eps15:; Milesi2019Redundant). The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as Eps15b, which lacks domain I but has a unique N-terminal stretch (van2009Eps15:). These structural features and modifications enable EPS15 to participate in various cellular processes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis and signal transduction.

## Function
EPS15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15) is a protein involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, playing a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). It acts as an endocytic adaptor, bridging membrane cargo with the clathrin coat, and is essential for the internalization of receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the transferrin receptor (TfR) (Milesi2019Redundant). EPS15 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following EGFR activation, indicating its role in signal transduction within the EGFR signaling pathway (Fazioli1993eps15).

EPS15 is localized to the cytosol and the rims of clathrin-coated pits, where it interacts with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex. It contains several functional domains, including Eps15 homology (EH) domains for protein-protein interactions, a coiled-coil domain for oligomerization, and ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) necessary for binding ubiquitin (Roxrud2008An). In addition to its role in endocytosis, EPS15 is involved in synaptic vesicle recycling, as demonstrated in model organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster (Milesi2019Redundant).

In humans, EPS15 is also implicated in the degradation of growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, by interacting with the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) on endosomes, facilitating the sorting and degradation of ubiquitinated receptors (Roxrud2008An). This function is crucial for attenuating growth factor signaling and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EPS15 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. High levels of EPS15 expression are associated with a favorable prognosis in breast cancer, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Azarnia2019Endocytic). In contrast, EPS15 was initially identified as an oncogene capable of transforming NIH3T3 cells upon overexpression, indicating its complex role in cancer biology (Azarnia2019Endocytic).

EPS15 is also involved in synaptic vesicle recycling, and its dysfunction can lead to impaired neurotransmission, as observed in model organisms like C. elegans and D. melanogaster (Azarnia2019Endocytic). In mammals, EPS15 and its paralog Eps15R have redundant roles in endocytosis, particularly in the hematopoietic system, where their deletion leads to anemia due to defective endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (Azarnia2019Endocytic).

Alterations in EPS15 interactions, such as with ITSN1 and synaptojanin1, affect synaptic plasticity and are crucial for the regulation of the synaptic AP2 clathrin-coated vesicle life cycle (Mishra2021Synaptic). These interactions are important for maintaining normal synaptic function, and disruptions can contribute to neurological defects (Mishra2021Synaptic).

## Interactions
EPS15 is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for intracellular trafficking and endocytosis. It interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2, playing a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This interaction involves the carboxyl termini of Eps15 and the α-subunit of AP-2, and Eps15 is constitutively associated with clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane (Chi2008Eps15; Salcini1997Binding).

Eps15 also interacts with the AP-1 complex at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where a specific 14-amino acid motif within its DPF repeats domain is crucial for binding to AP-1 but not AP-2. This interaction is essential for vesicle trafficking from the TGN (Chi2008Eps15).

The protein contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that bind to polyubiquitinated proteins and ubiquitin E3-ligases such as Nedd4 and Parkin, suggesting a role in ubiquitin-mediated processes and potentially autophagy (van2009Eps15:). Eps15 also interacts with proteins like Epsin1, Numb, and intersectin, which are involved in endocytosis and receptor internalization (Salcini1997Binding; van2009Eps15:). These interactions highlight Eps15's role in forming and regulating protein complexes essential for cellular trafficking pathways.
