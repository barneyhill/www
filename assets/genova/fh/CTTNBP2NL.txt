# CTTNBP2NL

## Overview
CTTNBP2NL is a gene that encodes the CTTNBP2 N-terminal like protein, which is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization, particularly through its interactions with actin filaments. The protein is categorized as a cortactin-binding protein and plays a significant role in modulating actin dynamics, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport (Shi2016STRIPAK; Hsueh2012Neuronspecific). CTTNBP2NL is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, lung, and spleen, and is associated with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways and phosphatase activity regulation (Chen2012CortactinBinding; Sugimoto2013Genetic). The protein's interaction with the STRIPAK complex and its distinct subcellular distribution compared to its homolog, CTTNBP2, indicate its involvement in targeting specific cellular structures, although its precise functions in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity remain to be fully elucidated (Hwang2014STRIPAK).

## Function
CTTNBP2NL (CTTNBP2 N-terminal like) is a protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, particularly in actin filament dynamics, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport. In healthy human cells, CTTNBP2NL interacts with cortactin, a protein that binds to F-actin, through its proline-rich region and the SH3 domain of cortactin (Shi2016STRIPAK). This interaction suggests a role in modulating actin dynamics, potentially influencing cellular processes such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal development (Hsueh2012Neuronspecific).

CTTNBP2NL is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, lung, and spleen, and is associated with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex in HEK293 cells (Shi2016STRIPAK; Chen2012CortactinBinding). This association indicates a potential role in regulating phosphatase activity, which could affect cellular processes through dephosphorylation mechanisms (Sugimoto2013Genetic). Although the specific molecular processes and organismal outcomes of CTTNBP2NL's function in humans are not fully understood, its interaction with PP2A and cortactin suggests it may play a role in cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics (Shi2016STRIPAK; Sugimoto2013Genetic).

## Interactions
CTTNBP2NL, a cortactin-binding protein, is involved in targeting STRIPAK complexes to specific subcellular locations. It binds to the STRIPAK core complex and has a distinct subcellular distribution compared to its related protein, CTTNBP2. CTTNBP2NL colocalizes with cortactin at stress fibers more than CTTNBP2 does, indicating a role in targeting cortactin to different populations of actin fibers. In neurons, CTTNBP2NL does not stably localize to dendritic spines, unlike CTTNBP2, which is crucial for targeting striatin and zinedin to these structures. This suggests that CTTNBP2NL may not target STRIPAK to dendritic spines, as overexpression of CTTNBP2NL does not rescue the spine density phenotype in CTTNBP2 knockdown neurons. This indicates that CTTNBP2NL and CTTNBP2 may direct STRIPAK complexes to different subcellular compartments, although further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis (Hwang2014STRIPAK).
