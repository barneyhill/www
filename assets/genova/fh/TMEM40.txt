# TMEM40

## Overview
TMEM40 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 40, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. TMEM40 has been studied for its role in different types of cancers, where its expression levels are often altered. In particular, high expression of TMEM40 has been linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in cancers such as tongue squamous cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The protein's function in these malignancies is thought to be mediated through pathways involving key regulatory proteins such as p53, Bax, and MMP-9, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2021Decreased; Zhang2018High; Zhang2018Higha).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM40 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), high expression of TMEM40 is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis. Overexpression of TMEM40 in TSCC cells leads to a decrease in the G0/G1 phase cell population and an increase in S-phase cells, indicating enhanced cell cycle progression. Conversely, silencing TMEM40 results in increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. These changes are linked to increased expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and activation of apoptosis-associated proteins like Bax, while reducing levels of invasion-associated proteins such as MMP-9 (Zhang2018Higha).

In bladder cancer, TMEM40 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Silencing TMEM40 in bladder cancer cell lines suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promotes apoptosis. This is accompanied by an accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins and a decrease in c-MYC and cyclin D1 proteins, suggesting that TMEM40 may act as an oncogene through the p53 signaling pathway (Zhang2018High).

In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), TMEM40 expression is increased in tumor tissues and is associated with larger tumor sizes. Silencing TMEM40 in CSCC cell lines leads to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis, reducing migration and invasion capabilities (Yu2021Decreased).
