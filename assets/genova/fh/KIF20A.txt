# KIF20A

## Overview
KIF20A is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 20A, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-6 family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell division, particularly during the processes of anaphase and cytokinesis, by facilitating microtubule dynamics and spindle organization. KIF20A is characterized by its unique structural domains, including a motor domain responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, which enables it to move along microtubules and perform its cellular functions (Wu2019Roles; Ranaivoson2022Nucleotidefree). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as microtubule bundling and the recruitment of proteins to the Golgi complex and mitotic spindle, and is regulated by phosphorylation (Wu2019Roles). KIF20A's interactions with other proteins, such as Rab6 and components of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, underscore its significance in cellular transport and its potential role in cancer progression (Xiong2019KIF20A). Alterations in the KIF20A gene have been linked to several diseases, including various cancers and congenital heart conditions, highlighting its clinical importance (He2022KIF20A; Louw2018Compound).

## Structure
The KIF20A protein, encoded by the KIF20A gene, is a member of the kinesin-6 family and plays a critical role in spindle organization during cell division. It consists of 890 amino acids and is structured into three functional domains: a globular N-terminal motor domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tail domain (Wu2019Roles). The motor domain is responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, featuring unique structural elements such as a 60-amino acid N-terminus extension and a 99-amino acid loop 6, which forms a distinct subdomain (Wu2019Roles; Ranaivoson2022Nucleotidefree).

The secondary structure of KIF20A includes a highly twisted central β-sheet and an outward-positioned α0 helix, contributing to its stable open conformation, which is independent of microtubule binding (Ranaivoson2022Nucleotidefree). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by its atypical allostery, with the L6 loop playing a significant role in stabilizing the open state of the nucleotide binding site (Ranaivoson2022Nucleotidefree).

KIF20A can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, with the central coiled-coil domain essential for dimerization and interactions with partner proteins (Wu2019Roles). The protein's structure allows it to bridge two microtubule protofilaments, facilitating its role in intracellular transport and microtubule organization (Wu2019Roles).

## Function
KIF20A, a member of the kinesin-6 family, plays a critical role in cell division, particularly during anaphase and cytokinesis. It is involved in microtubule bundling, essential for central spindle assembly and cleavage furrow formation. KIF20A's motor domain, powered by ATP hydrolysis, facilitates movement towards the plus ends of microtubules, contributing to its specialized role in microtubule dynamics (Wu2019Roles). The protein is crucial for proper spindle organization and chromosome segregation during cell division, interacting with proteins such as Rab6, Mad2, and Aurora B to regulate its localization and function (Wu2019Roles).

KIF20A is expressed in various tissues, with its expression peaking during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. It is involved in recruiting and stabilizing proteins at the Golgi complex and the mitotic spindle, and plays a role in the polarized accumulation of RhoA, necessary for furrow formation during cell division (Wu2019Roles). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, affecting its role in cytokinetic abscission (Wu2019Roles). KIF20A is also involved in the relocation of the chromosomal passenger complex during mitosis, which is vital for cytokinesis (Wu2019Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIF20A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and congenital heart conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KIF20A is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. Its knockdown enhances the sensitivity of LUAD cells to gemcitabine and ferroptosis inducers, suggesting its role in chemoresistance and tumor proliferation (He2022KIF20A). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high KIF20A expression correlates with poorer patient survival and is linked to tumor grade, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Yang2021Identification).

KIF20A mutations are also associated with a novel lethal congenital cardiomyopathy. Compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in KIF20A lead to severe cardiac abnormalities, including restrictive cardiomyopathy and pulmonary stenosis, as observed in two siblings. These mutations result in impaired microtubule motility and disrupted cellular processes, contributing to the cardiomyopathy phenotype (Louw2018Compound).

In renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), KIF20A expression is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It interacts with the transcription factor IRF6, which can inhibit KIF20A, affecting cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Ma2021Inhibition).

## Interactions
KIF20A, also known as Rabkinesin-6 or mitotic kinesin-like protein 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with GTP-bound Rab6 in the Golgi apparatus, a key interaction that facilitates its association with the Golgi. The hydrolysis of GTP by Rab6 results in the dissociation of KIF20A from the Golgi, indicating that its interaction with Rab6 is regulated by the GTP/GDP state of Rab6 (Bai page 8 of 21). This interaction exemplifies how motor proteins are regulated by small GTPases, which are significant in vesicular trafficking and organelle positioning.

In the context of cancer, KIF20A is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes genes such as KIF2C, KIF23, CDC25, CCNB1, and DLGAP5, whose expression is positively correlated with KIF20A expression. These interactions suggest that KIF20A is involved in a larger network contributing to tumorigenesis (Liu2022A). KIF20A also interacts with components of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is implicated in enhancing malignant characteristics in colorectal cancer (Xiong2019KIF20A). These interactions highlight KIF20A's role in modulating cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression.
