# CALML5

## Overview
The CALML5 gene encodes the calmodulin-like protein 5, a calcium-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in epidermal differentiation and skin barrier function. This protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protein due to its structural similarity to calmodulin, a well-known calcium sensor. CALML5 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and other stratified epithelial tissues, where it regulates the expression of genes essential for keratinocyte differentiation. The protein interacts with stratifin (SFN), a 14-3-3 protein, to modulate the localization and activity of transcriptional regulators such as YAP1, thereby influencing epidermal cell growth and differentiation (Sun2015CALML5). CALML5's function is critically dependent on its calcium-binding motifs, underscoring the importance of calcium in its regulatory activities (Sun2015CALML5). Additionally, alterations in CALML5 expression have been linked to skin disorders and breast cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Debald2013Specific; Sun2015CALML5).

## Function
The CALML5 gene encodes calmodulin-like protein 5, a calcium-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. CALML5 is highly expressed in the differentiated layers of the epidermis and is up-regulated by the transcription factor ZNF750, with its mRNA stability enhanced by the long noncoding RNA TINCR (Sun2015CALML5). The protein interacts with stratifin (SFN), a 14-3-3 protein subtype, to regulate a subset of late differentiation genes, which is essential for maintaining the epidermal barrier function (Sun2015CALML5).

CALML5 is involved in the regulation of late epidermal differentiation, affecting the expression of genes necessary for this process. It influences the localization of the transcriptional regulator YAP1, which is sequestered in the cytoplasm by SFN during keratinocyte differentiation (Sun2015CALML5). The protein's function is dependent on its calcium-binding motifs, as only wild-type CALML5 can rescue transcriptional activity, indicating the importance of calcium in its regulatory role (Sun2015CALML5). CALML5 is specifically expressed in the epidermis and other stratified epithelial tissues, contributing to the establishment of skin barrier function (Sun2015CALML5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CALML5 gene have been implicated in various skin-related conditions and breast cancer. In the context of breast cancer, particularly in premenopausal patients, CALML5 undergoes K63-linked ubiquitination, which is not associated with protein degradation but rather with processes like protein trafficking and DNA repair. This modification is observed in a significant proportion of premenopausal breast cancer patients, suggesting a role in the disease's progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Debald2013Specific).

In skin biology, CALML5 is crucial for epidermal differentiation. Its depletion leads to impaired expression of late differentiation genes, affecting proteins essential for skin barrier function, such as filaggrin and loricrin. This results in compromised lipid barrier formation and increased transepidermal water loss, indicating a role in conditions like atopic dermatitis (Sun2015CALML5). CALML5 interacts with stratifin (SFN) to regulate epidermal differentiation, and its expression is modulated by the transcription factor ZNF750 and stabilized by the long noncoding RNA TINCR. Disruption in these interactions can lead to skin barrier dysfunction and related diseases (Sun2015CALML5).

## Interactions
CALML5, a calmodulin-like protein, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for epidermal differentiation. It interacts with stratifin (SFN), a 14-3-3 protein subtype, which plays a role in protein kinase C signaling and the regulation of epidermal cell growth. This interaction is significant for the expression of a large subset of CALML5 target genes and occurs in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes (Sun2015CALML5). CALML5 also affects the localization of the transcriptional regulator YAP1, which is sequestered by SFN to the cytoplasm during keratinocyte differentiation. CALML5 depletion impairs the translocation of YAP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, indicating its role in the SFN-YAP1 signaling pathway (Sun2015CALML5).

CALML5 modulates the binding of SFN to its interactors, such as PKP3 and EXPH5, with altered interactions observed in CALML5-depleted cells (Sun2015CALML5). The protein is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, while SFN is found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellular space, suggesting that CALML5 may influence gene transcription by interacting with proteins like SFN that can translocate to the nucleus (Sun2015CALML5).
