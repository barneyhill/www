# CDKN1C

## Overview
The CDKN1C gene encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (p57Kip2), a crucial protein in the regulation of the cell cycle. As a member of the CIP/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p57Kip2 plays a significant role in controlling cell proliferation by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes, particularly during the G1-to-S phase transition. This protein is characterized by distinct domains, including a Kinase Inhibitor Domain (KID) that is essential for its inhibitory function. Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, p57Kip2 is involved in various cellular processes such as differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy, and is critical for the development of several tissues. Mutations in the CDKN1C gene are associated with genetic disorders like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and IMAGe syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in growth regulation and disease (Stampone2018Genetic; Matsuoka1995p57KIP2).

## Structure
The CDKN1C gene encodes the p57Kip2 protein, a member of the CIP/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The protein is composed of 316 amino acids and is characterized by several distinct domains. The N-terminal region contains a Kinase Inhibitor Domain (KID), which is essential for binding to cyclin-CDK complexes and inhibiting kinase activity (Stampone2021A). This domain includes a cyclin-binding domain, a CDK-binding site, and a 3_10 helix that mimics ATP to block CDKs (Stampone2018Genetic).

The central region of p57Kip2 features proline/alanine-rich repeats, known as the PAPA region, which are unique to this protein and absent in other CIP/Kip family members (Stampone2021A). The C-terminal region contains a QT domain, which is homologous to p27Kip1 and includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) necessary for nuclear import (Stampone2021A). The sequence RKRLR (residues 312-316) within this region is crucial for nuclear localization (Stampone2021A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at threonine 310, play a significant role in regulating the protein's degradation and function (Stampone2018Genetic). CDKN1C also has several splice variant isoforms, resulting from the use of different splice acceptor sites, which lead to variations in the amino-terminal region of the protein (Lee1995Cloning).

## Function
The CDKN1C gene encodes the p57KIP2 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes, particularly those involved in the G1-to-S phase transition. This inhibition is essential for controlling cell proliferation and ensuring proper cell division (Borges2015Mutations; Matsuoka1995p57KIP2). The p57KIP2 protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdk2 and cdk4, and cyclins E, A, and D1, effectively inhibiting their kinase activity and arresting cells in the G1 phase (Lee1995Cloning).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, p57KIP2 is involved in maintaining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence by modulating the subcellular localization of cell cycle regulatory complexes, contributing to tissue homeostasis (Zou2011p57Kip2). The protein also plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, movement, apoptosis, and autophagy, and is involved in the development of several tissues, such as the cerebral cortex, where it promotes cell survival and prevents apoptosis (Laukoter2020Imprinted; Stampone2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDKN1C gene are associated with several genetic and epigenetic disorders, primarily involving imprinting alterations on chromosome 11p15.5. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a notable condition linked to CDKN1C, characterized by overgrowth, tumor predisposition, and various congenital malformations. BWS is often caused by loss-of-function mutations in CDKN1C, which are frequently observed in familial cases and can lead to increased proliferation and cancer risk (ndash; Stampone2018Genetic; Berland2020Deep; Wiedemann; Miozzo2014Beckwith&amp).

In contrast, IMAGe syndrome, which involves growth inhibition, is associated with gain-of-function mutations in the PCNA binding domain of CDKN1C. These mutations increase protein stability, preventing cell cycle progression and causing growth restriction (Berland2020Deep; Stampone2018Genetic; Suntharalingham2020Analysis). Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS), characterized by growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities, also involves imprinting alterations in the 11p15 region, with some cases reporting CDKN1C mutations (Stampone2018Genetic; Sabir2019Familial).

The expression of CDKN1C is regulated by long non-coding RNAs, which can epigenetically inactivate the gene, impacting cell growth and differentiation (Stampone2018Genetic). These complex regulatory networks underscore the gene's significant role in various growth-related conditions.

## Interactions
The CDKN1C gene encodes the p57Kip2 protein, which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The p57Kip2 protein interacts with cyclin/CDK complexes, such as cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin D1,2/CDK4, inhibiting their kinase activity and thus regulating the cell cycle (Stampone2018Genetic; Stampone2021A). The amino-terminal domain of p57Kip2 contains a Kinase Inhibitor Domain (KID) essential for these interactions (Stampone2021A).

p57Kip2 also interacts with transcription factors like MyoD, Mash1, NeuroD, and Nex/Math2, as well as B-Myb, which competes with cyclin A2 for binding to p57Kip2 (Stampone2018Genetic). The central region of p57Kip2, unique to this protein, interacts with LIMK1, a kinase involved in actin polymerization (Stampone2021A).

The carboxy-terminal region of p57Kip2 includes a QT box domain that binds to c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, inhibiting it, and a binding domain for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), although p57Kip2 binds PCNA with lower affinity than p21Cip1/WAF1 (Stampone2018Genetic; Stampone2021A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of p57Kip2 in cell cycle regulation and its potential implications in various diseases.
