# NBPF26

## Overview
Neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 26 (NBPF26) is a gene that encodes the NBPF member 26 protein, which is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family. This family is characterized by its involvement in genomic rearrangements and structural variants, which are significant in the context of genomic instability and brain expansion (Logsdon2024Complex). The NBPF26 protein is implicated in various biological processes, although its precise molecular functions remain to be fully elucidated. The gene's expression and potential mutations have been associated with several clinical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Acoba2024Kidney; Yao2022Wholeexome). Additionally, NBPF26's proximity to NOTCH2NL genes suggests a role in neurodevelopmental processes, possibly contributing to disorders related to brain development (Fiddes2019Paired).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
NBPF26 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression and potential mutations. In the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), NBPF26 is notably upregulated in patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a role in CKD pathogenesis (Acoba2024Kidney). This upregulation has been consistently observed across multiple studies, indicating its potential involvement in the disease mechanism.

In the realm of cancer, NBPF26 has been identified as a potential driver mutation gene in hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the lung (HAL). This identification was made using OncodriveCLUST software, which highlights the gene's possible role in the development of HAL and its relevance in exploring targeted therapies (Yao2022Wholeexome).

NBPF26 is also associated with genomic instability and brain expansion, as it is involved in complex structural variants (CSVs) that can lead to genomic rearrangements. These structural changes, including the deletion of NBPF26, may have clinical significance, although specific diseases directly linked to these alterations are not detailed (Logsdon2024Complex). The gene's proximity to NOTCH2NL genes suggests shared transcriptional regulation, which may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (Fiddes2019Paired).
