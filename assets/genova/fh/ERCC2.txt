# ERCC2

## Overview
ERCC2, also known as XPD, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a helicase subunit within the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) core complex. This protein, categorized as a DNA helicase, plays a pivotal role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription initiation. The ERCC2 protein is essential for unwinding DNA around sites of damage, facilitating the repair of UV-induced lesions and other DNA distortions, thereby maintaining genomic stability. It is also involved in anchoring the Cyclin H-Cdk7-MAT1 complex to the TFIIH core, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of various cell cycle regulatory proteins. Mutations in the ERCC2 gene can lead to disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne syndrome, underscoring its critical role in DNA repair and transcription processes (Mezzina1994Correction; Thompson1998Nucleotide).

## Structure
ERCC2, also known as XPD, is a helicase subunit of the TFIIH complex, playing a crucial role in nucleotide excision repair and transcription. The protein structure of ERCC2 includes several important domains. It contains RecA1 and RecA2 helicase domains, which are essential for its helicase activity, with Walker A and B motifs located at their interface (Tsutakawa2021Decoding). The protein also features an iron-sulfur (FeS) domain and an arch domain, which are predicted to open for single-stranded DNA binding. The FeS cluster is thought to facilitate communication with other FeS-containing proteins through charge transfer along DNA (Tsutakawa2021Decoding).

The RecA-like ATP binding domains are followed by an RQC domain, which includes a Zn-binding subdomain and a WH DNA binding subdomain responsible for strand separation. The HRDC domain is necessary for binding and unwinding double Holliday junctions (Tsutakawa2021Decoding). The N-and C-terminal flexible regions of ERCC2 interact with protein partners such as RPA, Topoisomerases, RMI1, and RAD51 (Tsutakawa2021Decoding). These structural features are critical for the protein's function in DNA repair and its interaction within the TFIIH complex.

## Function
The ERCC2 gene, also known as XPD, encodes a protein that is a critical component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription initiation in healthy human cells. The ERCC2 protein functions as an ATP-dependent DNA helicase, unwinding DNA in the 5'-3' direction around sites of damage, facilitating the repair of UV-induced lesions and other DNA distortions (Thompson1998Nucleotide; Takayama1997DNA; Dabholkar1992ERCC1).

In the NER pathway, ERCC2's helicase activity is crucial for opening the DNA double helix, allowing other repair proteins to access and excise damaged DNA segments. This process is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Clarkson2005Polymorphisms; Lu2013ERCC1). ERCC2 is also involved in transcription initiation by anchoring the Cyclin H-Cdk7-MAT1 complex to the TFIIH core, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of various cell cycle regulatory proteins, including p53 (Paul2014Arsenicinduced).

Mutations in ERCC2 can lead to disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne syndrome, highlighting its role in DNA repair and transcription (Mezzina1994Correction; Thompson1998Nucleotide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions due to its role in DNA repair. Somatic mutations in ERCC2 are linked to increased sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. These mutations lead to a loss of normal nucleotide excision repair (NER) function, making tumor cells more susceptible to DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin (Van2014Somatic). In urothelial tumors, ERCC2 mutations are associated with a distinct genomic signature, known as signature 5*, which is linked to increased mutation burden and potentially influenced by tobacco exposure (Kim2016Somatic).

In the context of hereditary cancer, ERCC2 polymorphisms, such as Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln, have been studied for their association with breast and ovarian cancer risk. These polymorphisms, when combined with certain lifestyle factors, can increase cancer susceptibility (BernardGallon2008DNA). Additionally, the SNP rs13181 in ERCC2 has been associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and breast cancer in specific populations (Mitra2009Statistically).

ERCC2 mutations are also implicated in genetic disorders like xeroderma pigmentosum and trichothiodystrophy, which are characterized by defects in DNA repair and increased sensitivity to UV radiation (Rump2016Identification).

## Interactions
ERCC2, also known as XPD, is a helicase subunit of the TFIIH complex involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in these processes. Within the TFIIH complex, ERCC2 interacts with the p44 subunit, which is essential for its helicase activity. Mutations in the C-terminal end of ERCC2 can weaken this interaction, leading to decreased helicase activity (Compe2016Nucleotide). ERCC2 also interacts with the CAK complex, which includes CDK7, Cyclin H, and MAT1, forming a distinct complex that exhibits CAK activity (Reardon1996Isolation).

ERCC2's interaction with DNA is facilitated by its ATPase lobes and FeS domain, which are involved in DNA lesion sensing. The ATPase lobe 2 of ERCC2 interacts with DNA bases near the duplex-single-strand junction, a unique feature among SF2 family helicases (Kokic2019Structural). ERCC2 also interacts with the XPA protein, which stabilizes the TFIIH complex and facilitates DNA retention near the XPB active site (Kokic2019Structural).

ERCC2 is involved in the regulation of the kinase module of TFIIH, where its helicase activity can be repressed. This repression is counteracted by XPA and XPG, which stabilize TFIIH in a conformation incompatible with kinase module binding (Kokic2019Structural).
