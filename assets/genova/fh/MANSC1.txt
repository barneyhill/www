# MANSC1

## Overview
The MANSC1 gene encodes the protein MANSC domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a MANSC domain, a motif implicated in various cellular processes. This protein is involved in protein-protein interactions and has been associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of cancer, MANSC1 is notably overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has been linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Vastrad2019Investigation). Additionally, genetic variants of MANSC1 have been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (Haiman2013GenomeWide). The protein also interacts with RNA, as evidenced by its binding with the m6A binding protein YTHDC1, indicating a role in gene expression regulation (Liu2019Genomewide). Furthermore, MANSC1 has been implicated in immune response pathways, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease and periodontitis, highlighting its potential involvement in inflammatory processes (Hu2022Identifying).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MANSC1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MANSC1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This elevated expression is associated with worse overall survival rates, suggesting that MANSC1 could serve as a potential biomarker for NSCLC prognosis (Vastrad2019Investigation). In prostate cancer, genetic variants in MANSC1 have been associated with a reduced risk, indicating a possible protective effect against the disease (Haiman2013GenomeWide).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), MANSC1 has been identified as an elevated plasma protein in patients, although its specific role in CRC risk and progression requires further investigation (UrbiolaSalvador2023Plasma). The gene has also been detected in various hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, but no significant correlations with survival have been observed in these contexts (UrbiolaSalvador2023Plasma).

Additionally, MANSC1 has been identified as one of the hub genes potentially linking periodontitis and Parkinson's disease, although its specific clinical significance in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated (Hu2022Identifying).

## Interactions
MANSC1 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, indicating its potential role in various cellular processes. In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MANSC1 is identified as a highly connected gene within the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, suggesting its involvement in regulating information flow and response times within the cellular network (Vastrad2019Investigation). The gene is also regulated by 11 transcription factors, which may influence its expression and function in cancer progression (Vastrad2019Investigation).

In Parkinson's disease, MANSC1 is highly correlated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells, indicating a potential interaction with immune cells (Hu2022Identifying). The study also highlights significant negative correlations between MANSC1 and other hub cross-talk genes in periodontitis, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory response pathways (Hu2022Identifying).

Additionally, MANSC1 has been identified as a binding site for the m6A binding protein YTHDC1, indicating a potential interaction with RNA in mammalian cells (Liu2019Genomewide). This interaction suggests that MANSC1 may play a role in RNA binding and gene expression regulation.
