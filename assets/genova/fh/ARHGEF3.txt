# ARHGEF3

## Overview
ARHGEF3 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3, which is a critical component in the regulation of Rho GTPases, particularly RhoA and RhoB. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating Rho GTPases that are essential for various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, and motility (Khaliq2022Role; D’Amato2015ARHGEF3). ARHGEF3 is also involved in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), influencing pathways related to cell growth and differentiation (Khaliq2022Role). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, including skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in muscle regeneration and maintenance, particularly during aging (You2020ARHGEF3). Additionally, ARHGEF3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, such as cancer and muscle-related disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (You2020ARHGEF3; Zhou2022ARHGEF3).

## Function
The ARHGEF3 gene encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays a crucial role in activating Rho GTPases, specifically RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC, RhoG, Rac1, or Cdc42 (Khaliq2022Role; D’Amato2015ARHGEF3). These GTPases are pivotal in regulating actin dynamics, which are essential for cellular processes such as cell polarity, adhesion, motility, growth, and differentiation (Khaliq2022Role). ARHGEF3 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, thereby activating them and promoting the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho kinase-dependent manner (Khaliq2022Role).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal organization, ARHGEF3 interacts with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), inhibiting its kinase activity, particularly affecting Akt, through its N-terminal region and pleckstrin homology domain (Khaliq2022Role). This interaction is crucial for controlling mTORC2 activity, which is involved in various signaling pathways. ARHGEF3 is expressed in several tissues, including skeletal muscle, where it regulates muscle regeneration and strength through autophagy (You2020ARHGEF3). The gene's activity is significant in maintaining muscle quality, particularly during aging, by preserving autophagy flux (You2020ARHGEF3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ARHGEF3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in various cancers and conditions affecting muscle and bone health. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ARHGEF3 is significantly upregulated in response to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) like MS275, playing a crucial role in the differentiation of leukemia cells through the RhoA-dependent pathway. This suggests that targeting ARHGEF3 could enhance differentiation as a therapeutic strategy in AML (D’Amato2015ARHGEF3).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ARHGEF3 is overexpressed and promotes cancer cell proliferation by stabilizing ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. This stabilization occurs through interactions with SIRT2, affecting ACLY's acetylation and ubiquitination, which are crucial for tumor growth. The knockdown of ARHGEF3 in NSCLC cells leads to reduced proliferation and tumorigenicity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2022ARHGEF3).

In skeletal muscle, ARHGEF3 regulates muscle regeneration and strength through autophagy. Depletion of ARHGEF3 in mice enhances muscle regeneration and strength, particularly in aged mice, by activating autophagy and improving muscle quality, suggesting its potential role in treating muscle-related conditions (You2020ARHGEF3).

## Interactions
ARHGEF3, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ARHGEF3 interacts with ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) in the cytoplasm, enhancing its stability by promoting deacetylation through the recruitment of SIRT2, a deacetylase. This interaction is specific to acetylated forms of ACLY at lysine residues K17 and K86, and ARHGEF3's role is crucial for the deacetylation and stabilization of ACLY, impacting lung cancer cell proliferation (Zhou2022ARHGEF3).

ARHGEF3 also interacts with phosphoinositides, specifically binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is necessary for its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards RhoA. This interaction is essential for ARHGEF3's localization to the plasma membrane and its role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Singh2020Redefining).

In acute myeloid leukemia, ARHGEF3 is involved in the activation of the RhoA pathway, which includes interactions with downstream effectors like ROCK, modulating pathways such as JNK phosphorylation and activation, which are important for cell differentiation (D’Amato2015ARHGEF3).
