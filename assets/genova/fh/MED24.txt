# MED24

## Overview
MED24 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 24, a crucial component of the Mediator complex involved in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge facilitating interactions between RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors, thereby playing a pivotal role in gene expression. MED24 is part of the Tail module of the Mediator complex, where it contributes to the structural integrity and functional dynamics of the complex. The protein is particularly significant in the regulation of cell cycle progression and mammary gland development, acting as a coactivator for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (Hasegawa2012Mediator). MED24's interactions within the Mediator complex are essential for its role in transcriptional regulation, impacting both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions such as cancer (Zhao2021Structure; Liu2019ERBB2).

## Structure
The MED24 protein is a component of the mammalian Mediator complex, specifically part of the Tail module. The structure of MED24, along with other Tail subunits, was elucidated using a 4.0 Å resolution cryo-EM map, which revealed its organization and interactions within the complex (Zhao2021Structure). MED24 forms the distal end of the lower Tail, alongside MED23, and is positioned near the MED16 β-propeller. MED23 and MED24 share a roughly homologous structure and organization (Zhao2021Structure).

The N-terminal domain of MED24 interacts with the N-terminal domain of MED1, specifically through a hydrophobic patch, which is crucial for the stability and conformation of the Mediator complex (Zhao2021Structure). This interaction contributes to the rigidity of the Tail module, influencing the overall conformation of the core Mediator and its interaction with RNA polymerase II (Zhao2021Structure).

The structure of MED24 is characterized by interactions involving charged, hydrophobic, and cationic-π interactions, which are essential for its integration into the Mediator complex (Zhao2021Structure). The detailed molecular structure of MED24, including specific domains or post-translational modifications, is not explicitly described in the available context.

## Function
MED24 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is essential for transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in facilitating the interaction between RNA polymerase II and transcription factors, thereby influencing gene expression. In healthy human cells, MED24 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and is crucial for normal mammary gland development. It acts as a magnifier of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-mediated coactivation function, enhancing the transcriptional activity of ERα, which is important for mammary gland development during puberty (Hasegawa2012Mediator).

MED24, along with MED1, is necessary for the expression of genes such as E2F1 and cyclin D1, which are critical for the G1/S-phase transition of the cell cycle (Hasegawa2012Mediator). The MED24-containing submodule is involved in amplifying the effects of activators on the transcriptional machinery, which is crucial for recruiting RNA polymerase II and regulating activator interactions (Hasegawa2012Mediator). MED24 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of specific genes, impacting organismal development and homeostasis (Hasegawa2012Mediator).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MED24 gene have been implicated in the development and progression of various cancers. In breast cancer, MED24 is part of the Mediator complex that is crucial for transcriptional regulation. It plays a significant role in the growth of both normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells. Amplification of genes encoding Mediator subunits, including MED24, is common in breast carcinoma, suggesting its importance in tumorigenesis. MED24, along with MED1, is involved in cell cycle progression, as indicated by the upregulation of G1/S-phase progression-related molecules like E2F1 and cyclin D1 (Hasegawa2012Mediator).

In lung cancer, MED24 expression is regulated by ERBB2, a member of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor family. Loss of ERBB2 leads to significant downregulation of MED24, while its expression increases with the deletion of Pten and Smad4. High MED24 expression correlates with lower survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, indicating its oncogenic role. Knockdown of MED24 in human lung cancer cells results in decreased cell growth, highlighting its critical role in tumor cell proliferation (Liu2019ERBB2).

## Interactions
MED24 is a subunit of the human Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with various proteins and subunits within the complex. MED24 is part of the Tail module of the Mediator complex and interacts extensively with other subunits such as MED23 and MED15. These interactions are critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the Tail module (Zhao2021Structure; Tsai2014Subunit).

MED24 also forms a helical bundle with MED15 and interacts with the C-terminus of MED14, indicating its involvement in stabilizing the Mediator complex structure (Zhao2021Structure). The N-terminus of MED24 contains a hydrophobic patch that interacts with the N-terminal domain of MED1, suggesting a role in mediating interactions between the Tail module and other parts of the Mediator complex (Zhao2021Structure).

In mammary gland development and breast carcinoma cell growth, MED24, along with MED1, contributes to estrogen receptor (ER) function. The MED24-containing submodule acts as a magnifier of the ERα-mediated coactivation function of MED1, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation in response to hormonal signals (Hasegawa2012Mediator). These interactions underscore the importance of MED24 in both structural and functional aspects of the Mediator complex.
