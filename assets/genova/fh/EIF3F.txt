# EIF3F

## Overview
The EIF3F gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F, a critical component of the eIF3 complex involved in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a translation initiation factor and plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA, thereby facilitating the commencement of translation. EIF3F is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other components of the eIF3 complex and the ribosome to regulate translation efficiency, which is essential for proper cellular growth and proliferation. Beyond its fundamental role in protein synthesis, EIF3F is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins, influencing pathways related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to DNA damage. Alterations in EIF3F expression have been linked to different cancer types, where it may function as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the cellular context (Marchione2013The; Doldan2007Loss; Esteves2019Nuclear).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (EIF3F) is a component of the eIF3 complex, which is crucial for the initiation of translation. EIF3F contains an MPN (Mpr1p and Pad1p N-terminal) domain, which is important for protein-protein interactions and protein stability (Marchione2013The). This domain is shared with other complexes like the COP9 signalosome and the 19S proteasome, indicating its role in translation inhibition and regulation of protein synthesis and cell growth (Marchione2013The).

Post-translational modifications of EIF3F include the loss of N-terminal methionine, acetylation at Ala-2, and phosphorylation at Ser-258, which may influence its function and interactions within the eIF3 complex (Marchione2013The). Phosphorylation by CDK11p46 during apoptosis affects its association with other eIF3 subunits and its localization (Marchione2013The).

The quaternary structure of EIF3F involves its integration into the eIF3 complex, which forms a stable PCI/MPN octamer (Marchione2013The). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of EIF3F are not provided in the available context. The protein is primarily cytoplasmic, aligning with its role in protein synthesis (Zhou2005PCI).

## Function
EIF3F is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA, facilitating the start of translation. EIF3F is involved in regulating translation efficiency, which is crucial for maintaining proper cellular growth and proliferation. The activity of EIF3F is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences the translation process by interacting with other components of the eIF3 complex and the ribosome. Through its function in the eIF3 complex, EIF3F contributes to the precise control of protein synthesis, impacting various cellular processes and overall organismal health. Its role in translation initiation underscores its importance in cell biology, as it ensures that proteins are synthesized correctly and efficiently, supporting normal cellular functions and growth.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3F gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, overexpression of EIF3F is associated with increased metastasis and a reduction in tumor size, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Esteves2019Nuclear). EIF3F overexpression promotes a migratory phenotype in lung cancer cells by inducing an oxidative shift and stimulating oxidative phosphorylation, which is linked to increased cell migration and invasion (Esteves2019Nuclear).

In contrast, EIF3F is downregulated in pancreatic cancer, where its decreased expression is associated with loss of heterozygosity at its gene locus. This downregulation is linked to increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, indicating a tumor suppressive role (Doldan2007Loss; Wen2012The). Similarly, in melanoma, EIF3F expression is reduced due to allelic loss, contributing to tumorigenesis by removing restraints on protein synthesis (Doldan2008Loss; Marchione2013The).

EIF3F interacts with various cellular pathways, including the mTOR pathway, and its altered expression can lead to deregulation of translation and increased oncogenic protein synthesis, contributing to cancer development (Marchione2013The). These findings highlight the dual role of EIF3F in cancer, acting as both a promoter and suppressor depending on the context.

## Interactions
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) is involved in various protein interactions that influence multiple cellular processes. eIF3f physically interacts with the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor (alpha 1B-ADR), a plasma membrane protein involved in vasoconstriction and cell proliferation. This interaction is stable and promotes adrenoceptor activity upon catecholamine stimulation, suggesting a role in the activation of alpha 1B-ADR, which signals through the Gq/11 family of heterotrimeric G proteins (GutiérrezFernández2015The).

eIF3f also interacts with hypophosphorylated S6K1 and the mTOR/Raptor complex during muscle differentiation, facilitating phosphorylation and regulation of downstream effectors of mTOR (Marchione2013The). In muscle atrophy, eIF3f is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome through its interaction with the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase MAFbx (Marchione2013The).

Additionally, eIF3f participates in the deubiquitination and activation of the Notch 1 protein, requiring the presence of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex (Marchione2013The). It also interacts with the DNA repair-related protein hMSH4, aiding in its stabilization and modulating the DNA damage response by promoting G2/M cell cycle arrest (Chu2013MutS). These interactions highlight eIF3f's multifunctional role beyond protein synthesis.
