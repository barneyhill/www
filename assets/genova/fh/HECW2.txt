# HECW2

## Overview
HECW2 is a gene that encodes the HECT, C2, and WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This enzyme is integral to the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation or functional modification, thereby playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its distinct domains, including a catalytic HECT domain, a Ca2+-dependent C2 domain, and WW domains, which facilitate substrate binding and interaction with other proteins (Lorenz2017Structural; Krishnamoorthy2018E3). HECW2 is involved in maintaining endothelial cell junction stability, regulating angiogenesis, and influencing neurodevelopmental processes by modulating the stability and activity of key proteins such as AMOTL1 and YAP (Choi2016The; Acharya2021Delineating). Mutations in the HECW2 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, underscoring its clinical significance (Berko2016De; Halvardson2016Mutations).

## Structure
HECW2 is a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes a C-terminal HECT domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity and contains a catalytic cysteine residue necessary for ubiquitin transfer (Lorenz2017Structural; Krishnamoorthy2018E3). The HECT domain is composed of two lobes connected by a flexible linker, with the C-lobe playing a crucial role in ubiquitin transfer (Lorenz2017Structural).

HECW2 also features a Ca2+-dependent C2 domain at its N-terminus, which is involved in phospholipid signaling (Krishnamoorthy2018E3). Additionally, it contains two WW domains that interact with proline-rich motifs, facilitating substrate binding (Lorenz2017Structural; Krishnamoorthy2018E3). These WW domains are crucial for presenting target proteins to the catalytic center of the HECT domain (Lorenz2017Structural).

The protein's interaction with PCNA is mediated by a canonical PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box within the HECT domain, with the sequence 'QYLLDAFF' being critical for this interaction (Krishnamoorthy2018E3). The structural organization and domain interactions are vital for HECW2's function in ubiquitination processes.

## Function
The HECW2 gene encodes a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by tagging proteins for ubiquitination, which can lead to their degradation or alter their function. In endothelial cells, HECW2 is involved in maintaining cell junction stability by stabilizing the AMOTL1 protein through K63-linked ubiquitination. This process is essential for maintaining the integrity of endothelial barriers and regulating angiogenesis (Choi2016The). HECW2 also influences the localization and activity of the YAP protein, a transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo pathway, impacting angiogenesis by modulating YAP activity (Choi2016The).

In the brain, HECW2 is expressed in all regions and is involved in neurogenesis and neurodevelopment. It stabilizes and enhances the transcriptional activity of p73, a member of the p53 family, which is crucial for promoting cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and neurodevelopment (Berko2016De; Acharya2021Delineating). HECW2 also targets nuclear proteins such as PCNA and lamin B1 for ubiquitination, regulating their stability and degradation, which is important for DNA replication and repair processes (Krishnamoorthy2018E3). These activities highlight HECW2's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in critical developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HECW2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These mutations are often de novo and have been identified in patients with developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures (Berko2016De; Halvardson2016Mutations). The HECW2 gene is highly intolerant to functional variation, with mutations clustering in regions with low coding variation, particularly around the HECT domain, suggesting a potential gain of function or dominant negative role (Halvardson2016Mutations).

Clinical features associated with HECW2 mutations include movement disorders, behavioral abnormalities, visual impairments, and gastrointestinal issues. Brain MRI findings often show decreased parenchymal volume and cortical dysplasia (Acharya2021Delineating). The gene's variants are predicted to be deleterious to protein function, potentially disrupting normal neuronal development and function (Berko2016De).

HECW2 mutations have also been linked to Rett-like symptoms, including severe ID, hypotonia, and stereotypical hand movements, as well as cortical visual impairment and neurodevelopmental regression (Nakamura2018Rettlike). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in neurodevelopmental disorders and its potential impact on neuronal patterning and protein homeostasis.

## Interactions
HECW2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and lamin B1, mediating their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The interaction with PCNA is facilitated through a canonical PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box within the HECT domain of HECW2. Mutation of key residues in this PIP box significantly reduces the interaction with PCNA, highlighting the importance of this motif for binding (Krishnamoorthy2018E3).

HECW2 also interacts with AMOTL1, a member of the AMOT family, through its WW domains. This interaction stabilizes AMOTL1 via K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is crucial for maintaining endothelial cell junction integrity. Unlike other E3 ligases that target AMOTL1 for degradation, HECW2 promotes its stability and affects its localization to endothelial cell junctions (Choi2016The).

In colorectal cancer, HECW2 interacts with AKT and lamin B1, influencing the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. It mediates the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of lamin B1, which activates the AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting cancer progression and chemoresistance (Li2023HECW2).
