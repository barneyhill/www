# IL1A

## Overview
The IL1A gene encodes the interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) protein, a crucial cytokine involved in mediating inflammatory responses. IL-1α is categorized as a cytokine and functions as both a soluble mediator and a membrane-bound protein, playing a significant role in immune system signaling. Unlike many cytokines, IL-1α is synthesized as a biologically active precursor that does not require further processing to exert its effects. It acts as an 'alarmin', signaling tissue damage and initiating inflammatory responses upon cell necrosis. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including acting as a nuclear transcription factor and participating in the inflammatory loop by promoting the production of other cytokines such as IL-1β. IL-1α's dual functionality and its interactions with receptors and other proteins underscore its importance in maintaining homeostasis and responding to tissue damage (Cavalli2021Interleukin; Di2016Interleukin).

## Structure
The IL1A gene encodes the interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) protein, which is a cytokine involved in inflammatory responses. IL-1α is synthesized as a 31-kDa precursor without a conventional signal peptide, which is characteristic of secreted proteins (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1). The precursor undergoes post-translational processing, where 112 amino acids are cleaved to form a mature 17-kDa protein (Wessendorf1993Identification). Both the precursor and mature forms are biologically active (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1).

The mature IL-1α protein has a trefoil-like tri-dimensional structure composed of 12 to 14 folds of β-pleated sheet (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1). The NH2 terminal region of proIL-1α contains a nuclear localization sequence, which is crucial for its function as an intracellular autocrine messenger (Wessendorf1993Identification; Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1). This sequence includes a cluster of basic amino acids between residues 79 and 86, with lysine 82 being particularly important for nuclear localization (Wessendorf1993Identification).

IL-1α can be myristoylated on lysine residues during posttranscriptional modification, allowing it to be translocated to the cell surface or cleaved to a mature form by membrane-associated calcium-dependent cysteine proteases called calpains (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1).

## Function
Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α) is a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in orchestrating inflammatory responses in healthy human cells. It is constitutively present as a precursor in tissues of mesenchymal origin, particularly in cells with barrier functions such as keratinocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytes (Cavalli2021Interleukin). Unlike IL-1β, which is only produced during inflammation, IL-1α is synthesized as an intracellular precursor that is biologically active without requiring further processing (Cavalli2021Interleukin).

IL-1α functions as an 'alarmin', a type of danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which is released upon cell necrosis to signal tissue damage and induce inflammation (Cavalli2021Interleukin). It acts as a nuclear transcription factor in keratinocytes exposed to ultraviolet light, playing a critical role in local inflammation (Cavalli2021Interleukin). IL-1α is involved in the inflammatory loop, where its release from dying cells is sensed by myeloid cells, leading to IL-1β production and a cascade of inflammatory responses (Cavalli2021Interleukin).

IL-1α is unique in its dual function as both a soluble mediator and a membrane-bound cytokine, allowing it to contribute to both local and systemic inflammatory responses (Cavalli2021Interleukin). It is biologically active at the plasma membrane and can be released by extracellular proteases, functioning in both intracrine and paracrine manners (Di2016Interleukin). This cytokine is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to tissue damage, highlighting its importance in cell biology and organismal outcomes (Cavalli2021Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the IL1A gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory and immune responses. The IL1A gene is implicated in cancer susceptibility, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs3783553 and rs1800587 linked to an increased risk of several cancers, including cervical, colorectal, gastric, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer (Xia2019Effect). The rs3783553 polymorphism, in particular, has been associated with a higher risk of cancer in both Asian and Caucasian populations (Xia2019Effect).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the IL1A gene has been linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with the IL-1A 2,2 genotype have an increased risk for Alzheimer's, potentially due to the gene's role in regulating neuroinflammatory processes (Grimaldi2000Association). 

The IL1A gene is also associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), particularly early-onset pauciarticular JRA. A specific polymorphism at position -889 in the IL-1α gene is more frequently found in patients with this condition, suggesting a role in its pathogenesis (Mcdowell1995A). Additionally, IL1A polymorphisms have been linked to osteoarthritis, with certain variants increasing susceptibility to the disease (Cai2014Relationships).

## Interactions
Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in inflammation and immune responses. IL-1α interacts with the interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1R1) and type II (IL-1R2), with IL-1R1 being the primary receptor for signaling. The precursor form of IL-1α, known as p33, acts as a partial agonist with lower receptor affinity compared to the mature form, p17. p33 requires higher concentrations to bind IL-1R1 and does not effectively induce downstream signaling (Zheng2013Intracellular).

IL-1α can also interact with intracellular IL-1R2, which protects it from cleavage by calpain and other proteases, thereby modulating its activity and controlling necrosis-induced sterile inflammation (Zheng2013Intracellular). Additionally, IL-1α functions as a nuclear transcription factor in keratinocytes and can be cleaved by extracellular proteases to become a soluble mediator, influencing local inflammation (Cavalli2021Interleukin).

Aptamer SL1067 has been developed to specifically bind IL-1α, inhibiting its signaling. This aptamer competes with native receptors for binding to IL-1α, showing higher affinity than IL-1RI and IL-1RII, and acts as an antagonist for IL-1α signaling (Ren2017Structural). The interaction involves a complex network of hydrophobic and polar interactions, contributing to its high specificity and potential therapeutic applications (Ren2017Structural).
