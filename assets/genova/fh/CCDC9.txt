# CCDC9

## Overview
The CCDC9 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 9 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs, which are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions and are involved in various cellular processes, including molecular recognition and protein refolding (Sha2019CCDC9). The CCDC9 protein, composed of 531 amino acids and weighing approximately 59.703 kDa, plays a significant role in cellular function, particularly in sperm motility, where mutations can lead to conditions such as severe asthenozoospermia (Sha2019CCDC9). Additionally, circular RNAs derived from the CCDC9 gene have been implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, acting as tumor suppressors in gastric cancer and showing altered expression in early-stage Parkinson's disease (Luo2020Circular; Whittle2024Earlystage).

## Structure
The CCDC9 gene encodes a protein that is part of the coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein family, characterized by the presence of a conserved coiled-coil motif. This motif is significant in cellular activities, particularly in molecular recognition and protein refolding (Sha2019CCDC9). The CCDC9 protein is approximately 59.703 kDa in weight and consists of 531 amino acids (Sha2019CCDC9). The coiled-coil domains typically form alpha-helical structures, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. 

The study identified a novel homozygous variant, c.326C>T:p.Ser109Leu, in the CCDC9 gene, which affects a highly conserved amino acid site. This mutation results in a change from the hydrophilic amino acid serine to the hydrophobic leucine, potentially impacting the protein's structure and stability (Sha2019CCDC9). The expression of CCDC9 protein in sperm was significantly reduced in the presence of this variant, suggesting that the mutation may lead to improper folding and degradation of the protein, affecting its function in sperm motility (Sha2019CCDC9). Information on specific splice variants or detailed structural data is limited (Sha2019CCDC9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC9 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A novel homozygous variant, c.326C>T:p.Ser109Leu, in the CCDC9 gene has been associated with severe asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. This variant affects a highly conserved amino acid site, leading to reduced CCDC9 protein expression in sperm, which is thought to contribute to the condition (Sha2019CCDC9).

In the context of cancer, circular RNA derived from the CCDC9 gene, known as circCCDC9, acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. It functions by sponging miR-6792-3p, thereby regulating the expression of the CAV1 gene. Lower levels of circCCDC9 are associated with poorer survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Luo2020Circular).

In Parkinson's disease, circRNAs from the CCDC9 gene have shown reduced expression in early-stage idiopathic cases, indicating a potential link between circRNA dysregulation and the disease. However, the specific role of CCDC9 in Parkinson's disease remains to be fully elucidated (Hudson2023Parkinson’s; Whittle2024Earlystage).
