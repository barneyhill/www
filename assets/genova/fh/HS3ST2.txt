# HS3ST2

## Overview
HS3ST2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 2, which is a member of the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is responsible for the 3-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate (HS) chains, a critical modification that contributes to the structural diversity and functional specificity of HS in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation (Delos2018Heparan). Unlike other sulfotransferases, HS3ST2 is uniquely localized at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with syndecan-2, a proteoglycan involved in cell signaling, suggesting additional roles beyond traditional HS biosynthesis (Delos2018Heparan). The gene is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neuronal cells, indicating a potential role in neurological functions (Thacker2014Heparan). Alterations in HS3ST2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Roperch2016Promoter; SepulvedaDiaz2015HS3ST2).

## Function
HS3ST2 encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 2, which is involved in the modification of heparan sulfate (HS) chains by catalyzing the transfer of a sulfate group to the 3-OH position of N-sulfated glucosamine residues. This modification is crucial for the structural diversity and function of HS in various biological contexts, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation (Delos2018Heparan). HS3ST2 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in neuronal cells within the trigeminal ganglia, suggesting a neurological role for 3-O-sulfation (Thacker2014Heparan).

Unlike other HS3ST isozymes that are typically localized in the Golgi apparatus, HS3ST2 displays an unexpected subcellular localization at the plasma membrane. This suggests that HS3ST2 might have additional roles at the cell surface, potentially interacting with syndecan-2, a proteoglycan involved in cell signaling (Delos2018Heparan). The enzyme's localization and function are influenced by its interaction with syndecan-2, which is necessary for its presence at the plasma membrane (Delos2018Heparan). This unique localization implies that HS3ST2 may participate in processes beyond traditional HS biosynthesis, possibly contributing to cell surface interactions or signaling pathways (Delos2018Heparan).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HS3ST2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers. In Alzheimer's disease, HS3ST2 is significantly overexpressed in the hippocampus, contributing to the abnormal phosphorylation of tau, a hallmark of the disease. This overexpression leads to the accumulation of 3-O-sulphated heparan sulphates, which interact with tau and promote its hyperphosphorylation, exacerbating tau pathology (SepulvedaDiaz2015HS3ST2).

In cancer, HS3ST2 has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Its promoter hypermethylation has been identified as a biomarker for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), where it is used in combination with other markers to enhance diagnostic accuracy (Roperch2016Promoter). Additionally, HS3ST2 overexpression in breast cancer cells has been linked to increased stemness and changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, suggesting a role in cancer stem cell regulation and tumor aggressiveness (Teixeira2020The).

Polymorphisms in HS3ST2 have also been associated with inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indicating its potential role in inflammatory responses (Ouidja2022Variability).

## Interactions
HS3ST2 interacts with syndecan-2, a member of the syndecan family of proteoglycans. This interaction is crucial for the localization of HS3ST2 at the plasma membrane. In HeLa cells, HS3ST2 partially co-localizes with syndecan-2 at the plasma membrane, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed that full-length HS3ST2 associates with syndecan-2, suggesting that the catalytic domain of HS3ST2 is involved in this interaction (Delos2018Heparan). In contrast, in HEK-293 cells, where syndecan-2 expression is low, HS3ST2 is retained in the Golgi apparatus, indicating that high expression of syndecan-2 is necessary for HS3ST2's membrane localization (Delos2018Heparan).

In the nervous system, HS3ST2 is involved in synaptic processes and interacts with synaptic proteins. It is associated with the synaptic surface and interacts with syndecan-2 through its 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate chains. This interaction is part of a complex network of proteins at the synapse, including membrane proteins like Neurexin-1a and -1b, Glypican-1, and Neuroligins, as well as intracellular proteins involved in signaling pathways (Maïza20203Osulfated). These interactions suggest a role for HS3ST2 in synaptic adhesion and neural activity.
