# ACACA

## Overview
The ACACA gene encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCα), a pivotal enzyme in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. As a biotin-dependent carboxylase, ACCα catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, a critical precursor in the fatty acid synthesis pathway (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). This enzyme is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in lipogenic tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and lactating mammary glands, where it plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). The activity of ACCα is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and allosteric mechanisms, which modulate its function in response to nutritional and hormonal signals (Barber2005Structure). Given its central role in lipid biosynthesis, ACCα is a key target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders and certain cancers, where its dysregulation is often observed (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty).

## Structure
The ACACA gene encodes the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC-a) protein, which plays a crucial role in fatty acid biosynthesis. The protein has a predicted molecular mass of 265 kDa and consists of multiple domains, including the biotin carboxylase domain, carboxyltransferase domain, and biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain (Barber2005Structure). The structure of ACC-a is complex, with the catalytic domains accounting for less than half of the molecule, while the rest is divided into five regions. The amino terminus is variable and includes phosphorylation sites that regulate its activity (Barber2005Structure).

ACC-a forms homodimers and can associate into highly active filamentous polymers, which are essential for its catalytic function (Boone2006Regulation). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are critical for its regulation. Specific phosphorylation sites, like Ser-1200 and Ser-1215, play potential regulatory roles (Barber2005Structure).

The ACACA gene exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct N-terminal sequences. These isoforms may have varying regulatory properties and cellular localizations, contributing to the functional diversity of ACC-a in different tissues (Barber2005Structure).

## Function
The ACACA gene encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCα), which plays a pivotal role in fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, a critical step in fatty acid biosynthesis (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). This enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is essential for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is crucial for lipid metabolism in lipogenic tissues such as brown and white fat, liver, and lactating mammary glands (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). ACCα is involved in maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy balance in healthy human cells (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty).

The activity of ACCα is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its function and interaction with other proteins, such as the Breast Cancer Susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). The enzyme's expression is influenced by various factors, including insulin, glucose, thyroid hormones, and catabolic hormones, and is responsive to nutritional status, being low during starvation and increasing with food intake (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). The regulation of ACCα is crucial for the synthesis of fatty acids, which are essential components of cell membranes and energy storage molecules (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACACA gene, which encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly invasive ductal carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer, ACACA is often upregulated, contributing to increased fatty acid synthesis, a hallmark of cancer cell metabolism. Silencing ACACA in breast cancer cell lines leads to growth arrest, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chajès2006AcetylCoA; Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). In prostate cancer, elevated ACACA expression is associated with cell proliferation, and its inhibition can reduce tumor growth (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma, increased ACACA expression is linked with elevated levels of fatty-acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase, enzymes crucial for converting acetyl-CoA to triglycerides, which supports cancer progression (Bhattacharjee2020Fatty). ACACA is also implicated in the formation of the lung pre-metastatic niche in breast cancer, where its downregulation in lung fibroblasts is associated with altered lipid metabolism and increased metastatic potential (Huang2023Involvement). 

These findings highlight the role of ACACA in cancer pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention across various cancer types.

## Interactions
The ACACA gene encodes the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC1) enzyme, which is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. ACC1 interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and function. In mitochondria, ACC1 interacts with ACSF3, a mitochondrial malonyl-CoA synthetase, to supply malonyl-CoA for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). This interaction is essential for protein lipoylation and maintaining mitochondrial morphology (Monteuuis2017A). ACC1 also physically interacts with DLAT, a subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as evidenced by decreased lipoylation of DLAT upon inactivation of ACC1's mitochondrial targeting sequence (Monteuuis2017A).

In the context of cancer, ACC1 is involved in interactions that influence tumor progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ACACA interacts with cancer stem cells (CSCs) and macrophages through CD74 and ITGB1 signaling pathways, promoting tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhengdong2024Identification). These interactions highlight the role of ACACA in cancer cell growth and survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC. While specific physical interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, the protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in cellular processes and disease states.
