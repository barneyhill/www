# CACNG8

## Overview
CACNG8 is a gene that encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 8, also known as TARP γ-8, which is a transmembrane protein. This protein plays a crucial role as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are essential for fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. TARP γ-8 is predominantly expressed in regions such as the hippocampus and cortex, where it is involved in the trafficking and regulation of AMPARs, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) (Peng2021SNP). The proper functioning of TARP γ-8 is vital for cognitive processes and emotional regulation, and its dysregulation has been linked to various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Additionally, mutations in CACNG8 have been associated with diseases such as cone-rod dystrophy and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Donato2022The; Sharma2019Somatic).

## Function
The CACNG8 gene encodes the TARP γ-8 protein, which functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the brain. AMPARs are critical for fast excitatory neurotransmission, and their function is regulated by TARPs, including TARP γ-8. This protein is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, cortex, and subcortical regions, areas essential for emotion generation (Peng2021SNP). TARP γ-8 is involved in the trafficking of AMPARs to and from the synaptic membrane, a process vital for synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP), which underlies learning, memory, and emotion (Peng2021SNP).

In healthy human cells, TARP γ-8 maintains proper synaptic function and emotional regulation by ensuring the correct localization and function of AMPARs at synapses. The protein's role in LTP is crucial for the cellular mechanisms that support cognitive functions and emotional responses (Peng2021SNP). Dysregulation of TARP γ-8 can lead to impaired synaptic plasticity and abnormal neuronal networks, potentially affecting behaviors and emotional states (Peng2021SNP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CACNG8 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), a retinal degenerative disease, a specific variant in CACNG8, c.6819A>T, has been identified. This variant is suggested to decrease the expression of TARP γ-8, a protein that regulates AMPA receptor function, potentially affecting synaptic strength and signal transmission in the retina. This disruption may contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in CORD and impair optic nerve activity, leading to cone cell death (Donato2022The).

In cancer research, a mutation in CACNG8 (p.G404W) was identified in a case of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This mutation, found in ion channel genes, might contribute to the aggressive behavior of the tumor, highlighting the potential role of CACNG8 in cancer progression (Sharma2019Somatic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CACNG8 was identified as one of the calcium channel molecules with elevated expression levels, suggesting its association with cancer progression (Li2023Stromaassociated). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CACNG8, also known as the transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein γ-8 (TARP γ-8), is involved in the regulation and function of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity. It interacts with AMPARs as part of the auxiliary protein complex, influencing their assembly and function. The interaction space between CACNG8 and AMPAR suggests that CACNG8 forms part of distinct protein complexes, interacting exclusively with AMPARs in a manner that is mutually exclusive with other proteins like Frrs1l (GonzalezLozano2020Stitching).

CACNG8 is particularly noted for its role in the hippocampus, where it is enriched and interacts with AMPAR subunits such as Gria1-4. The interaction spaces of CACNG8 and other proteins like Cacng2 partially overlap near the ligand-binding domain of AMPAR, indicating that these proteins do not interact simultaneously with the same AMPAR subunit (GonzalezLozano2020Stitching).

In the context of synaptic protein interactions, CACNG8 is part of a larger network of proteins that are involved in neurotransmission. Its deficiency has been linked to dysregulation in dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways, affecting synaptic function and contributing to ADHD-like behaviors in mice (Bai2022Deficiency).
