# THBS2

## Overview
Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein known as thrombospondin 2, which is a member of the thrombospondin family of matricellular proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating cell-extracellular matrix interactions, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, motility, and survival. Thrombospondin 2 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several distinct domains and is stabilized by calcium ions and disulfide bonds (Carlson2005Structure). Functionally, it is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and is involved in tissue remodeling and wound repair, with significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and connective tissue disorders (Adams2011The; Perruccio2011THBS2). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Hadar2024Heterozygous; Liu2023Systematic).

## Structure
Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) is a secreted glycoprotein involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: three epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) modules, 13 aspartate-rich repeats, and a lectin-like module. These components form three structural regions known as the stalk, wire, and globe. The stalk is composed of two N-terminal EGF-like modules, the wire is formed by aspartate-rich sequences surrounding calcium ions, and the globe contains the lectin-like module (Carlson2005Structure).

The structure of THBS2 is stabilized by 30 bound calcium ions and 18 disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its conformation. The presence of calcium ions is essential for the structural integrity of the protein, as their removal can lead to significant conformational changes (Carlson2005Structure). The EGF-like modules in the stalk have unique cysteine spacing and bind a calcium ion at their interface, contributing to the protein's distinctive interaction sites (Carlson2005Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation are common in THBS2, contributing to its functional diversity. The protein often forms trimers, representing its quaternary structure. Splice variants of THBS2 may exist, adding to its functional complexity.

## Function
Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is involved in modulating cell-matrix interactions, influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, motility, and survival in a context-dependent manner (Perruccio2011THBS2). THBS2 interacts with ECM components and cell surface receptors, such as CD36 and integrins, to regulate these processes (Perruccio2011THBS2).

THBS2 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, primarily through its interaction with the CD36 receptor, which leads to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that result in apoptosis of endothelial cells (Adams2011The). This antiangiogenic activity is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and has potential therapeutic applications in conditions like tumor angiogenesis and diabetic retinopathy (Adams2011The).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, THBS2 is involved in tissue remodeling and wound repair. It is expressed in various tissues, particularly connective tissues and bone, and is regulated by factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Perruccio2011THBS2). THBS2 also contributes to synaptogenesis in the central nervous system, highlighting its diverse functional roles in human biology (Perruccio2011THBS2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the THBS2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and connective tissue disorders. In colorectal cancer (CRC), THBS2 expression is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis and lower survival rates. High THBS2 expression is linked to increased nuclear translocation of HIF1, enhancing lactate metabolism, which may contribute to tumor progression through the HIF1/lactic acid/GPR132 pathway (Liu2023Systematic). In gastric cancer, THBS2 expression is significantly altered, with some studies reporting downregulation associated with poor prognosis and increased microvessel density, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis (Sun2014Down).

THBS2 is also involved in connective tissue disorders. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in THBS2 has been linked to a form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) with prominent vascular features. This variant leads to disorganized collagen fibers and increased vascularity, resulting in symptoms such as aortic root dilatation and spontaneous rupture of large arteries (Hadar2024Heterozygous). In mice, the absence of THBS2 results in connective tissue abnormalities, including disordered collagen fibrillogenesis and increased vascular density, which are reminiscent of EDS (Kyriakides1998Mice).

## Interactions
Thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) is a glycoprotein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. THBS2 interacts with extracellular matrix ligands such as transforming growth factor-beta-1, histidine-rich glycoprotein, TSG6, heparin, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Perruccio2011THBS2). It also binds to cell surface receptors including CD36, CD47, LDL receptor-related protein-1 (via calreticulin), and integrins alpha-V/beta-3, alpha-4/beta-1, and alpha-6/beta-1 (Perruccio2011THBS2). 

In the context of cancer, THBS2 is linked to immune proteins such as CD47 and ECM proteins like MMP-2, suggesting pathways through which it contributes to carcinogenesis (Liao2022Thrombospondin2). Protein-protein interaction analysis has shown that THBS2 interacts with several other proteins, including ADAMTS1, ADAMTS12, ADAMTS2, ADAMTS5, ADAMTSL1, B3GALTL, ITGB1, and LRP1 (Barani2022Transcription). These interactions indicate a complex network of regulatory mechanisms involving THBS2, particularly in the ECM receptor interaction signaling pathway in gastric cancer (Barani2022Transcription). 

THBS2's interactions are crucial for its role in modulating cell-matrix interactions, influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, motility, and survival (Perruccio2011THBS2).
