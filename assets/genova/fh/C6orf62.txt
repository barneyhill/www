# C6orf62

## Overview
C6orf62 is a gene located on chromosome 6 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 62. This protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially through its interactions with other proteins and involvement in signaling pathways. The gene's expression and the protein's activity may have clinical significance, as alterations in C6orf62 have been associated with certain pathological conditions, although further research is necessary to clarify these associations.
