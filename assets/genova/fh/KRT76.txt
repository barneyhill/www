# KRT76

## Overview
KRT76 is a gene that encodes keratin 76, a type II intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and oral epithelia. Keratin 76 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin and oral mucosa. It is involved in the formation of the cytoskeleton in keratinocytes, providing mechanical support and resilience. Additionally, keratin 76 is crucial for the maintenance of tight junctions, interacting specifically with Claudin 1 (CLDN1) to ensure proper localization and function of these junctions, which are essential for the selective permeability of the epidermal barrier (DiTommaso2014Keratin; Sequeira2018Immunomodulatory). Beyond its structural roles, keratin 76 also modulates immune responses, contributing to immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Sequeira2018Immunomodulatory). Alterations in KRT76 expression have been associated with various diseases, including oral squamous cell carcinoma and skin disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Ambatipudi2013Downregulation; DiTommaso2014Keratin).

## Structure
Keratin 76 (KRT76) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This configuration is typical of intermediate filament proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update). The secondary structure of KRT76 is characterized by alpha-helices, which are organized in a heptad repeat pattern. This pattern is essential for the coiled-coil dimer formation, a common feature in keratin proteins (Ho2022Update).

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT76 forms coiled-coil dimers, which can further assemble into higher-order structures. These dimers can be either homodimeric or heterodimeric, contributing to the formation of antiparallel tetramers, which are the building blocks for intermediate filament assemblies (Ho2022Update). The quaternary structure involves these tetramers interacting longitudinally and laterally to form stable filamentous networks.

Post-translational modifications of KRT76 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update). These modifications are crucial for the protein's role in maintaining skin barrier integrity and tight junction function.

## Function
Keratin 76 (KRT76) is a type II intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin and oral mucosa. In healthy human cells, KRT76 is expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and oral epithelia, where it contributes to the formation of the cytoskeleton in keratinocytes, providing mechanical support and resilience (Ambatipudi2013Downregulation; Sequeira2018Immunomodulatory).

KRT76 is essential for the maintenance of tight junctions, which are critical for the selective permeability of the epidermal barrier. It interacts with Claudin 1 (CLDN1), a key component of tight junctions, to ensure its proper localization at the cell membrane. This interaction is vital for maintaining tight junction integrity and, consequently, the skin barrier function (DiTommaso2014Keratin).

The protein is also involved in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis, preventing excessive inflammation. In KRT76-deficient models, there is an increase in systemic inflammation and immune cell infiltration, highlighting its role in regulating inflammation within epithelial tissues (Sequeira2019The; Sequeira2018Immunomodulatory).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KRT76 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and skin disorders. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), KRT76 is significantly downregulated, which correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor progression. This downregulation is associated with an increased risk of developing oral potentially malignant lesions and OSCC, as confirmed by studies using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (Ambatipudi2013Downregulation; Sequeira2018Immunomodulatory). KRT76-null mice exhibit a marked inflammatory phenotype and are more susceptible to carcinogen-induced tumors, particularly in the tongue and squamous stomach, where KRT76 is normally expressed (Sequeira2018Immunomodulatory).

In the context of skin disorders, KRT76 is crucial for maintaining skin barrier function and tight junction integrity. Mutations or inactivation of KRT76 in mice lead to skin-related issues such as hyperpigmentation, impaired wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections. These phenotypes are linked to defective tight junctions, characterized by the mislocalization of the protein CLDN1, which interacts with KRT76 (DiTommaso2014Keratin). The absence of KRT76 results in a hyperproliferative skin disorder reminiscent of psoriasis, with increased immune infiltrates and hyperplasia (DiTommaso2014Keratin).

## Interactions
Keratin 76 (KRT76) is known to interact specifically with the tight junction protein Claudin1 (CLDN1). This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of CLDN1 at tight junctions, which is essential for maintaining skin barrier function. In KRT76 mutant mice, CLDN1 exhibits altered distribution, including broader margins at the cell periphery and partial nuclear localization, although the total protein levels of CLDN1 remain unchanged. This mislocalization is specific to CLDN1, as other tight junction components such as ZO-1 and OCLN are not affected (DiTommaso2014Keratin). The physical interaction between KRT76 and CLDN1 has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a specific association that does not include ZO-1 in the complex (DiTommaso2014Keratin).

The interaction between KRT76 and CLDN1 highlights a novel connection between the intermediate filament cytoskeleton network and tight junctions, suggesting that KRT76 is essential for normal tight junction composition and function. This interaction is significant for epidermal homeostasis and may play a role in skin diseases characterized by tight junction abnormalities (DiTommaso2014Keratin).
