# FERMT3

## Overview
FERMT3 is a gene that encodes the protein kindlin-3, a member of the FERM domain-containing protein family, which plays a pivotal role in integrin activation within hematopoietic cells. Kindlin-3 is characterized by its FERM domain, which is essential for its interaction with the cytoplasmic tails of β-integrins, facilitating cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and signaling processes critical for immune function and hemostasis (Kuijpers2009LAD1variant; Suratannon2015Adaptive). The protein is predominantly active in hematopoietic cells, where it cooperates with talin to stabilize integrin conformations, thereby enhancing cellular interactions and immune responses (Suratannon2015Adaptive). Mutations in FERMT3 are linked to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type III (LAD-III), a disorder characterized by impaired integrin signaling, leading to severe bleeding and immune deficiencies (Harris2012Lessons; Yahya2021Case).

## Structure
The FERMT3 gene encodes the protein kindlin-3, which is characterized by a FERM domain comprising three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3. The F1 domain has a ubiquitin-like fold, the F2 domain is primarily α-helical, and the F3 domain resembles PTB, PH, and EVH1 domains (Bu2021Emerging). The FERM domain forms a compact core, with the F0 and PH domains surrounding it (Bu2021Emerging). The F3 domain contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)-like region that interacts with integrin β cytoplasmic tails (Bu2021Emerging).

The crystal structure of kindlin-3 reveals an extended conformation, although recent studies suggest a clover-leaf conformation (Bu2021Emerging). The full-length kindlin-3 forms a homotrimer through interactions between the PH domain of one protomer and the F3 domain of another, with specific residues stabilizing this structure (Bu2021Emerging). This trimeric form is a minor population compared to the monomeric form, which can bind to the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail with higher affinity (Bu2021Emerging).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, regulate kindlin-3 oligomerization and can induce conformational changes affecting its function (Bu2021Emerging). Variants of FERMT3 can arise from alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Li2024ImmuneRelated).

## Function
The FERMT3 gene encodes the protein kindlin-3, which is crucial for integrin activation in hematopoietic cells. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that facilitate cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, essential for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, migration, and survival (Kuijpers2009LAD1variant). Kindlin-3, a member of the FERM domain-containing protein family, plays a significant role in linking the cytoskeleton to transmembrane proteins. The FERM domain binds to the cytoplasmic tails of β-integrins, which is necessary for the proper functioning of leukocyte and platelet integrins (Kuijpers2009LAD1variant).

In healthy human cells, kindlin-3 is responsible for stabilizing the active conformations of integrin subunits and facilitating ligand binding, which is critical for proper immune function and cellular interactions (Suratannon2015Adaptive). It cooperates with the cytoskeletal protein talin to activate integrins, which are essential for cell adhesion and signaling (Suratannon2015Adaptive). Kindlin-3 is predominantly active in hematopoietic cells, where it facilitates immune cell function and platelet aggregation, impacting processes like wound healing and immune response (Kuijpers2009LAD1variant). The absence of kindlin-3 results in severe hemorrhages and platelet dysfunction, indicating its vital role in hemostasis (Kuijpers2009LAD1variant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FERMT3 gene, which encodes the protein kindlin-3, are associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type III (LAD-III), an autosomal recessive disorder. LAD-III is characterized by a combination of immune deficiencies similar to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I and bleeding disorders akin to Glanzmann thrombasthenia. This condition results from defective activation of integrins β1, β2, and β3 on leukocytes and platelets, leading to impaired primary hemostasis and immune deficiencies (Harris2012Lessons; Yahya2021Case). Patients with LAD-III present with severe bleeding, frequent infections from early infancy, and symptoms such as leukocytosis, delayed umbilical cord detachment, and recurrent bacterial infections (Candelaria2021Novel; Shahid2019A).

The molecular basis of LAD-III involves mutations in FERMT3 that disrupt the expression or function of kindlin-3, impairing integrin signaling on leukocytes and platelets. This disruption leads to defects in leukocyte adhesion and platelet aggregation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the disease (Manukjan2019Novel; Zimmerman2009LAD). The only curative therapy for LAD-III is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which should be performed early to improve prognosis (Candelaria2021Novel).

## Interactions
The FERMT3 gene encodes kindlin-3, a protein that plays a significant role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and signaling. Kindlin-3 interacts with the β subunit of integrins, stabilizing and activating these glycoprotein receptors, which is crucial for the adhesion of leukocytes and platelets (Shahid2019A). It acts synergistically with talin1 to activate integrin αLβ2, enhancing talin-induced activation rather than directly activating integrins (Feng2024Characterization).

Kindlin-3 forms a ternary complex with the integrin β2 cytoplasmic tail and the scaffold protein RACK1, which is involved in integrin outside-in signaling (Feng2024Characterization). The interaction between kindlin-3 and RACK1 is mediated through the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of kindlin-3 and specific blades of RACK1 (Feng2024Characterization). This interaction is crucial for the localization of kindlin-3 to nascent adhesion sites and the lamellipodium of migrating cells (Feng2024Characterization).

Kindlin-3 also oligomerizes into a homotrimer, which adopts a triangular form through head-to-tail interactions. This trimer formation inhibits its ability to bind to integrin cytoplasmic tails, suggesting an auto-inhibitory mechanism (Bu2021Emerging). Mutations that disrupt this oligomerization enhance integrin affinity by allowing the monomeric form of kindlin-3 to bind integrins with higher affinity (Bu2021Emerging).
