# KCTD19

## Overview
KCTD19 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 19, which is part of the KCTD family characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. This protein is involved in protein oligomerization and interactions with other proteins, such as cullin 3 and the receptor GABAB2, and plays a significant role in chromatin modification during meiosis (Oura2021KCTD19; Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). KCTD19 is evolutionarily conserved across various mammals, indicating its structural and functional importance (Oura2021KCTD19). The protein is particularly crucial in male meiosis, where it interacts with zinc finger protein 541 (ZFP541) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), suggesting its involvement in transcriptional repression and chromatin-related processes (Oura2021KCTD19; Oura2021KCTD19a).

## Structure
The KCTD19 protein is part of a family characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is involved in protein oligomerization and interactions with other proteins such as cullin 3 and the receptor GABAB2 (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). The BTB domain is located in the N-terminal region of the protein (Oura2021KCTD19). KCTD19 consists of 950 amino acids and contains a single BTB domain, as identified using SMART software (Oura2021KCTD19).

Recent advances using AlphaFold have revealed that the C-terminal regions of most KCTD proteins, including KCTD19, share a common structural domain despite the lack of sequence similarity (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). However, specific structural predictions for KCTD19 were not performed due to its complex domain organization, which makes oligomerization unlikely (Esposito2022Alphafold). The protein is noted for having a collapsed multidomain structure that includes three BTB domains (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted).

KCTD19 is evolutionarily conserved across various mammals, including cattle, dogs, mice, and humans, indicating its structural and functional importance (Oura2021KCTD19). The protein plays a crucial role in meiosis, particularly in male mice, where it associates with zinc finger protein 541 (ZFP541) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) (Oura2021KCTD19).

## Interactions
KCTD19 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in male meiosis. It forms a complex with zinc finger protein 541 (ZFP541) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests that KCTD19 is involved in chromatin modification, potentially influencing transcriptional repression during meiosis (Oura2021KCTD19; Oura2021KCTD19a). The KCTD19/ZFP541 complex is essential for proper meiotic progression, with KCTD19 being necessary for the metaphase-anaphase transition in spermatocytes (Oura2021KCTD19; Oura2021KCTD19a).

KCTD19 also interacts with other proteins such as CUL9 and DNTTIP1, which have been identified as potential interacting partners through mass spectrometry analyses. These interactions may be significant for future research into the precise functions of KCTD19 in meiosis (Oura2021KCTD19; Oura2021KCTD19a). The interaction with HDAC1, a modulator of chromatin structure, further supports the role of KCTD19 in chromatin-related processes, although HDAC1 levels and localization remain unchanged in KCTD19 knockout models (Oura2021KCTD19a). These findings highlight the importance of KCTD19 in forming multiprotein complexes that are crucial for male fertility.
