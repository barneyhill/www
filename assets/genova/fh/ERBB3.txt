# ERBB3

## Overview
ERBB3, also known as erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The protein product, HER3, is a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Despite its impaired intrinsic kinase activity due to specific amino acid substitutions, HER3 is capable of forming heterodimers with other ErbB family members, such as ERBB2 (HER2), which enhances its signaling capabilities. This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which is vital for cell proliferation and survival (Holbro2003The; Roskoski2014The). HER3 is involved in normal developmental processes and is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary glands and pancreas, indicating its importance in physiological functions (Lemoine1992The; Überall2008The). Additionally, alterations in the ERBB3 gene have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Kilroy2022HER3).

## Structure
ERBB3, also known as erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3, is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The protein structure of ERBB3 includes an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular portion with a protein kinase domain and a carboxyterminal tail. The extracellular domain is divided into four parts: domains I and III, which are leucine-rich and involved in ligand binding, and domains II and IV, which contain cysteine residues for disulfide bond formation and are crucial for dimerization (FrancoGonzalez2012Simulation; Roskoski2014The).

The intracellular kinase domain of ERBB3 is catalytically impaired due to specific amino acid substitutions, such as an asparagine replacing an aspartate in the catalytic loop and a histidine replacing the αC-glutamate. This results in negligible intrinsic kinase activity (SIERKE1997Biochemical; Roskoski2014The). Despite this, ERBB3 can undergo autophosphorylation at a lower rate and serves as a substrate for other kinases, such as the EGF receptor (SIERKE1997Biochemical).

ERBB3 forms heterodimers with other ErbB family members, particularly ErbB2, which enhances its signaling capabilities despite its impaired kinase activity (FrancoGonzalez2012Simulation; Roskoski2014The). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 148 kDa, and its UniProt KB ID is P21860 (Roskoski2014The).

## Function
ERBB3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Despite lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, ERBB3 is crucial for signaling through its ability to form heterodimers with other ErbB family receptors, particularly ERBB2. This dimerization is essential for activating downstream signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which is vital for cell proliferation and survival (Holbro2003The).

In healthy human cells, ERBB3 is involved in normal developmental processes. It plays a role in the proliferation and differentiation of mammary gland cells during pregnancy and postnatal development, indicating its importance in these physiological processes (Überall2008The). Additionally, ERBB3 is expressed in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, suggesting a role in pancreatic function, although its specific function in normal physiology is not fully detailed (Lemoine1992The).

ERBB3 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it participates in ligand-receptor interactions that lead to receptor dimerization and activation, relaying signals to the nucleus to influence cellular processes such as differentiation, adhesion, growth, migration, and apoptosis (Überall2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ERBB3 gene, also known as HER3, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, approximately 5% of cases harbor ERBB3 mutations, with hotspot mutations like V104M and A232V/T potentially influencing metastatic potential. ERBB3 amplifications occur in 2.86% of colon cancers, leading to increased HER3 levels and potentially worse prognosis, particularly in metastatic contexts (Kilroy2022HER3). In breast cancer, HER3 mutations such as E928G, V104L, G284R, and T355I can modulate sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies, suggesting a role in therapeutic resistance (Kilroy2022HER3). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high HER3 expression is associated with shorter survival, and ERBB3 mediates phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in gefitinib-sensitive cell lines (Kilroy2022HER3). HER3 overexpression is linked to brain metastases in lung cancer, and its expression in circulating tumor cells can be used to track disease progression (Kilroy2022HER3). In bladder cancer, HER3 mutations are common, with 10% of cases showing mutations such as M91I and V104M/L/Wfs*18, which may affect sensitivity to targeted therapies like afatinib (Kilroy2022HER3). These findings underscore the role of ERBB3 in cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
ERBB3, also known as HER3, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and participates in various protein interactions crucial for signal transduction. ERBB3 interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) through multiple Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met (YXXM) motifs in its C-terminal domain. These motifs, when phosphorylated, facilitate the binding of ERBB3 to the SH2 domains of p85, which is essential for the activation of PI3K signaling pathways (HELLYER1998ErbB3).

ERBB3 also forms heterodimers with ERBB2 (HER2), which enhances its affinity for ligands such as heregulin and leads to significant tyrosine phosphorylation, a process necessary for effective signal transduction. This interaction is critical for the high-affinity binding and signaling capabilities of the ERBB2/ERBB3 complex (Sliwkowski1994Coexpression).

In addition, ERBB3 can associate with SHC, a signaling protein, which suggests a pathway for activating p21ras through the GRB2-sos complex. However, unlike other members of the EGFR family, ERBB3 does not directly bind to GRB2 (Prigent1994Identification; Fedi1994Efficient). These interactions highlight the unique role of ERBB3 in cellular signaling and growth regulation.
