# TMEM39A

## Overview
TMEM39A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 39A, which is characterized by its eight transmembrane segments and significant roles in cellular processes. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM39A is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in the regulation of collagen secretion and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. It interacts with Sec23A, a component of the COPII vesicle coating complex, to facilitate the transport of procollagen, which is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function (Zhang2021The). Additionally, TMEM39A plays a role in autophagy by regulating the trafficking of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatase SAC1, thereby influencing autophagosome maturation (Miao2020The). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases related to collagen dysregulation and autophagy (Zhang2021The; Miao2020The).

## Structure
TMEM39A is a transmembrane protein characterized by eight transmembrane segments and two large cytoplasmic loops. The molecular structure of TMEM39A includes specific interactions between its second cytoplasmic loop domain and Sec23A, a component of the COPII complex, which is crucial for procollagen secretion (Zhang2021The). The second loop domain of TMEM39A, spanning amino acids 337-420, interacts with the C-terminal region of Sec23A, which is essential for the regulation of collagen secretion and the ER stress response (Zhang2021The).

TMEM39A is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in autophagy-related processes by influencing phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate levels on late endosomes/lysosomes. This occurs through the inhibition of ER-to-Golgi trafficking of the PtdIns4P phosphatase SAC1, promoting the recruitment of the HOPS complex and enhancing autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Zhao2021Machinery).

The protein is also involved in the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus via the autophagy pathway, interacting with viral capsid proteins and playing a regulatory role in viral proliferation (Li2019Transmembrane). TMEM39A undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function in cellular processes (Park2020Myristoylated).

## Function
TMEM39A is a transmembrane protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TMEM39A is involved in the regulation of collagen secretion and the ER stress response. It interacts with Sec23A, a component of the COPII vesicle coating complex, to facilitate the transport of procollagen from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is essential for the proper secretion and processing of collagen, which is vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Zhang2021The).

TMEM39A also regulates autophagy by controlling the trafficking of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) phosphatase SAC1. It acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the ER exit of SAC1, which is crucial for maintaining the spatiotemporal distribution of intracellular PtdIns(4)P pools. This regulation is important for autophagosome maturation and the overall autophagic process, which is a key cellular degradation pathway (Miao2020The).

The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases related to collagen dysregulation and autophagy (Zhang2021The; Miao2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM39A gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and cancers. In the context of autoimmune diseases, TMEM39A polymorphisms have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMEM39A, such as rs12493175 and rs13062955, are linked to a reduced risk of SLE, while others like rs2282175 may increase the risk (Cai2017Association). TMEM39A has also been identified as a susceptibility locus for MS, with significant associations found in genome-wide association studies (McCauley2009Comprehensive; Varadé2011Replication).

In cancer research, TMEM39A is implicated in various types, including glioblastoma and lung cancer. It is overexpressed in glioblastoma, serving as a potential tumor-specific marker and therapeutic target (Park2017Recognition). In lung cancer, a peptide derived from TMEM39A, TMEM39AS41, has shown potential in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation by affecting inflammation and autophagy pathways (Park2020Myristoylated). These findings suggest that TMEM39A plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both autoimmune diseases and cancers, making it a target for further research and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TMEM39A is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It directly interacts with the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. These interactions suggest a specific binding affinity between TMEM39A and these viral proteins, which is crucial for the replication of EMCV (Li2019Transmembrane).

In the context of collagen secretion, TMEM39A interacts with Sec23A, a component of the COPII complex. This interaction is essential for the secretion of procollagen and is mediated by the cytoplasmic loop domain of TMEM39A, as shown by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zhang2020The).

TMEM39A is also implicated in immune system functions and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, where it may interact with proteins involved in immune responses. However, the specific interaction partners in this context are not fully elucidated (Lee2020SURO2TMEM39). These interactions highlight TMEM39A's role in both viral replication and cellular stress responses.
