# RTL10

## Overview
RTL10 is a gene located on chromosome 22, encoding the protein retrotransposon Gag like 10. This protein is categorized as a retrotransposon-related protein, which suggests a potential role in genomic stability and regulation. While the precise biological functions of the RTL10-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in apoptosis through the translation of a BH3 protein, indicating a possible involvement in cellular death pathways. The gene is also part of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is associated with a range of clinical phenotypes, including DiGeorge syndrome and an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Despite its association with these conditions, the specific contributions of RTL10 to their pathogenesis are not yet well understood, necessitating further research to uncover its functional roles and clinical implications (Purcell2023Crossspecies; Forsyth2020Synaptic; Funato2022Craniofacial; ZapataGarcía2022Comparative).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The RTL10 gene, also known as C22orf29, has been studied in the context of various diseases, although specific conditions directly resulting from its mutations or alterations are not well-documented. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), RTL10 is highly expressed, but no correlation with patient survival has been observed. Its role in apoptosis, through the translation of a BH3 protein, suggests potential involvement in cancer pathways, although this has not been fully elucidated in ALL (ZapataGarcía2022Comparative).

RTL10 is also part of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which includes DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). This deletion affects approximately 30 coding genes, including RTL10, and is associated with various clinical phenotypes, although RTL10's specific contribution to these conditions is not detailed (Funato2022Craniofacial).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, RTL10 is included in the 22q11.2 deletion, which is linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. However, the gene's direct role in these disorders remains unclear, as the focus is often on the broader genetic landscape of the deletion (Purcell2023Crossspecies; Forsyth2020Synaptic). Further research is needed to clarify RTL10's clinical significance.
