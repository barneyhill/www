# ROR1

## Overview
The ROR1 gene encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1, a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an extracellular region with an immunoglobulin-like domain, a Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain, and a kringle domain, as well as a cytoplasmic region containing a pseudokinase domain. Despite its classification as a pseudokinase due to reduced catalytic activity, ROR1 plays a crucial role in various signaling pathways, particularly in non-canonical Wnt signaling, which is vital for cell polarity, migration, and differentiation. ROR1 is predominantly expressed during embryonic development and in certain adult tissues, but its aberrant expression is associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhao2021Tyrosine; Guarino2022Crystal; Endo2022The).

## Structure
The ROR1 protein is a type I transmembrane receptor that is part of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. It consists of several distinct domains: an extracellular region, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region. The extracellular portion includes an immunoglobulin-like domain, a Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain, and a kringle domain, which is crucial for protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions (Guarino2022Crystal; Kamrani2019Therapeutic). The kringle domain of ROR1 has a globular architecture with a short antiparallel β-sheet and a small α-helical turn, stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds (Guarino2022Crystal).

The intracellular region of ROR1 contains a tyrosine kinase domain, which is considered a pseudokinase due to the substitution of several conserved amino acids, leading to reduced or null kinase activity (Shabani2015Receptor). It also includes two serine/threonine-rich domains and a proline-rich domain, which are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration and proliferation (Zhao2021Tyrosine).

Post-translational modifications of ROR1 include phosphorylation, and the protein has splice variant isoforms, which may lack certain domains (Kamrani2019Therapeutic). The ROR1 protein is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its important biological functions (DaneshManesh2008Ror1).

## Function
ROR1 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1) is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of non-canonical Wnt signaling. This signaling pathway is essential for regulating cell polarity, migration, proliferation, and differentiation during developmental morphogenesis and tissue regeneration (Endo2022The). ROR1, along with ROR2, acts as a receptor or co-receptor for Wnt5a and related Wnt proteins, facilitating these processes (Endo2022The).

In healthy human cells, ROR1 is primarily expressed in developing tissues and specific adult cell types, such as tissue stem/progenitor cells. Its expression increases following tissue injury, aiding in regeneration or repair (Endo2022The). ROR1 is also involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes cell viability, migration, and invasion, particularly in trophoblast cells, which are crucial for normal placental development and function (Chen2019Downregulation).

At the molecular level, ROR1 contains a pseudokinase domain that, despite being catalytically inactive, plays a role in signaling activation through interactions with other proteins involved in cytoskeleton dynamics and various signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Rho GTPase signaling (Raivola2022New). These interactions suggest that ROR1 contributes to cytoskeleton reorganization and glycoproteome regulation, supporting its pro-survival functions in cells (Raivola2022New).

## Clinical Significance
ROR1 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression, which is typically absent in normal adult tissues. In breast cancer, ROR1 is associated with aggressive disease characteristics, particularly in tumors lacking hormone receptors and HER2/neu, leading to shorter median survival for patients. Silencing ROR1 in breast cancer cell lines increases sensitivity to apoptosis and impairs cell growth, while overexpression results in more aggressive tumor growth (Zhang2012ROR1). In lung adenocarcinoma, ROR1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues and correlates with advanced clinical stages and lymph node metastasis, serving as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival outcomes (Zheng2016ROR1).

ROR1 is also overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where it is linked to pro-survival signaling pathways, including the activation of Rho-GTPases and NF-kB, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Zhao2021Tyrosine). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ROR1 is expressed in a significant percentage of tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. Targeting ROR1 with inhibitors like KAN0441571C has shown effectiveness in inducing apoptosis in NSCLC cells (Ghaderi2023A). These findings highlight ROR1's potential as a therapeutic target in various malignancies.

## Interactions
ROR1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, ROR1 forms complexes with hematopoietic-lineage-cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) upon stimulation by Wnt5a. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of HS1, recruitment of ARHGEF1, and activation of RhoA, enhancing cell migration (Hasan2017Wnt5a). The proline-rich domain (PRD) of ROR1, particularly proline-841, is crucial for its association with HS1, while mutations at this site impair the interaction and subsequent cellular responses (Hasan2017Wnt5a).

ROR1 also forms heterooligomers with ROR2 in response to Wnt5a, which is essential for leukemia cell chemotaxis and proliferation. This interaction recruits guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as ARHGEF1, ARHGEF2, and ARHGEF6, leading to the activation of RhoA and Rac1 (Yu2015Wnt5a). The Kringle domain of ROR1 is necessary for its oligomerization with ROR2, while the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) is involved in Wnt5a binding (Yu2015Wnt5a).

Pharmacological targeting of ROR1 with inhibitors like GZD824 affects its interactome, reducing interactions with proteins involved in Rho GTPase signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics, while maintaining interactions with proteins involved in MAPK signaling (Raivola2022New).
