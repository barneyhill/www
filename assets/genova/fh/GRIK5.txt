# GRIK5

## Overview
The GRIK5 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 5, a component of the kainate-type glutamate receptors, which are a class of ionotropic receptors. These receptors play a pivotal role in synaptic transmission within the central nervous system by mediating excitatory neurotransmission. The protein product of GRIK5, known as the KA2 subunit, is integral to the formation of functional heteromeric receptor complexes, as it associates with other subunits such as GluR5-7 to facilitate ion flow across neuronal membranes upon glutamate binding (Chew2001Characterization; Szpirer1994The). Unlike some other receptor subunits, KA2 does not form functional homomeric channels independently but contributes to the unique biophysical properties and agonist selectivity of the heteromeric receptors it forms (Chew2001Characterization). The expression of GRIK5 is predominantly observed in neural tissues, where it is tightly regulated to ensure specificity, and its activity is modulated by various transcriptional elements (Chew2001Characterization). The GRIK5 protein is also involved in synaptic integration and frequency-dependent spike transmission, particularly at the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

## Structure
GRIK5 encodes a subunit of the kainate type glutamate receptors, which are ionotropic receptors involved in synaptic transmission. The primary structure of the GRIK5 protein consists of amino acid sequences that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its overall functionality. 

In terms of quaternary structure, GRIK5 assembles with other subunits to form functional receptor complexes, which are essential for its role in synaptic transmission. The protein contains specific domains, including ligand-binding and transmembrane domains, which are critical for its activity as a receptor. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the protein's function and regulation. 

GRIK5 may also exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which can result in proteins with distinct functions. These structural features and modifications enable GRIK5 to play a significant role in the modulation of synaptic activity and neurotransmission.

## Function
The GRIK5 gene encodes the KA2 subunit of kainate-type glutamate receptors, which are ionotropic receptors involved in synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. These receptors are crucial for excitatory neurotransmission, allowing ions to flow across the cell membrane upon binding glutamate, thereby influencing neuronal communication and plasticity (Chew2001Characterization; Szpirer1994The). The KA2 subunit does not form functional homomeric ion channels on its own but associates with other kainate receptor subunits, such as GluR5-7, to form functional heteromeric receptors with distinct biophysical properties and agonist selectivity (Chew2001Characterization).

GRIK5 is expressed throughout the central nervous system, with varying levels in different brain areas and cell types, suggesting its involvement in diverse neural processes (Chew2001Characterization). The expression of GRIK5 is tightly regulated, ensuring tissue-specific expression, particularly in neural cells, and may involve repression in non-neural cells (Chew2001Characterization). The gene's promoter activity is influenced by intragenic elements, including a silencer and binding sites for nuclear orphan receptor proteins, which contribute to its neural cell specificity (Chew2001Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The GRIK5 gene, encoding the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 5, has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its polymorphisms and alterations in expression. Notably, the rs8099939 polymorphism of GRIK5 is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The C allele of this polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of COPD, particularly among smokers, while the AA genotype is associated with resistance to the disease (Korytina2017Polymorphic). This polymorphism also correlates with smoking behavior, as individuals with the AC genotype tend to have a higher smoking index, indicating a potential interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors like smoking in the development of COPD (Korytina2017Polymorphic).

Beyond respiratory conditions, GRIK5 polymorphisms have been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggest links between GRIK5 variants and bipolar disorder, mental illness, nervous system diseases, and mental retardation, highlighting the gene's broader impact on mental health and cognitive functions (Korytina2017Polymorphic). These associations underscore the significance of GRIK5 in both respiratory and neurological health, suggesting that alterations in this gene may contribute to a range of multifactorial diseases.

## Interactions
The GRIK5 gene encodes the kainate receptor subunit KA2, which is involved in forming functional heteromeric receptors by associating with other subunits from the GluR5-7 family. KA2 does not form functional homomeric ion channels on its own but can associate with GluR6 to form receptor channel complexes in brain cell membranes (Chew2001Characterization). 

The GRIK5 protein, also known as GluK5, is implicated in synaptic transmission and is found in heterotetramers with GluK2 at the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse, where it plays a role in synaptic integration and frequency-dependent spike transmission (Traynelis2010Glutamate). 

Although specific protein interactions for GRIK5 are not detailed extensively, it is suggested that GRIK5 may interact with the PSD95 protein, a scaffolding protein crucial for synaptic function. This interaction is inferred from studies on other GRIK family members, which have shown associations with PSD95 (Hu2022Ultrarare). 

The regulation of GRIK5 expression involves SP1 and SP3 proteins binding to its promoter, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation in neural cells (Chew2001Characterization). These interactions highlight the importance of GRIK5 in neural cell specificity and synaptic function.
