# GLUD1

## Overview
The GLUD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1), a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular metabolism. GDH1 is a hexameric protein involved in the oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia, linking amino acid metabolism with the Krebs cycle and energy production (Spanaki2016Widening; Spanaki2012The). This enzyme is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and is regulated by allosteric modulators such as GTP and ADP (Spanaki2012The). GDH1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain, where it contributes to ammonia detoxification and neurotransmitter metabolism (Spanaki2016Widening). Mutations in the GLUD1 gene are associated with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Kapoor2009Hyperinsulinism–hyperammonaemia; Aftab2023Spectrum).

## Structure
The GLUD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1), which is a hexameric protein composed of six identical subunits. Each subunit of GDH1 includes several distinct domains: the glutamate-binding domain, the NAD+ binding domain, the antenna, the pivot helix, and the C-terminal α-helix (Dimovasili2021Crystal). The antenna region is particularly notable for its role in intersubunit communication, featuring an ascending helix and a descending random coil strand with a small alpha-helix toward the C-terminal end (Zaganas2002Substitution).

The primary structure of GDH1 consists of a sequence of 505 amino acids in its mature form, following the removal of a 53-residue leader peptide (Dimovasili2021Crystal). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and random coils, with specific mutations affecting the helix structure, such as the G446V mutation, which impacts the pivot helix (Luczkowska2020Hyperinsulinism). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation, influenced by the pivot helix's movement during conformational changes (Luczkowska2020Hyperinsulinism). The quaternary structure is a homohexameric assembly, with potential for heterohexamer formation in certain mutant forms (Luczkowska2020Hyperinsulinism).

## Function
The GLUD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (hGDH1), which is crucial for the oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia. This reaction is pivotal in linking amino acid metabolism with carbohydrate metabolism, contributing to the Krebs cycle anaplerosis and energy production (Spanaki2016Widening; Spanaki2012The). hGDH1 is predominantly located in the mitochondria and is involved in maintaining cellular energy balance by modulating glutamate flux through the Krebs cycle, thus influencing ATP production (Spanaki2016Widening).

In pancreatic β cells, hGDH1 plays a role in insulin secretion by modulating the oxidative deamination of glutamate, which is linked to energy production and insulin release (Plaitakis2000Nerve). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by allosteric mechanisms, with GTP acting as a negative modulator and ADP as a positive modulator, ensuring proper energy homeostasis and preventing excessive insulin release (Spanaki2012The).

hGDH1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain, where it contributes to ammonia detoxification, acid/base balance, and neurotransmitter metabolism (Spanaki2016Widening). In the brain, hGDH1 is primarily found in astrocytes, where it helps manage transmitter glutamate, particularly in regions with glutamatergic innervation (Spanaki2016Widening).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1, are associated with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome. This condition is characterized by excessive insulin secretion and elevated blood ammonia levels, often leading to hypoglycemia and neurological symptoms such as seizures and epilepsy (Kapoor2009Hyperinsulinism–hyperammonaemia). The syndrome is caused by activating mutations in GLUD1 that reduce the enzyme's sensitivity to inhibition by guanosine triphosphate (GTP), resulting in increased enzyme activity (Santer2001Novel; Luczkowska2020Hyperinsulinism).

GLUD1 mutations can also lead to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, learning difficulties, and speech delay. These disorders are linked to mutations in specific exons of the gene, which interfere with the normal regulation of GDH activity (Aftab2023Spectrum). In addition to HI/HA syndrome, altered GLUD1 expression has been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its role in disease processes beyond metabolic conditions (Deng2024Energy).

## Interactions
The GLUD1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1), which participates in several interactions with other proteins that modulate its activity. GDH1 is inhibited by the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt4 through ADP ribosylation in mitochondria, a process that may be linked to the biological actions of Sirtuins in extending the cell cycle and prolonging survival (Spanaki2012The). The enzyme also undergoes lipid acid acylation, with palmitoylation shown to inhibit its activity, while proteolytic modification by chymotrypsin creates a super active form of GDH1 (Spanaki2012The).

GDH1 is subject to allosteric regulation by nucleotides, with GTP acting as an inhibitor and ADP as an activator. This regulation is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance and is disrupted in certain pathological conditions, such as hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome, where mutations in GLUD1 reduce GTP inhibition (Luczkowska2020Hyperinsulinism). Additionally, GDH1 interacts with endogenous proteins like short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD), which modulate its activity. Mutations in SCHAD can lead to decreased inhibition of GDH1, resulting in conditions similar to HI/HA syndrome (Spanaki2012The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network controlling GDH1 activity.
