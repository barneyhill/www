# CLEC18B

## Overview
CLEC18B is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 18 member B, which is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain, which is involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell adhesion, immune response, and pathogen recognition. As a member of the C-type lectin family, CLEC18B is implicated in the modulation of immune responses and may play a role in host-pathogen interactions. The specific functions and interactions of CLEC18B are still under investigation, but its involvement in immune system pathways suggests potential clinical significance in immune-related disorders.
