# DKK2

## Overview
DKK2, or Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Dickkopf family, which is known for its role in modulating the WNT signaling pathway. The DKK2 protein functions primarily as an antagonist of the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Structurally, the protein is characterized by two cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) that are essential for its interaction with lipids and modulation of WNT signaling. DKK2 is involved in various physiological processes, including bone formation, eye development, and intestinal stem cell regulation. It also has significant implications in cancer biology, where its expression is often altered, affecting tumor progression and serving as a potential biomarker for certain cancers (Hirata2009Wnt; Mukhopadhyay2006Dkk2; Niehrs2006Function).

## Structure
The DKK2 protein is part of the Dickkopf family, which is characterized by the presence of two cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), known as CRD1 and CRD2. Each of these domains contains five disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Wen2023Molecular). The CRD2 domain is particularly important for interacting with lipids and modulating Wnt signaling (Krupnik1999Functional). 

In terms of secondary structure, DKK2 proteins in Aves are noted to have a shorter tertiary structure with fewer α-helices compared to those in humans and mice (Wen2023Molecular). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing, which results in the cleavage of the second cysteine-rich domain (Krupnik1999Functional). 

The DKK2 protein also exhibits variability in its linker region between the CRD1 and CRD2 domains, which is larger in DKK2 compared to DKK3 (Krupnik1999Functional). While specific details on the quaternary structure and splice variant isoforms of DKK2 are not provided, the protein's structural features are essential for its role in inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.

## Function
DKK2 is a member of the Dickkopf family of proteins, which are known to modulate the WNT signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, DKK2 primarily functions as an antagonist of the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway by binding to the LRP5/6 co-receptors, thereby inhibiting signal transduction. This inhibition is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Niehrs2006Function).

In the context of intestinal stem cells, DKK2 is a target of Notch signaling and plays a role in a feedback loop that negatively regulates WNT signaling. This loop involves the activation of Notch signaling in stem cells, which induces DKK2 expression to downregulate WNT signaling in progenitor cells, thus maintaining the balance of cell proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium (Katoh2007WNT).

DKK2 also has distinct roles in other tissues. In bone formation, it is involved in the terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and its absence can lead to defects in bone mineralization (Niehrs2006Function). In eye development, DKK2 is essential for maintaining corneal integrity by inhibiting WNT signaling, preventing the transformation of the corneal epithelium into a stratified epithelium with hair follicles (Mukhopadhyay2006Dkk2).

## Clinical Significance
The DKK2 gene, a member of the Dickkopf family, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), DKK2 is often epigenetically silenced through promoter hypermethylation, leading to decreased expression. This silencing is associated with higher tumor grades and stages, suggesting that DKK2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer progression through apoptotic and cell cycle pathways (Hirata2009Wnt).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DKK2 functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The selective retention of an inactive allele of DKK2, often due to loss of heterozygosity and chromosomal deletions, contributes to the loss of its tumor suppressor function, promoting oncogenesis (Lin2016Selective).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), DKK2 is frequently down-regulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with its inactivation. This epigenetic alteration can be reversed by demethylation treatments, restoring DKK2 expression and inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for CRC screening (MAMELLI2021RNAM; Silva2017Research).

## Interactions
DKK2 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role in modulating the WNT signaling pathway. It binds to the LRP6 receptor, which is crucial for its function in promoting angiogenesis. This interaction leads to the activation of the Cdc42 signaling pathway in endothelial cells, facilitating angiogenic processes such as filopodial extrusion and endothelial cell morphogenesis (Min2011The). DKK2's interaction with LRP6 also results in the formation of an APC/Asef2 complex, which is essential for Cdc42 activation (Min2011The).

In the context of neural crest specification, DKK2 interacts with LRP6 and β-catenin to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, functioning in a GSK3β-independent manner (Devotta2018Dkk2). This interaction is critical for neural crest formation and highlights DKK2's ability to act as an activator of Wnt signaling under specific conditions (Devotta2018Dkk2).

DKK2 can also interact with Kremen proteins, which modulate its inhibitory effects on Wnt signaling. However, the specific details of these interactions are not fully explored in the provided context (Niehrs2006Function).
