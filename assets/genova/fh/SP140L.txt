# SP140L

## Overview
SP140L is a gene that encodes the SP140 nuclear body protein-like, a member of the speckled protein (SP) family, which includes other chromatin readers such as SP100, SP110, and SP140. This protein is characterized by its involvement in chromatin and transcriptional regulation, playing a pivotal role in maintaining immune cell identity and function. SP140L contains several functional domains, including a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), a SAND domain, a plant homeodomain (PHD), and a bromodomain (BRD), which facilitate its interactions with DNA and histones. These interactions are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and immune regulation. Notably, SP140L is not expressed in mice and has evolved recently in primates, with its genetic locus being highly repetitive, which poses challenges for creating mouse models (Fraschilla2020The).

## Structure
The SP140L protein is a member of the speckled protein (SP) family, which includes SP100, SP110, and SP140. These proteins are characterized by their role as chromatin readers, with SP140L containing several key domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), a SAND domain, a plant homeodomain (PHD), and a bromodomain (BRD) (Fraschilla2020The). The CARD domain is involved in protein complex formation, while the SAND domain is associated with DNA binding and protein interactions, featuring a conserved KNWK motif (Fraschilla2020The). The PHD domain is responsible for reading histone methylation, and the BRD domain reads histone acetylation, although it does so atypically due to the absence of a canonical tyrosine residue (Fraschilla2020The).

SP140L is not expressed in mice, having evolved recently in primates, and its genetic locus is highly repetitive, complicating the creation of mouse models (Fraschilla2020The). The presence of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in SP140L suggests potential for phase separation, which may be important for its function in chromatin remodeling and immune regulation (Fraschilla2020The). The specific structural details of SP140L, such as its tertiary and quaternary structures, remain less well-defined.

## Function
SP140L is a member of the speckled protein (SP) family, which functions as chromatin 'readers' in humans. These proteins are involved in chromatin and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in maintaining immune cell identity and function. SP140L, like other SP family members, contains several functional domains, including the SAND domain, plant homeodomain (PHD), caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and a bromodomain (BRD). These domains enable SP140L to bind DNA, read histone methylation and acetylation statuses, and multimerize, which are essential for its function in chromatin interactions (Fraschilla2020The).

SP140L localizes to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, which are dynamic nuclear protein aggregates involved in transcriptional repression. The presence of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in SP140L suggests it may undergo phase separation, a process important for chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation (Fraschilla2020The). The protein's involvement in these processes indicates its significant role in immune regulation, particularly in the context of chromatin remodeling and gene regulation, potentially impacting immune cell function and responses (Fraschilla2020The).
