# PRR18

## Overview
PRR18, or proline rich 18, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by its proline-rich sequence. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to neurodevelopment and mitochondrial function. PRR18 is predicted to localize within the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a role in intracellular signaling or structural organization (Auburger2016MethylArginine). Alterations in the expression and methylation of PRR18 have been observed in studies involving neurodegenerative disorders and autism spectrum disorder, indicating its potential involvement in these conditions (Auburger2016MethylArginine; Mychasiuk2016Genetic). Despite these associations, the specific biological functions and interactions of the PRR18 protein remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Interactions
PRR18 (proline rich 18) is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial biogenesis. In a study on the methyl-arginine profile of the brain in aged pink1-ko+a53t-snca mice, PRR18 was identified as having altered methylation, with a 2.3-fold change observed. This suggests that PRR18 may play a role in the altered protein profiles associated with mitochondrial biogenesis (Auburger2016MethylArginine). PRR18 is predicted to localize in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum and is coexpressed with neurite outgrowth regulators such as Lingo1, indicating potential involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Auburger2016MethylArginine).

In the context of a ketogenic diet treatment in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder, PRR18 showed a significant change in expression, with a log fold change of -0.70 in the temporal cortex. This suggests that PRR18 may be involved in the phenotypic changes related to autism spectrum disorder (Mychasiuk2016Genetic). Despite these findings, specific protein interactions involving PRR18 remain largely unexplored, and its precise functional role in these contexts is not fully understood.
