# GTF3C2

## Overview
GTF3C2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as general transcription factor IIIC subunit 2, which is a crucial component of the transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) complex, which is essential for the transcription of small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III, including tRNAs and 5S rRNA (Turowski2016Transcription). As a nuclear protein, GTF3C2 plays a significant role in the assembly of transcription complexes and the regulation of gene expression, thereby influencing cell growth and proliferation (Peng2020The). The protein's interactions with other transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors underscore its multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular function (Galli2013Genomic). Additionally, GTF3C2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and genetic alterations can impact disease progression and patient survival (Gong2022Genomewide; Anuraga2021Comprehensive).

## Function
GTF3C2 encodes a subunit of the general transcription factor IIIC, which is essential for the transcription of small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly of transcription complexes, facilitating the binding of RNA polymerase III to DNA, which is crucial for the transcription of small, stable RNAs such as tRNAs and 5S rRNA (Turowski2016Transcription). GTF3C2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to cell growth and proliferation by participating in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for these processes (Peng2020The).

In human cells, GTF3C2 is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription by interacting with other transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors. It promotes the occupancy of transcription factors such as TBP, TFIIAα, and p300 at specific gene promoters, thereby influencing transcriptional activity (Peng2020The). The protein's activity is linked to cell proliferation, as its expression is modulated by transcription factors like Sp1, which can enhance or inhibit its transcriptional activity depending on cellular conditions (Peng2020The). The precise function of GTF3C2 in healthy human cells, however, remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
GTF3C2 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in gene transcription and cell proliferation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GTF3C2 exhibits lower expression levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This differential expression is associated with improved disease-specific survival and overall survival, suggesting a protective effect against CRC progression (Anuraga2021Comprehensive). GTF3C2 is also involved in DNA damage-related pathways, which are crucial in CRC development, indicating its role in regulating DNA repair mechanisms and checkpoints (Anuraga2021Comprehensive).

In prostate cancer, particularly in African populations, GTF3C2 has been identified as a novel fusion partner with TMPRSS2, highlighting its involvement in structural variations that contribute to cancer development (Gong2022Genomewide). This fusion is part of a broader pattern of genetic alterations that are more prevalent in African-derived tumors (Gong2022Genomewide).

GTF3C2 is also co-expressed with DCTN1 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where its overexpression is linked to better overall survival in CRC patients, although its specific oncogenic roles in LIHC remain unclear (Ullah2022A). Additionally, GTF3C2-ALK fusions have been identified in Spitz tumors, a type of melanocytic neoplasm, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis through unique genetic alterations (Yeh2015Clinical).

## Interactions
GTF3C2, a component of the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) complex, is involved in several protein interactions essential for transcriptional regulation. It interacts with other subunits of the TFIIIC complex, such as GTF3C4, and plays a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex necessary for RNA polymerase III-driven transcription (Galli2013Genomic). GTF3C2 is also involved in interactions with TFIIIB and TFIIIA, facilitating transcription initiation.

In addition to its role in transcription, GTF3C2 has been identified as interacting with the Prdm5 protein in embryonic stem cells. This interaction suggests a potential role in chromatin organization and insulation, as Prdm5 co-occupies genomic regions with TFIIIC and CTCF complexes (Galli2013Genomic). The presence of ChIP-seq signals for TFIIIC components around Prdm5 peaks indicates that GTF3C2 may participate in chromatin interactions alongside Prdm5.

GTF3C2 has also been identified as an interactor of the giant ubiquitin ligase HERC2, suggesting a role in cellular processes such as protein transport and energy metabolism (Galligan2014Proteomic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of GTF3C2 in transcription regulation and cellular function.
