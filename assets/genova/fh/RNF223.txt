# RNF223

## Overview
RNF223 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 223, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This enzyme is integral to the ubiquitination process, a cellular mechanism that tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Vitulo2017Transcriptome). The protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which is essential for its role in transferring ubiquitin molecules to target proteins (Feng2021Comprehensive). RNF223 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and the response to DNA damage, and is implicated in transcriptional stress management (bao2024increased). Its activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of the cell cycle and signal transduction (Vitulo2017Transcriptome). Additionally, RNF223 has been identified as a novel oncogene in pancreatic cancer and is associated with cancer progression in several malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance (Sun2021Distinct; Feng2021Comprehensive).

## Function
RNF223, or ring finger protein 223, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme involved in the ubiquitination process. This process is crucial for tagging proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Vitulo2017Transcriptome). The ubiquitination activity of RNF223 is facilitated by its RING finger domain, which plays a key role in transferring ubiquitin molecules to target proteins (Feng2021Comprehensive).

In healthy human cells, RNF223 is implicated in several cellular processes, including protein quality control and the response to DNA damage. It is upregulated following the degradation of RPB1, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, suggesting its involvement in managing transcriptional stress and maintaining cellular integrity (bao2024increased). RNF223's activity is likely localized in the cytoplasm, where the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is active, although specific subcellular localization in humans is not detailed (Vitulo2017Transcriptome).

The gene's role in cellular signaling pathways and protein degradation underscores its importance in regulating the cell cycle and signal transduction, contributing to overall cellular function and organismal health (Vitulo2017Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
RNF223 has been identified as a novel oncogene in pancreatic cancer, where it is activated by the transcription factor KLF4. Its elevated expression is associated with cancer growth and migration, making it an unfavorable prognostic marker. Studies have shown that RNF223 promotes cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration in pancreatic cancer cell lines, such as ASPC-1 and PANC-1 (Feng2021Comprehensive). The gene's role in pancreatic cancer is further supported by its involvement in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, cytoskeleton regulation, and cancer progression (Feng2021Comprehensive).

In endometrial cancer, RNF223 mutations have been linked to clinical characteristics, including age, cancer stage, and histology. These mutations are associated with specific histological subtypes of endometrial cancer, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis (Sun2021Distinct).

RNF223 has also been identified as part of a prognostic signature for uterine sarcoma, where its expression is correlated with survival outcomes. This highlights its potential as a prognostic marker in this type of cancer as well (Zhou2019Identification).
