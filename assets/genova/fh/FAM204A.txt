# FAM204A

## Overview
FAM204A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 204 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM204A has been associated with several diseases, including lower-grade glioma, urothelial carcinogenesis, pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential clinical significance as a biomarker or therapeutic target. The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been studied in different tissues, suggesting its involvement in disease pathogenesis and progression (Abdi2023Genomic; SitthiAmorn2015Transcriptome; Zheng2022An; Tsumura2019Establishment).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM204A has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lower-grade glioma (LGG), FAM204A is part of a set of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)-related genes that may serve as prognostic markers. Its expression, along with other genes, was analyzed in glioma and non-tumor brain tissues, suggesting potential clinical significance in glioma prognosis (Zheng2022An).

In urothelial tissues, DNA methylation alterations in the FAM204A gene have been identified, with significant differences in methylation levels between non-cancerous and normal tissues. This suggests a role in the early stages of urothelial carcinogenesis, although the specific clinical significance in terms of cancer risk or progression remains unclear (Tsumura2019Establishment).

In pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), FAM204A is one of the top differentially expressed genes in the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) and risk stratification (SitthiAmorn2015Transcriptome).

Additionally, a deletion overlapping exon 9 of FAM204A has been identified in a family with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting a novel association with ASD, though its clinical significance is not extensively detailed (Abdi2023Genomic).
