# MDH2

## Overview
MDH2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme malate dehydrogenase 2, which is a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the reversible conversion of malate to oxaloacetate, a reaction that is essential for cellular respiration and energy production. The activity of malate dehydrogenase 2 is vital for maintaining metabolic balance and supporting efficient energy metabolism by facilitating the production of NADH, a key electron donor for the electron transport chain (Ban2016A; Eleftheriadis2022Inhibition). Mutations in the MDH2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (AitElMkadem2017Mutations; Cascón2019Pheochromocytomas).

## Function
Malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of malate to oxaloacetate, utilizing NAD+ as a cofactor, which is essential for cellular respiration and energy production in healthy human cells (Ban2016A). This reaction contributes to the production of NADH, a key electron donor for the electron transport chain, facilitating ATP synthesis, which is the primary energy currency of the cell (Eleftheriadis2022Inhibition).

MDH2's activity is integral to maintaining metabolic balance and supporting efficient energy metabolism. By participating in the TCA cycle, MDH2 ensures the continuous supply of NADH, which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates the majority of ATP in cells (Ahmadi2021Synthesis). The enzyme's function is vital for cellular homeostasis, as it helps regulate the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, ensuring that cells can adapt to varying energy demands (ELEFTHERIADIS2015Malate).

In healthy cells, MDH2 supports the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, ensuring efficient energy production and cellular metabolism, which are essential for normal cellular function and survival (Eleftheriadis2022Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MDH2 gene are associated with several severe conditions, primarily affecting the nervous system and kidneys. Early-onset severe encephalopathy is linked to biallelic mutations in MDH2, leading to symptoms such as generalized hypotonia, psychomotor delay, refractory epilepsy, and elevated lactate levels. These mutations result in a deficiency of the enzyme's activity, disrupting the Krebs cycle and causing mitochondrial dysfunction (AitElMkadem2017Mutations).

MDH2 mutations have also been implicated in recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (rFSGS), a kidney disorder. The rs6720 variant in MDH2 is associated with reduced protein expression and podocyte injury, contributing to the development of rFSGS (Shen2022Integrated).

In cancer, MDH2 mutations have been linked to pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, with some variants associated with malignant behavior. These mutations may affect mitochondrial respiration and promote anaerobic glycolysis, contributing to cancer cell proliferation (Calsina2018Role; Cascón2019Pheochromocytomas). A rare MDH2 variant has been associated with predisposition to recurrent breast cancer in a high-risk pedigree, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (CannonAlbright2023A).

## Interactions
MDH2 (malate dehydrogenase 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), MDH2 interacts with Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1). This interaction is significant for regulating the sensitivity of ccRCC to ferroptosis, a form of cell death. MDH2 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of FSP1, thereby influencing ferroptosis sensitivity (Feng2024MDH2).

In the context of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, MDH2 interacts with other mitochondrial proteins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MDH2 has been shown to interact with fumarase (FUM1) and citrate synthase (CSY4), forming part of a network of interactions that facilitate sequential reactions in the TCA cycle (Zhang2017Proteinprotein).

MDH2 also interacts with certain compounds, as demonstrated in studies involving benzofuran derivatives. These compounds bind to MDH2, inhibiting its enzymatic activity and potentially affecting mitochondrial oxygen consumption and intracellular oxygen levels. This interaction suggests a dual action mode involving MDH2 and Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90), which could have therapeutic implications in cancer treatment (Cassiano2021Analysis).
