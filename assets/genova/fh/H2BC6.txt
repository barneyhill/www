# H2BC6

## Overview
The H2BC6 gene encodes the H2B clustered histone 6 protein, a member of the histone H2B family, which plays a critical role in the structural organization of chromatin and the regulation of gene expression. Histones are essential components of the nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, and are involved in the packaging of DNA into chromatin, thereby influencing DNA accessibility and transcriptional activity. The H2B clustered histone 6 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcriptional regulation. Alterations in the expression or function of this protein have been associated with several types of cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Pires2023DNA; Bonner2023Pancancer; Ragusa2023Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
The H2BC6 gene, encoding a histone protein part of the H2B family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. Mutations in H2BC6 have been identified in pediatric central nervous system tumors, such as diffuse midline glioma (DMG), where they are associated with high variant allele frequencies, indicating clonality and potential involvement in tumor development (Bonner2023Pancancer). 

In multiple myeloma, H2BC6 is overexpressed, contributing to oncogenic processes by affecting gene expression regulation and genomic stability. This overexpression is linked to the high rate of aneuploidy observed in this cancer type (Ragusa2023Contribution). 

In osteosarcoma, the H2BC6 gene is located in a hypomethylated region with frequent copy number alterations, suggesting a role in the disease's genomic instability (Pires2023DNA). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of H2BC6 in cancer, where its mutations and altered expression levels can disrupt chromatin structure and contribute to tumorigenesis. Understanding these alterations is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving cancer treatment outcomes.
