# THRB

## Overview
The THRB gene encodes the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRβ), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of thyroid hormone action within the body. This receptor is integral to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, which maintains thyroid hormone homeostasis through a feedback loop involving the secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Flamant2013Thyroid; Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). THRβ functions by binding to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) on DNA, thereby modulating the transcription of genes involved in development, growth, and metabolism (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). The receptor's activity is influenced by its interactions with co-activators and co-repressors, which are essential for its role in gene regulation (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). Mutations in the THRB gene can lead to resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Ling2010Aberrant; Sakurai1989Generalized).

## Structure
The THRB gene encodes the thyroid hormone receptor beta, a nuclear receptor protein that plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of thyroid hormones. The primary structure of THRB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific functional domains. The protein includes a highly conserved DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain (LBD), which are essential for its function (Cheng2010Molecular). The LBD is involved in binding thyroid hormones and interacting with corepressors and coactivators, facilitating the regulation of gene expression (Cheng2010Molecular).

The secondary structure of THRB includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of its functional domains. The tertiary structure of THRB forms a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences and regulate transcription (Cheng2010Molecular). THRB can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which enhances its ability to bind to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) and modulate transcriptional activity (Cheng2010Molecular).

THRB has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner and have distinct physiological roles (Cheng2010Molecular). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with other proteins (Cheng2010Molecular).

## Function
The THRB gene encodes the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRβ), which is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in mediating the action of thyroid hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), in healthy human cells. THRβ is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, a critical feedback loop that maintains circulating thyroid hormone levels within a narrow range. This regulation occurs through the secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) by the hypothalamus and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland, which in turn stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (Flamant2013Thyroid; Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid).

THRβ functions by binding to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) on DNA, influencing the expression of target genes. It is particularly important in the negative feedback mechanism that reduces TSH and TRH synthesis and secretion, thereby maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). The receptor is active in the nucleus of cells, where it regulates gene expression related to development, growth, and metabolism (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). THRβ is also involved in specific physiological processes, such as inner ear development and metabolism regulation in the liver (Flamant2013Thyroid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the THRB gene have significant clinical implications. Mutations in THRB can lead to resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a condition characterized by elevated thyroid hormone levels without the expected metabolic response. This is often due to mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the THRB gene, such as a guanine to cytosine replacement resulting in a glycine to arginine substitution, which impairs hormone binding (Sakurai1989Generalized). Another case involved a novel dinucleotide substitution affecting codon 453, leading to a proline to asparagine substitution, which contributed to RTH in conjunction with autoimmune thyroid disease (SkowrońskaJóźwiak2023Resistance).

In cancer, THRB expression is frequently altered. In breast cancer, hypermethylation of the THRB promoter is prevalent, leading to reduced mRNA expression and suggesting a gene silencing mechanism. This methylation is observed in 80% of breast cancer tissues and is associated with reduced THRB expression, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Ling2010Aberrant). In endometrial cancer, loss of THRB expression is linked to improved survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a prognostic marker (Piqué2020Identification). These findings highlight the importance of THRB in various diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in gene regulation. THRB can bind to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) on DNA, influencing the transcription of target genes. This binding can occur in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manners, allowing THRB to regulate transcription with or without the presence of thyroid hormone T3 (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid).

THRB interacts with co-activators and co-repressors, such as SRC-1 and N-CoR, respectively. These interactions are essential for the regulation of gene transcription, with co-repressors involved in repressing gene transcription in the absence of T3 and co-activators recruited in the presence of T3 to activate transcription (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). THRB can form homodimers or heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as RXRs, which influences their binding to specific TREs (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid).

Mutations in THRB can affect these interactions, as seen with the Glu457Ala mutation, which impairs co-activator recruitment and gene regulation, and the Arg429Gln mutation, which affects homodimer formation and co-repressor recruitment (Ortiga-Carvalho2014Thyroid). These mutations provide insights into the mechanisms of THRB-mediated gene regulation.
