# SPIRE2

## Overview
SPIRE2 is a gene that encodes the protein spire type actin nucleation factor 2, which is a critical component in the regulation of actin filament nucleation. This protein is categorized as an actin nucleation factor and is involved in the initiation and elongation of actin filaments, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. The SPIRE2 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular processes, including vesicle transport, cell shape maintenance, and motility. Additionally, SPIRE2 is implicated in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in the assembly of nuclear actin filaments in response to DNA damage, thereby contributing to genomic stability. It also plays a role in host-pathogen interactions, such as the invasion process of Salmonella Typhimurium, by regulating the actin cytoskeleton (Andritschke2016A; Belin2015DNA).

## Structure


## Function
SPIRE2 (spire type actin nucleation factor 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in actin filament nucleation, a fundamental process in cytoskeletal organization. It interacts with actin monomers to initiate the formation of actin filaments, which are essential for various cellular processes such as vesicle transport, cell shape maintenance, and motility. SPIRE2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell division and intracellular trafficking (Andritschke2016A).

In the context of DNA repair, SPIRE2, along with Formin-2 and Spire-1, is involved in the assembly of nuclear actin filaments in response to DNA damage. These filaments are essential for efficient DNA repair, as they facilitate the clearance of double-strand DNA breaks and may alter chromatin mobility or recruit repair factors (Belin2015DNA). The collaborative role of SPIRE2 with other actin nucleators highlights its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular response to genotoxic stress (Belin2015DNA).

SPIRE2 also plays a role in host-pathogen interactions, particularly in the invasion process of Salmonella Typhimurium. It is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the bacterial invasion process (Andritschke2016A).

## Interactions
SPIRE2, a member of the spire family of actin nucleation factors, participates in several key protein interactions that facilitate its role in actin filament nucleation and intracellular transport. SPIRE2 interacts with formin proteins, particularly Formin-2 (FMN2), through a specific interaction motif. This interaction is crucial for actin filament nucleation and elongation, enabling the coordination of actin filament track generation (Kollmar2024Actomyosin). SPIRE2 also interacts with class-5 myosin (MYO5) motor proteins via a conserved sequence motif, which is essential for motor protein activation and vesicle transport (Kollmar2024Actomyosin).

In the context of melanosome transport in melanocytes, SPIRE2 interacts with Rab27a, although this interaction is weaker compared to SPIRE1. This weaker interaction may influence SPIRE2's ability to promote hyper-dispersion of melanosomes (Alzahofi2018Rab27a). SPIRE2 is also involved in the transport of vesicles in mouse oocytes, where it colocalizes with Rab11a-positive vesicles, indicating a role in vesicular trafficking (Jo2018Spire).

SPIRE2's interactions extend to its involvement in the invasion of host cells by Salmonella Typhimurium, where it plays a role in limiting effector protein injection and intracellular replication (Andritschke2016A). These interactions highlight SPIRE2's multifaceted role in cellular processes involving actin dynamics and intracellular transport.
