# RGPD1

## Overview
RGPD1 (RANBP2 like and GRIP domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those associated with the nuclear envelope. The RGPD1 protein is categorized as a component involved in nuclear transport and cytoskeletal organization, playing a crucial role in maintaining nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, which is essential for cell division and gene expression. It is implicated in the organization of microtubules at the kinetochore and may interact with α-tubulin acetyltransferase, suggesting its involvement in microtubule stability and intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the cervix, placenta, and testis, and is localized primarily in nuclear membranes, supporting its functional roles in cellular architecture and function (Girard2022Naive; Wang2024Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
RGPD1 (RANBP2 like and GRIP domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. The RGPD1 protein is associated with the nuclear envelope and plays a significant role in nuclear transport, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular signaling. It is implicated in maintaining nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, which is essential for proper cell division and gene expression (Girard2022Naive).

In terms of molecular function, RGPD1 is involved in the organization of microtubules at the kinetochore, a crucial component of the cell's cytoskeleton. It may interact with α-tubulin acetyltransferase, suggesting a role in microtubule stability, which is vital for various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular transport (Wang2024Genetic). The protein is also predicted to contribute to GTPase activator activity, which is important for regulating intracellular signaling pathways (Girard2022Naive).

RGPD1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with notable enrichment in the cervix, placenta, and testis, and is primarily localized in nuclear membranes (Girard2022Naive). This localization supports its role in nuclear transport and cytoskeletal organization, contributing to the overall cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
RGPD1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its genetic variations and expression alterations. In pulmonary fibrosis, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), RGPD1 is associated with a significant burden of missense and protein-altering variants. These genetic alterations are linked to dysregulated cytoskeletal organization, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (Wang2024Genetic). The gene's expression is significantly upregulated in IPF lung tissue, suggesting its involvement in disease mechanisms related to microtubule stability (Wang2024Genetic).

RGPD1 is also associated with circulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are involved in inflammatory responses. Genetic variants in RGPD1 have been linked to plasma myeloperoxidase-DNA complex levels, a biomarker for NETs, indicating a potential role in inflammatory diseases and cancer (Donkel2021Common).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, RGPD1 is enriched with CGG short tandem repeats, which may contribute to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities. However, the specific role of RGPD1 in these disorders remains largely unexplored (Annear2022NonMendelian).
