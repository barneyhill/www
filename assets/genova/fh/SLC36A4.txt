# SLC36A4

## Overview
SLC36A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 36 member 4, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of small molecules, specifically amino acids, across cellular membranes. This protein functions as a proton-coupled amino acid transporter, playing a critical role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis and supporting cellular metabolism and growth. It is predominantly located in the plasma membrane and is expressed in various tissues, indicating its importance in general cellular function and nutrient uptake. The expression of SLC36A4 is influenced by physiological conditions, such as nutrient availability, highlighting its role in metabolic regulation and nutrient sensing (Sundberg2008The).

## Function
SLC36A4 is a member of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of small molecules across cellular membranes. It functions as a proton-coupled amino acid transporter, facilitating the movement of amino acids into cells, which is crucial for maintaining amino acid homeostasis and supporting cellular metabolism and growth. SLC36A4 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to nutrient uptake and cellular signaling processes (Sundberg2008The).

In healthy human cells, SLC36A4 is expressed broadly across various tissues, indicating its role in general amino acid transport and cellular function. The gene's expression is modulated by different physiological conditions, such as starvation, which significantly down-regulates SLC36A4 in the brainstem, suggesting its involvement in nutrient sensing and metabolic regulation (Sundberg2008The).

The transporter is part of a larger family of solute carriers that share an evolutionary history and are involved in the transport of neutral amino acids. This family plays a significant role in cellular and organismal physiology by regulating the availability of amino acids, which are essential for protein synthesis and other metabolic pathways (Sundberg2008The).
