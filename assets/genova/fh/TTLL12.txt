# TTLL12

## Overview
TTLL12 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin tyrosine ligase like 12, which is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTLL) family. This protein is characterized by a pseudoenzyme structure, featuring a SET-like domain and a TTL-like domain, which are associated with histone methylation and tubulin modification, respectively (Wen2016Identification). TTLL12 is involved in post-translational modifications of tubulin, such as detyrosination, deglutamylation, and polyglutamylation, processes that are crucial for its role in cancer progression (Wasylyk2010Tubulin). The expression of TTLL12 is notably higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Wasylyk2010Tubulin). The gene has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal carcinoma, gastric cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lung adenocarcinoma, where it serves as a potential biomarker for prognosis and treatment outcomes (Patra2023Identification; Mosquera2019The; Heitor2020Downregulated; Sanada2019Involvement).

## Structure
The TTLL12 protein is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTLL) family and is characterized by a pseudoenzyme structure with a SET-like domain and a TTL-like domain. These domains are associated with histone methylation and tubulin modification, respectively (Wen2016Identification). The primary structure of TTLL12 includes a novel transcript isoform, the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform, which features an additional 36 amino acids inserted at the 281st position of the wild-type sequence. This insertion results from a 108-bp nucleotide sequence between exons 5 and 6 (Wen2016Identification).

The secondary structure of TTLL12 shows slight differences in the proportions of α-Helix, β-sheet, and β-turn structures between the wild-type and the 36AA plus isoform (Wen2016Identification). The additional 36 amino acids are located in a disordered region of the protein, which may confer new functions to the isoform (Wen2016Identification).

TTLL12 is involved in post-translational modifications of tubulin, such as detyrosination, deglutamylation, and polyglutamylation, which are crucial for its role in cancer progression (Wasylyk2010Tubulin). The protein's expression is notably higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Wasylyk2010Tubulin).

## Clinical Significance
TTLL12 has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and potential mutations. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), TTLL12 is identified as a critical gene in the progression from ulcerative colitis (UC) to CRC. Its expression is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, but decreases as cancer advances. TTLL12 is also associated with immune cell infiltration in transformed colon tissue, and its lower expression levels correlate with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in CRC (Patra2023Identification).

In gastric cancer (GC), TTLL12 expression is significantly increased in diffuse-type GC, particularly in early-stage tumors. High expression levels are associated with longer survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis in GC (Heitor2020Downregulated).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), TTLL12 is associated with treatment-free survival and time to first treatment. Genetic variants in TTLL12, such as the polymorphism rs9463, have been linked to clinical outcomes, suggesting its role in the clinical evolution of CLL (Mosquera2019The; Mosquera2019Identification).

TTLL12 is also noted as a prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is among the genes potentially regulated by tumor-suppressive miRNAs (Sanada2019Involvement).
