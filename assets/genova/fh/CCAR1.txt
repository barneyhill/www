# CCAR1

## Overview
The CCAR1 gene encodes the protein known as cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator 1, which is a multifunctional coactivator involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring multiple domains such as the S1 RNA binding domain, SAP domain, and leucine zipper domain, which facilitate its diverse functional roles in the cell (Karasu2023CCAR1; Lugano2024Multifaceted). CCAR1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors and coactivators to modulate gene expression, particularly in pathways regulated by nuclear receptors like estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors (Kim2008CCAR1; Ou2014Coregulator). Additionally, CCAR1 is implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels and interactions influencing tumor progression and response to therapy (Sekhar2019A; Johnson2020CCAR1).

## Structure
CCAR1 is a multidomain protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. The protein is over 1,000 amino acids long and contains several functional domains. These include the S1 RNA binding domain, which is associated with RNA-binding capability, and the SAP domain, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, and RNA processing (Karasu2023CCAR1; Lugano2024Multifaceted). The SAP domain is particularly important for preventing the inclusion of poison exons in certain mRNAs, such as FANCA (Karasu2023CCAR1).

CCAR1 also contains a DBC1-like domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a leucine zipper (LZ) domain, a Nudix domain, an EF-hand domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The LZ domain is involved in interactions with NFκB family members, while the Nudix domain acts as a metabolic sensor (Lugano2024Multifaceted). The EF-hand domain, although inactive, is related to calcium-dependent regulation, and the coiled-coil domain facilitates protein-protein interactions (Lugano2024Multifaceted).

CCAR1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which affect its function (Lugano2024Multifaceted). The protein's structure allows for multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its diverse functional roles (Karasu2023CCAR1).

## Function
The CCAR1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a coactivator in transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in the recruitment of the Mediator complex to nuclear receptor transcription complexes. This process is essential for the transcriptional activation of various genes, including those regulated by estrogen receptors (ER) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) (Kim2008CCAR1). CCAR1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, such as p21, in response to DNA damage, indicating its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Kim2008CCAR1).

In healthy human cells, CCAR1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors and coactivators to influence gene expression. It is necessary for the hormone-induced expression of nuclear receptor target genes and the recruitment of Mediator components and RNA polymerase II to gene promoters (Kim2008CCAR1). CCAR1 also plays a role in adipocyte differentiation through the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, where it is essential for the transcriptional activation of the PPARγ gene, a master regulator of adipogenesis (Ou2014Coregulator). These activities highlight CCAR1's involvement in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the CCAR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high levels of CCAR1 are associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, indicating its role as a potential tumor promoter in this context (Johnson2020CCAR1). In colorectal cancer, CCAR1 is crucial for the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, and its depletion suppresses cancer cell growth, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Ou2009Requirement). In breast cancer, CCAR1 is linked to apoptosis induction and is associated with elevated levels of p21, highlighting its complex role in cancer progression (Johnson2020CCAR1).

CCAR1 also plays a role in apoptosis signaling following DNA damage, interacting with proteins like H2AX and p53, which are crucial for DNA repair and apoptotic signaling. Disruption of these interactions can interfere with the apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that targeting CCAR1 interactions could modulate apoptosis signaling and potentially reduce chemotherapy side effects (Sekhar2019A). In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), CCAR1 expression is regulated by Par-4/THAP1 and Notch signaling, affecting cell survival (Muthu2015CARP-1).

## Interactions
CCAR1, also known as cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It functions as a coactivator for nuclear receptors, interacting with the Mediator complex to facilitate transcriptional activation. CCAR1 is recruited to nuclear receptor target gene promoters, where it aids in the recruitment of Mediator components like MED1, although it is not required for the recruitment of the receptors themselves (Kim2008CCAR1).

CCAR1 also interacts with β-catenin, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is both physical and functional, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. CCAR1 binds to specific domains of β-catenin and is recruited to Wnt-responsive enhancers, stabilizing β-catenin's occupancy at these sites (Ou2009Requirement).

In the context of GATA1-mediated transcription, CCAR1 forms a complex with GATA1 and MED1, enhancing transcriptional activation at specific promoters. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of cofactors necessary for transcription initiation (Mizuta2013CCAR1CoCoA).

CCAR1 is also part of a cytosolic complex with AKAP350A and caprin-1, associating with RNA stress granules in a microtubule-dependent manner, indicating its role in mRNA transcript relocation (Kolobova2009Microtubuledependent).
