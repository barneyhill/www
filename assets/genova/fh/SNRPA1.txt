# SNRPA1

## Overview
SNRPA1 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A', a crucial component of the spliceosome, specifically within the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This protein is integral to the pre-mRNA splicing process in eukaryotic cells, where it facilitates the precise removal of introns and the joining of exons to produce mature mRNA, thereby ensuring accurate gene expression and protein synthesis (Fish2021A). Beyond its canonical role in splicing, the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A' is involved in maintaining genome stability and preventing DNA damage by inhibiting the formation of R-loop structures (Tanikawa2016The). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various cancers, where its dysregulation is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2021Prognostic; Jiang2022Elevated).

## Function
SNRPA1 is a component of the spliceosome, specifically the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a critical role in recognizing and binding to specific RNA sequences, facilitating the removal of introns and the joining of exons to generate mature mRNA. This process is crucial for proper gene expression and protein synthesis, maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Fish2021A).

In healthy human cells, SNRPA1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing. It interacts with structured RNA elements known as SNRPA1-associated structural splicing enhancers (S3Es) to modulate exon retention, influencing the splicing of specific genes such as PLEC and ERRFI1. This regulation is significant for cellular processes, including cell mobility and invasion, as evidenced by its role in breast cancer cell metastasis (Fish2021A).

Beyond its role in splicing, SNRPA1 is involved in maintaining genome stability by preventing the formation of R-loop structures, which can lead to DNA damage. It is crucial for the transcription of essential DNA repair factors and the recruitment of homologous recombination factors to DNA damage sites, thereby playing a direct role in DNA repair and genome stability (Tanikawa2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The SNRPA1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in alternative splicing and RNA processing. In breast cancer, elevated SNRPA1 expression is associated with decreased metastasis-free and relapse-free survival. It is linked to poor survival outcomes, even after adjusting for other prognostic factors, and is involved in the splicing of exon 31 of the PLEC gene, which affects metastatic capacity (Fish2021A). In liver cancer, SNRPA1 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2021Prognostic). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high SNRPA1 expression is associated with severe clinical outcomes, including poor overall survival and increased metastasis. It also affects tumor immunity and drug sensitivity, particularly to sunitinib (Jiang2022Elevated). These findings suggest that SNRPA1 plays a critical role in cancer progression and could be a target for therapeutic interventions. Its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of these cancers through its impact on RNA splicing and cellular processes.

## Interactions
SNRPA1, a component of the spliceosome, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and plays a role in alternative splicing regulation. SNRPA1 interacts with structured RNA elements known as SNRPA1-associated structural splicing enhancers (S3Es), which are crucial for its function in promoting exon retention in highly metastatic breast cancer cells (Fish2021A). This interaction is independent of its canonical spliceosomal role, suggesting an extra-spliceosomal function in alternative splicing regulation (Fish2021A).

In human pluripotent stem cells, SNRPA1 interacts with SNRPD1 and PNN, forming a core cluster within the spliceosome that is essential for maintaining pluripotency. These proteins physically interact with each other and with phosphorylated SF3b1, a component of the spliceosome, indicating their cooperative role in pluripotency-specific spliceosome assembly (Kim2017The). SNRPA1 also interacts with CDC5L, part of the PRPF19 complex involved in spliceosome activation, highlighting its role in the regulation of splicing activity (Kim2017The).

In colorectal cancer, SNRPA1 regulates several genes, including PIK3R1, VEGFC, MKI67, and CDK1, through its interactions, impacting cell proliferation and tumor progression (Zeng2019An).
