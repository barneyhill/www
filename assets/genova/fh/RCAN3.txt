# RCAN3

## Overview
RCAN3 (Regulator of Calcineurin 3) is a gene located on human chromosome 1 that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. The RCAN3 protein, a member of the RCAN family, is characterized by its interaction with calcineurin through a conserved calcineurin inhibitor RCAN motif (CIC), which is essential for its regulatory function (Facchin2011Complexity). This protein plays a critical role in modulating calcineurin activity, thereby influencing various physiological processes such as cardiac function, T-cell activation, and angiogenesis (Canaider2010Human; SerranoCandelas2014The). RCAN3 is also implicated in certain pathological conditions, including noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium, highlighting its clinical significance (Hu2024RCAN). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may differ in their ability to interact with calcineurin, thus affecting their functional roles (Facchin2011Complexity).

## Structure
The RCAN3 protein is encoded by the RCAN3 gene located on human chromosome 1. It consists of 241 amino acids and has an estimated molecular weight of 27.5 kDa (Facchin2011Complexity). The protein includes a highly conserved FLISPP motif, characteristic of the RCAN family, and a calcineurin inhibitor RCAN motif (CIC) necessary for calcineurin binding (Facchin2011Complexity). The RCAN3 protein interacts with calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated serine/threonine phosphatase, through the CIC motif, which contains the ELHA calcineurin-binding sequence (Facchin2011Complexity).

RCAN3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with variations in exon composition. Some isoforms, such as RCAN3-2,3,4b,5, lack 10 amino acids due to an in-frame loss of 30 bases, affecting the protein structure (Facchin2011Complexity). The RCAN3-2,3,5 and RCAN3-2,5 isoforms lack the CIC motif due to a frameshift in the exon 5-encoded amino acid sequence, resulting in different C-terminal regions (Facchin2011Complexity). The RCAN3-4 protein, the longest known isoform, is the only one detected at the endogenous level and consists of 241 amino acids (SerranoCandelas2014The).

## Function
RCAN3 (Regulator of Calcineurin 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. In healthy human cells, RCAN3 modulates calcineurin activity, which is crucial for the activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors. These factors translocate to the nucleus to induce gene expression, impacting various physiological processes such as cardiac hypertrophy, T-cell activation, cytokine gene expression, skeletal muscle differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and cell apoptosis (Facchin2011Complexity; SerranoCandelas2014The).

RCAN3 is particularly active in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), where it inhibits cell proliferation under both basal and stimulated conditions, such as those induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). This suggests a role in regulating angiogenic and inflammatory processes, potentially through the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway (Canaider2010Human). The RCAN3 protein interacts with calcineurin through a conserved motif, inhibiting NFAT-dependent cytokine gene expression, which plays a role in T-cell activation (Facchin2011Complexity). RCAN3 also interacts with TNNI3, a cardiac troponin, indicating its involvement in cardiac muscle function (Facchin2011Complexity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RCAN3 gene have been implicated in noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM), a type of cardiomyopathy characterized by prominent trabeculae and intratrabecular recesses. A specific homozygous missense mutation, R223L, in the RCAN3 gene was identified in two infants with NVM, both of whom exhibited persistent bradycardia since the prenatal period. This mutation was not found in 1329 healthy controls, suggesting its potential pathogenicity. In silico analysis indicated that the R223L mutation is deleterious, affecting a highly conserved arginine residue within the calcipressin domain of the RCAN3 protein, which is crucial for its function (Hu2024RCAN).

In a zebrafish model, rcan3 deficiency led to cardiac defects similar to those observed in humans, including lower heart rates and developmental dysplasia of the endocardial and myocardial layers. The RCAN3 R223L variant mRNAs were unable to rescue these heart defects, suggesting a potential loss-of-function variant (Hu2024RCAN). These findings highlight RCAN3 as a novel susceptibility gene for cardiomyopathies, particularly NVM, and underscore the genetic heterogeneity of this condition, with a significant proportion of cases having unknown genetic etiology (Hu2024RCAN).

## Interactions
RCAN3, a member of the human RCAN gene family, is known for its interactions with calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated serine/threonine phosphatase. RCAN3 inhibits calcineurin activity through a specific interaction mediated by the calcineurin inhibitor RCAN motif (CIC), also referred to as the EV-motif. This motif is crucial for binding to calcineurin and is conserved across vertebrate RCAN proteins (Facchin2011Complexity; MartínezMartínez2009The). The interaction involves a hydrophobic cleft in calcineurin, and mutations in this region can disrupt the binding (MartínezMartínez2009The).

RCAN3 also interacts with TNNI3, the human inhibitory cardiac troponin, which is involved in cardiac muscle contraction regulation. The exon 2 product of RCAN3 is sufficient for binding TNNI3, and all identified alternative protein isoforms of RCAN3 interact with TNNI3 (Facchin2011Complexity).

Some RCAN3 isoforms lack the CIC motif due to frameshifts, affecting their ability to bind calcineurin. These isoforms, such as RCAN3-2,5 and RCAN3-2,3,5, are hypothesized not to interact with calcineurin (Facchin2011Complexity).
