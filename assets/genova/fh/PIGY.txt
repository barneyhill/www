# PIGY

## Overview
PIGY is a gene that encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class Y protein, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is essential for the formation of GPI anchors, which are pivotal in attaching proteins to the cell membrane, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as protein localization, cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. The PIGY protein is characterized as a hydrophobic protein with two transmembrane domains, playing a vital role in the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex by directly interacting with PIG-A, the catalytic subunit. This interaction is necessary for the enzymatic activity of the complex, underscoring PIGY's importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Murakami2005The). Mutations in the PIGY gene can lead to GPI anchor deficiencies, which are associated with various clinical conditions, including intellectual disabilities and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Feng2020Copy).

## Structure
The PIGY protein is a 71-amino acid hydrophobic protein involved in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway. It contains two putative transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function within the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex (Murakami2005The). The N- and C-termini of PIGY are localized in the cytoplasm, and the protein's membrane orientation has been confirmed through experiments involving GST-tagged PIGY expressed in CHO cells (Murakami2005The).

PIGY directly associates with PIG-A, the catalytic component of the GPI-GnT complex, and this interaction is essential for the enzymatic activity of the complex (Murakami2005The). The second transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic region are conserved among species, suggesting their importance in the association with PIG-A (Murakami2005The). The protein is encoded by a single mRNA transcript that also encodes another protein, PreY, through a leaky scanning mechanism (Murakami2005The). The precise role of PreY remains unknown, but it is not required for GPI biosynthesis (Murakami2005The).

## Function
PIGY is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway, specifically involved in the function of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex. This complex is responsible for the initial step in GPI anchor formation, which is essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane. PIGY is a hydrophobic protein with two transmembrane domains and is necessary for the enzymatic activity of the GPI-GnT complex. It directly associates with PIG-A, the catalytic subunit of the complex, suggesting that PIGY's presence is required for the complex to become active (Murakami2005The).

In healthy human cells, PIGY is involved in the proper synthesis of GPI anchors, which are critical for various cellular processes, including protein localization, cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. The absence of functional PIGY, as observed in certain cell lines like Daudi, results in defective GPI-anchored protein expression, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Murakami2005The). PIGY's role in the GPI-GnT complex is not only structural but may also involve inducing conformational changes necessary for the activation of the complex (Murakami2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGY gene can lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor deficiencies, which are associated with a range of clinical conditions. These deficiencies can result in intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and developmental delays. Alterations in the expression level of PIGY or disruptions in its normal interactions may also impact cellular processes, contributing to various diseases. In humans, previous research has linked mutations in the PIGY gene to conditions such as deformities, epilepsy, severe stunting, cataracts, and early death (Feng2020Copy). These findings highlight the critical role of PIGY in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential impact when altered. The study of PIGY in sheep has provided insights into its significance, as variations in this gene have been associated with important economic traits, suggesting that similar genetic mechanisms may be relevant in human health (Feng2020Copy). Understanding the clinical significance of PIGY mutations and expression alterations is crucial for developing potential therapeutic strategies for related conditions.

## Interactions
PIGY is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which is essential for the biosynthesis of GPI anchors. PIGY interacts directly with PIG-A, the catalytic subunit of the GPI-GnT complex, suggesting that PIGY plays a crucial role in regulating the enzymatic activity of the complex by binding to PIG-A (Murakami2005The). Although the other components of the GPI-GnT complex can form a complex without PIGY, this complex lacks enzymatic activity, indicating the essential role of PIGY in activating the enzyme (Murakami2005The).

PIGY is not associated with Ras family proteins in mammalian cells, which distinguishes its interactions from those observed in yeast, where a connection between GPI-GnT and ras GTPases has been reported (Murakami2005The). The study of PIGY's interactions also revealed that it does not interact with other proteins outside the GPI-GnT complex, such as those involved in mitochondrial function, despite being bicistronic with PYURF, a gene involved in mitochondrial processes (Rensvold2022Defining). These interactions highlight PIGY's specific role in the GPI biosynthesis pathway.
