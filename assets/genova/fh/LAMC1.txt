# LAMC1

## Overview
The LAMC1 gene encodes the laminin subunit gamma 1, a critical component of the laminin family of glycoproteins, which are integral to the structure and function of basement membranes in various tissues. Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains, and the gamma 1 subunit plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and biological functions of these proteins. As a part of the extracellular matrix, laminin subunit gamma 1 is involved in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling, primarily through interactions with integrin receptors (Domogatskaya2012Functional; Páez2007Physiological). The protein is essential for embryonic development, particularly in the formation of basement membranes, and its absence can lead to severe developmental disorders (Smyth1999Absence). Additionally, LAMC1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Fang2021LAMC1; Darbro2013Mutations).

## Structure
The LAMC1 gene encodes the laminin subunit gamma 1, which is a component of the heterotrimeric laminin proteins. Laminins are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains, forming a triple helical coiled-coil structure that is crucial for their function in the extracellular matrix (Páez2007Physiological). The primary structure of LAMC1 includes a signal peptide and several domains, such as the laminin N-terminal (LN) domain and laminin EGF-like domains, which are important for ligand-receptor interactions (Páez2007Physiological). 

The secondary structure of laminin subunits often involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the stability and function of the protein. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for the formation of a stable trimer assembly (Páez2007Physiological). In terms of quaternary structure, LAMC1 assembles with other laminin subunits to form a functional heterotrimer, which is necessary for proper basement membrane assembly and function (Miner2004LAMININ).

LAMC1 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Splice variants of LAMC1 can result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles in various tissues (Páez2007Physiological).

## Function
LAMC1 encodes the laminin subunit gamma 1, which is a crucial component of laminin proteins involved in the formation and maintenance of basement membranes in various tissues. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains, and they play a significant role in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling through interactions with integrin receptors (Páez2007Physiological). The gamma 1 chain is essential for the structural integrity and function of tissues during development, particularly in the formation of basement membranes (Domogatskaya2012Functional).

In embryonic development, LAMC1 is critical for the assembly of basement membranes, which are necessary for endoderm differentiation and proper tissue organization. The absence of LAMC1 leads to embryonic lethality due to the failure of basement membrane formation and subsequent disorganized tissue structure (Smyth1999Absence). The gamma 1 chain is also involved in the myelination process in the peripheral nervous system, where it supports Schwann cell maturation and axon myelination (Domogatskaya2012Functional).

LAMC1's role extends to maintaining the structural and functional integrity of basement membranes, which are essential for various cellular processes, including differentiation, structural integrity, and survival (Smyth1999Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LAMC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of Dandy-Walker spectrum disorders, mutations in LAMC1, particularly in the EGF-like-6 domain, have been identified as causative factors. These mutations can lead to developmental abnormalities in the cerebellum and associated structures due to decreased protein stability and disrupted interactions with NID1 (Darbro2013Mutations).

LAMC1 expression is significantly upregulated in various cancers, including gliomas, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). In gliomas, high LAMC1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, shorter recurrence-free survival, and overall survival times. It is also linked to advanced tumor staging in other cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (p&gt; Liu2019&lt; High; Bai2024HIF1αmediated). In KIRP, high LAMC1 expression correlates with worse survival, while in KIRC, it is associated with better survival outcomes (Bai2022Comprehensive).

LAMC1 is also associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). Variations in the gene, including specific SNPs, have been linked to POF, potentially affecting laminin-nidogen interactions crucial for basal lamina stabilization (Pyun2012LAMC1).

## Interactions
LAMC1, encoding the laminin subunit gamma 1, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with integrins and dystroglycan, which are essential for cell adhesion and signaling. These interactions activate signaling pathways such as Rho GTPase and MAPK, which are important for bone morphogenesis and matrix deposition (Zhao2024Lamc1). LAMC1 also forms significant interactions with proteins like Dag1 and CD44. Dag1, involved in cell adhesion and structural stability, forms 11 hydrogen bonds with laminin, suggesting its role in balancing osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Similarly, LAMC1's interaction with CD44 is validated through the formation of four hydrogen bonds (Zhao2024Lamc1).

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), LAMC1 is upregulated by TGFβ1 and interacts with the NF-κB pathway, influencing the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL1. This interaction promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration, highlighting LAMC1's role in cancer progression (Fang2021LAMC1). Additionally, LAMC1's interaction with nidogen is crucial for basal lamina stabilization, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to developmental disorders (Pyun2012LAMC1).
