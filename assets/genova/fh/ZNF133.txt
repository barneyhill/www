# ZNF133

## Overview
ZNF133 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 133, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role as a transcriptional repressor. The protein contains multiple C2H2-type zinc finger motifs and a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, both of which are integral to its function in regulating gene expression (Vissing1995Repression; Margolin1994Krüppel-associated). Zinc finger protein 133 interacts with various proteins, including the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) and components of the KAP1 complex, to modulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Li2022ZNF133; Lee2007PIAS1). The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and breast cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response (Jung2019ZNF133; Li2022ZNF133).

## Structure
ZNF133 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its molecular structure, which includes 13 contiguous zinc finger domains encoded by an open reading frame of 1620 nucleotides (Vissing1995Repression). These zinc finger motifs are of the C2H2 type, a common DNA-binding motif, and are crucial for the protein's role in transcriptional regulation (Vissing1995Repression). The protein also contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain at its N-terminus, which is a conserved domain known for its transcriptional repression activity (Margolin1994Krüppel-associated). The KRAB domain is subdivided into A and B boxes, with ZNF133 containing both, contributing to its potent repressor function (Vissing1995Repression).

A variant of ZNF133, known as ZNF133a, has been identified with a deletion at position 662, affecting the junction between the KRAB B subdomain and the finger domain, which may alter its functional properties (Vissing1995Repression). The zinc finger motifs of ZNF133 also interact with the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1), enhancing its transcriptional repressor activity, a process dependent on histone deacetylase activity (Lee2007PIAS1).

## Function
ZNF133, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in human cells. It contains a KRAB domain known for its potent repressor activity, which typically operates through interaction with the transcriptional co-repressor TIF1β. This interaction recruits other proteins that modify chromatin structure, thereby repressing transcription (Lee2007PIAS1). ZNF133 also utilizes its zinc finger motifs, traditionally associated with DNA binding, to enhance its transcriptional repression activity. These motifs interact with the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1), which further augments the repression mediated by ZNF133 (Lee2007PIAS1).

The repression activity of ZNF133 is dependent on histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, as the effect of PIAS1 is relieved by HDAC inhibitors (Lee2007PIAS1). While the specific biological functions of ZNF133 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown, its expression has been noted to increase in certain cancerous conditions and in response to immune stimuli, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis and immune response (Lee2007PIAS1). ZNF133 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell, impacting processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF133 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), the ZNF133 gene has been linked to the responsiveness to infliximab (IFX), a common treatment for IBD. Specifically, the genetic variant rs2228273 in ZNF133 is associated with primary non-response (PNR) to IFX. This variant is predicted to be damaging to the protein's function, potentially affecting the treatment outcomes for IBD patients (Jung2019ZNF133). The study suggests that genetic testing for ZNF133 variants could aid in personalizing treatment for IBD patients (Jung2019ZNF133).

In breast cancer, ZNF133 acts as a transcriptional repressor and is considered a potential tumor suppressor. Lower expression levels of ZNF133 are associated with poorer prognosis and advanced pathological staging in breast cancer patients. ZNF133 suppresses the expression of L1CAM, a gene involved in tumor cell invasion and proliferation. The loss of ZNF133 expression is linked to increased tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its role as a biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Li2022ZNF133).

## Interactions
ZNF133 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression. It interacts with the KAP1 complex, a multiprotein assembly that includes KAP1, HDAC1/2, RBBP4/7, and HP1. This interaction is crucial for ZNF133's function as a transcription repressor, as it co-purifies with these components in breast cancer cells. ZNF133 directly interacts with KAP1, but not with other components of the KAP1 complex, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays (Li2022ZNF133).

In addition to its interaction with the KAP1 complex, ZNF133 also binds to PIAS1, a protein inhibitor of activated STAT1. This interaction occurs through the zinc finger motifs of ZNF133, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells. The KRAB domain of ZNF133 does not coprecipitate with PIAS1, indicating that the zinc finger motifs are primarily responsible for this interaction. PIAS1 enhances the transcriptional repression mediated by ZNF133's zinc finger motifs, suggesting that PIAS1 acts as a co-repressor in this context (Lee2007PIAS1).

These interactions highlight ZNF133's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential involvement in oncogenesis and immune response.
