# ROCK1

## Overview
ROCK1, or Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in a wide array of cellular functions. The protein product of ROCK1 plays a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, influencing processes such as cell migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. It is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the kidney, liver, lungs, and testis, and is also found in smooth muscle and cardiac tissues. The kinase activity of ROCK1 is essential for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, contributing to cellular structural integrity and motility. Additionally, ROCK1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where its dysregulation can lead to disease progression and poor clinical outcomes (Shahbazi2020Targeting; Narayanan2015Rho).

## Structure
The ROCK1 protein structure includes several distinct regions: a dimerization domain (residues 6-72), an N-terminal kinase lobe (73-153), a C-terminal lobe (159-356), and a kinase tail (357-405) (Ansar2021Structurebased). The protein is active in its dimeric form, with the dimerization domain facilitating the formation of a homodimer, which is crucial for its activity (Ansar2021Structurebased). The dimeric form of ROCK1 is more stable than the monomeric form, as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations showing less deviation in root mean square deviation (RMSD) and lower fluctuations in the dimerization and kinase lobe regions (Ansar2021Structurebased).

ROCK1 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular functions, and its structure includes a kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Julian2014Rho-associated). The carboxyl-terminal region acts as an autoinhibitory region, and its deletion results in constitutive activation (Julian2014Rho-associated). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation play a role in its regulation, with specific kinases like Polo-like kinase-1 enhancing its activation (Julian2014Rho-associated). Splice variants can lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Julian2014Rho-associated).

## Function
ROCK1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as apoptosis, growth, migration, and metabolism. It is predominantly expressed in the kidney, liver, lungs, and testis, and is also present in smooth muscles of the vascular structure and heart (Shahbazi2020Targeting). In healthy cells, ROCK1 contributes to the contraction of smooth muscle, nerve regeneration, and neuronal development. It is primarily located in the cytoplasm and translocates to the plasma membrane upon activation (Shahbazi2020Targeting).

ROCK1 is involved in the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in fibroblasts, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in promoting the G1/S transition (Shahbazi2020Targeting). It also plays a role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis development, as well as in acute inflammation and insulin resistance (Shahbazi2020Targeting). In keratinocytes, ROCK1 is essential for maintaining adhesion to fibronectin and regulating terminal differentiation (Lock2009Distinct). The kinase is also involved in actomyosin contraction and cell detachment, highlighting its importance in cytoskeletal dynamics (Shi2013Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ROCK1 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In cancer, specific mutations in ROCK1, such as premature termination of translation at Tyr405 and Ser1126 in breast cancer, and a proline to serine substitution at position 1193 in non-small cell lung cancer, lead to increased kinase activity. These mutations are associated with enhanced cancer progression and poor survival outcomes (Shahbazi2020Targeting; Wei2016Novel). Overexpression of ROCK1 is linked to higher tumor grades and poor survival in breast cancer and osteosarcoma patients (Shahbazi2020Targeting).

ROCK1 is also implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer, where polymorphisms in the gene are associated with disease development and microsatellite instability (Wei2016Novel). In metastatic lobular carcinoma, ROCK1-mediated anoikis resistance is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its role in cancer cell survival (Schackmann2011Cytosolic).

Beyond cancer, ROCK1 is involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease, where its increased expression is observed in blood and brain tissues. Inhibition of ROCK1 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to reduce mutant huntingtin aggregation and improve motor function (Narayanan2015Rho). These findings underscore the potential of targeting ROCK1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ROCK1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It associates with p120-catenin at cell-cell junctions, where it is recruited to adherens junctions (AJs) in a process mediated by p120-catenin. This interaction is important for the formation of junctions and is independent of ROCK1's kinase activity or Rho binding (Smith2012Association).

ROCK1 also interacts with Beclin1, a key regulator of autophagy. During metabolic stress, ROCK1 phosphorylates Beclin1 at threonine 119, facilitating the dissociation of Beclin1 from Bcl-2, which is necessary for autophagy induction (Gurkar2013Identification).

In the context of cell migration, ROCK1 forms complexes with integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1 (ICAP-1) at the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for localizing ROCK1 to the leading and trailing edges of cells, affecting cell migration (Stroeken2006Integrin).

ROCK1 also interacts with Erk1/2 proteins, where it negatively regulates Erk1/2 activation during selenite-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. This interaction is modulated by RhoA, which influences the association between ROCK1 and Erk1/2 (Li2013RhoA).
