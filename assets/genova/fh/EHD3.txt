# EHD3

## Overview
EHD3, or EH domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the EHD protein family, which is characterized by its involvement in endocytic recycling and membrane trafficking. The protein product of EHD3, also referred to as EHD3, is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the early-endosome-to-Golgi transport pathway. It is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its ability to interact with various proteins involved in endosomal trafficking, such as Rab effector proteins and motor proteins like myosin and dynein (Curran2015Endosomebased). EHD3 is also implicated in the regulation of cellular processes such as nutrient uptake, signaling, and hormone synthesis, and it functions as a tumor suppressor in the central nervous system (Chukkapalli2013Ehd3). The protein's structure, which includes a C-terminal EH domain, a central coiled-coil region, and a nucleotide-binding region, is essential for its function in these cellular processes (Naslavsky2005Cterminal; Bhattacharyya2020Cellular).

## Structure
EHD3 is a member of the EHD protein family, characterized by a conserved domain architecture that includes a C-terminal EH domain, a central coiled-coil region, and a nucleotide-binding region near the N-terminus. The EH domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, often binding through NPF motifs in other proteins, and contains calcium-binding EF-hands and a hydrophobic pocket for binding (Naslavsky2005Cterminal). The coiled-coil region facilitates oligomerization, which is crucial for the protein's function in membrane association and trafficking (Naslavsky2005Cterminal).

EHD3, like other EHD proteins, contains a P-loop motif, an ATP/GTP-binding site, and primarily binds ATP, which is hydrolyzed during its function (Naslavsky2005Cterminal). The protein shares a high level of amino acid sequence similarity with other EHD family members, particularly in the G domain, which is similar to classical dynamins but specifically binds ATP due to a unique methionine or glutamine residue (Bhattacharyya2020Cellular).

EHD3 is involved in endocytic recycling and membrane trafficking, with its activity potentially regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in cellular processes like nutrient uptake and signaling (Naslavsky2005Cterminal; Bhattacharyya2020Cellular).

## Function
EHD3 (EH domain containing 3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating early-endosome-to-Golgi transport and maintaining Golgi morphology in healthy human cells. It is involved in the recruitment of proteins to the Golgi, affecting the localization of Arf1 and γ-adaptin, which are essential for biosynthetic transport from the Golgi to lysosomes (Naslavsky2009EHD3). EHD3 is also implicated in the recycling of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) from endosomes to the Golgi, ensuring the proper trafficking of lysosomal enzymes (Naslavsky2009EHD3).

EHD3 functions as a key regulator of retromer-mediated endosome-to-Golgi transport, impacting the localization of retromer subunits SNX1 and SNX2, which accumulate in enlarged peripheral endosomes when EHD3 is depleted (Naslavsky2009EHD3). Despite its critical role in endosome-to-Golgi transport, EHD3 does not significantly affect the secretory pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by the unaffected transport of GFP-VSV-G in EHD3-depleted cells (Naslavsky2009EHD3).

In addition to its role in intracellular transport, EHD3 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, with its loss being associated with gliomas (Chukkapalli2013Ehd3).

## Clinical Significance
EHD3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In gliomas, a type of brain cancer, EHD3 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is significantly downregulated in glioma samples compared to normal brain tissue, suggesting that its loss is an early event in gliomagenesis. The silencing of EHD3 in glioma cells is associated with increased cell growth and invasion, while restoring its expression suppresses tumor growth and promotes apoptosis. This silencing is often due to promoter hypermethylation, and restoring EHD3 expression can be achieved using demethylating agents like 5-Azacytidine (Chukkapalli2013Ehd3).

EHD3 also plays a role in the regulation of EGFR signaling, which is crucial in cancer progression. It accelerates the degradation of EGFR, thereby modulating downstream signaling pathways. Alterations in EHD3 expression or function could impact EGFR-targeted therapies in gliomas (Amessou2016Spatiotemporal).

In Alzheimer's disease, EHD3 is involved in the retrograde transport of BACE1, a key enzyme in amyloid-beta production. Disruption of EHD3 function decreases the transport of BACE1, potentially affecting amyloidogenic processing and contributing to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (BuggiaPrévot2013A).

## Interactions
EHD3 interacts with various proteins involved in endosomal trafficking and cellular processes. It acts as a scaffolding protein, associating with Rab effector proteins and motor proteins such as myosin and dynein, which are crucial for endosome-based protein trafficking (Curran2015Endosomebased). EHD3 specifically interacts with the cytoskeletal membrane adapter protein ankyrin-B (AnkB) through its coiled-coil domain. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of AnkB and its binding partners, including the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and Na/K ATPase, which are vital for cardiac function (Curran2015Endosomebased).

In the context of testosterone synthesis, EHD3 is involved in endocytosis and interacts with clathrin, a protein essential for the formation of coated vesicles. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of steroidogenic genes and testosterone production in Leydig cells (Zhang2021EHD3). EHD3 is also part of a tubular network with EHD1 and interacts with Rab8a, a small GTPase, in cellular recycling pathways. This network is involved in the recycling of clathrin-independent proteins (Roland2007Myosin). These interactions highlight EHD3's role in both cardiac function and hormone synthesis.
