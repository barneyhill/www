# DENND5A

## Overview
The DENND5A gene encodes the DENN domain-containing protein 5A, a crucial component in intracellular trafficking and cell division processes. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, playing a significant role in vesicle transport and membrane trafficking within cells (Fernandes2012Mapping; Banks2024Loss). DENND5A is particularly important in the developing brain, where it contributes to the symmetric cell division of apical neural progenitors, essential for proper brain development (Banks2024Loss). The protein interacts with components of the Crumbs apical polarity complex, such as PALS1 and MUPP1, to maintain cell polarity and ensure accurate mitotic spindle alignment (Banks2024Loss). Mutations in the DENND5A gene are linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Banks2024Loss).

## Structure
The DENND5A protein, also known as Rab6IP1, is involved in vesicle trafficking at the Golgi level and contains several distinct domains. The protein is composed of 1287 residues and includes DENN domains in its N-terminal half, which function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab39 (Fernandes2012Mapping). The C-terminal half of DENND5A contains two RUN domains, RUN1 and RUN2, separated by a PLAT domain. The RUN1 domain acts as an effector for Rab6, while the RUN2 domain interacts with sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), which is involved in protein trafficking between early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (Fernandes2012Mapping; Banks2024Loss).

The crystal structure of Rab6A in complex with the RUN1-PLAT domains of DENND5A has been determined, providing insights into the molecular basis for Rab6-mediated recruitment of DENND5A to the Golgi (Fernandes2012Mapping). The DENN domain is evolutionarily conserved and interacts with Rab GTPases, suggesting a role in guanine nucleotide exchange (Banks2024Loss). The protein's structure can be manipulated to expose binding sites for Rab and components of the Crumbs apical polarity complex, such as MUPP1 and PALS1 (Banks2024Loss).

## Function
The human gene DENND5A encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and cell division processes. It contains a DENN domain, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, crucial for vesicle transport and membrane trafficking within cells (Fernandes2012Mapping; Banks2024Loss). DENND5A is highly expressed in the developing brain and plays a significant role in the symmetric cell division of apical neural progenitors, which is essential for proper brain development (Banks2024Loss).

In healthy cells, DENND5A interacts with components of the Crumbs apical polarity complex, such as PALS1 and MUPP1, to maintain cell polarity and ensure symmetric cell division. This interaction is crucial for the proper alignment of the mitotic spindle, allowing both daughter cells to inherit apical determinants and remain in contact with the stem cell niche (Banks2024Loss). DENND5A also localizes to the centrosome, supporting its role in centrosome dynamics and spindle orientation during cell division (Banks2024Loss).

The protein's function in intracellular trafficking is further highlighted by its involvement in vesicle trafficking at the Golgi level, interacting with Rab6 and Rab11, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and organelle identity (Fernandes2012Mapping; Li2014Cancer). These activities are critical for maintaining the balance between progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, ensuring normal brain development and function (Banks2024Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DENND5A gene are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delays and seizures. Individuals with biallelic DENND5A variants often exhibit a range of neurological phenotypes, including microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, hypertonia, cerebral hypoplasia, and hyperreflexia (Banks2024Loss). The onset of seizures typically occurs around 4.8 months of age and is frequently drug-resistant (Banks2024Loss). Neuroanatomical abnormalities such as dysgenesis of the basal ganglia, cortical malformations, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum are also observed (Banks2024Loss).

The pathogenic variants in DENND5A lead to a loss of function, resulting in reduced protein levels and affecting the symmetric cell division of apical neural progenitors. This disruption contributes to a decreased number and diversity of neurons, which is linked to microcephaly and abnormal neuronal connectivity, potentially leading to seizures (Banks2024Loss). The gene's role in centrosome positioning during mitosis is crucial for maintaining proper cell division and inheritance of apical determinants, which are essential for neurodevelopment (Banks2024Loss).

In some cases, DENND5A-related DEE may exhibit incomplete penetrance, as evidenced by a homozygous truncating variant found in both affected and unaffected siblings, suggesting a rare form of genetic resilience (AlAbdi2023Diagnostic).

## Interactions
DENND5A, a protein encoded by the DENND5A gene, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with components of the apical polarity Crumbs complex, specifically MUPP1 and PALS1. These interactions are facilitated by a GST-tagged peptide flanking the missense variant R710H and are confirmed in HEK293T cells. The R710H variant increases binding to MUPP1 and PALS1 by destabilizing the closed structure of DENND5A, indicating a conformation-dependent interaction (Banks2024Loss).

DENND5A also acts as an effector for the active form of Rab6 through its N-terminal RUN domain (RUN1) and interacts with sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) via its C-terminal RUN domain (RUN2). These interactions are important for protein trafficking between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (Banks2024Loss). The RUN1 domain specifically interacts with the constitutively active forms of Rab6A and Rab6B, functioning as a Rab effector domain (Fukuda2011Genomewide).

DENND5A is involved in centrosome positioning during cell division and interacts with MUPP1 and PALS1 to ensure equal inheritance of apical determinants in daughter cells, which is crucial for maintaining neural stem cell identity (Banks2024Loss).
