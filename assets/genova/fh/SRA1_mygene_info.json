spliced transcript variants. This gene was initially defined as a non-coding RNA, which is a coactivator for several nuclear receptors (NRs) and is associated with breast cancer. It has now been found that this gene is involved in the regulation of many NR and non-NR activities, including metabolism, adipogenesis and chromatin organization. The long non-coding RNA transcripts interact with a variety of proteins, including the protein encoded by this gene. The encoded protein acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to the non-coding RNA.
