# DCAF5

## Overview
DCAF5, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 5, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a substrate receptor within the CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This protein is integral to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as protein turnover, cell cycle progression, and DNA methylation. DCAF5 is particularly involved in the regulation of DNMT1, a DNA methyltransferase, by facilitating its degradation through polyubiquitination. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function, especially during the S phase of the cell cycle. The protein's interactions extend to various cellular pathways, including those involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in certain cancers and other diseases (Leng2018Methylated; RadkoJuettner2024Targeting).

## Function
DCAF5, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 5, functions as a specific subunit of the CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This complex is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, a process crucial for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In particular, DCAF5 plays a significant role in the degradation of DNMT1, a DNA methyltransferase, by interacting with it to facilitate its polyubiquitination-dependent proteolysis. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of L3MBTL3, which binds to monomethylated lysine residues on DNMT1, thereby recruiting the CRL4 DCAF5 complex to target DNMT1 for degradation (Leng2018Methylated).

DCAF5 is active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA methylation. The regulation of DNMT1 by DCAF5 is particularly important during the S phase of the cell cycle, where DNMT1 stability is dynamically controlled to ensure proper DNA replication and methylation patterns (Leng2018Methylated). Through these activities, DCAF5 contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular proliferation, highlighting its critical role in maintaining genomic stability and normal cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the DCAF5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In SMARCB1-mutant cancers, targeting DCAF5 has been shown to stabilize the SWI/SNF complex, which is often destabilized in these cancers, leading to the suppression of cancer cell growth (RadkoJuettner2024Targeting). This suggests that DCAF5 could be a potential therapeutic target for treating these types of cancers (RadkoJuettner2024Targeting).

DCAF5 is also involved in the regulation of the methylated SOX2 protein in mouse embryonic stem cells, where it targets SOX2 for degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of these cells. Alterations in this pathway could have implications for cancer, as overexpression of SOX2 is linked to several cancers (Zhang2019Proteolysis).

In the context of diabetes, genetic variants of DCAF5 have been associated with neuropeptide Y autoantibody levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes, suggesting a role in the autoimmune response and glucose regulation (Mansachs2022Genetic). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of DCAF5 in various diseases.

## Interactions
DCAF5, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 5, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as a substrate receptor for the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. DCAF5 interacts with DDB1 (damage-specific DNA binding protein 1) and CUL4 (cullin 4), facilitating these processes (RadkoJuettner2024Targeting).

In the context of SMARCB1-mutant cancer, DCAF5 has been shown to interact with components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Targeting DCAF5 can stabilize this complex, which includes proteins such as SMARCA4, SMARCC1, and SMARCD2, indicating that DCAF5 may influence the stability and function of the SWI/SNF complex (RadkoJuettner2024Targeting).

Additionally, DCAF5 has been implicated in interactions with various other proteins, as identified through quantitative immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analyses. These studies suggest that DCAF5 may be part of a broader network of protein interactions, potentially influencing multiple cellular pathways and processes (RadkoJuettner2024Targeting). However, specific details on direct physical interactions with nucleic acids are not provided in the available data.
