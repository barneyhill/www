# TLE5

## Overview
TLE5, also known as Amino-terminal Enhancer of Split (AES), is a gene that encodes a member of the transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family of proteins, which are primarily involved in transcriptional regulation. The TLE5 protein functions as a transcriptional corepressor and is characterized as a short-type TLE protein due to its lack of the WD-repeat domain, possessing only the Q and C-terminal domains. This structural distinction allows TLE5 to act as a dominant negative isoform, interfering with the formation of TLE homotetramers necessary for transcriptional repression. TLE5 is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the Wnt and Notch pathways, where it modulates gene expression by interacting with key transcription factors and signaling molecules. Its role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cancer progression underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Hoffman2008Expression; Yu2022Roles).

## Structure


## Function
TLE5, also known as AES, is a member of the transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family of proteins, which function as transcriptional corepressors. Unlike other TLE proteins, TLE5 lacks the WD-repeat domain and contains only the Q and C-terminal domains, making it a short-type TLE protein. It acts as a dominant negative isoform by binding to the Q domain of long-type TLE proteins, inhibiting the formation of the TLE homotetramer necessary for transcriptional suppression (Hoffman2008Expression; Yu2022Roles).

TLE5 is involved in various molecular processes, including the modulation of transcriptional activities of numerous transcription factors. It can either positively or negatively influence gene expression, depending on the context. TLE5 is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, where it may interact with TCF3/4 to downregulate Wnt signaling, a pathway crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Yu2022Roles). In the context of pancreas development, TLE5 is expressed throughout the pancreatic epithelium and is thought to play a role in limiting or preventing Gro/TLE-mediated target repression, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Hoffman2008Expression).

## Clinical Significance
TLE5, also known as AES, plays a significant role in cancer biology, particularly in tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition. Alterations in TLE5 expression are linked to increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis in various cancers. Overexpression of TLE5 inhibits Notch signaling, reducing the expression of Notch target genes like HES1, which is crucial for decreasing tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Conversely, loss of TLE5 enhances tumor invasiveness by activating Notch signaling and increasing the expression of Snail and MMP9, which are associated with cancer metastasis (Yu2022Roles).

In prostate cancer, TLE5 suppresses metastasis by inhibiting both androgen receptor (AR) and Notch signaling pathways. The regulation of TLE5 involves transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, including activation by the transcription factor YY2 and degradation through CK1δ/ε-mediated phosphorylation and SKP2-mediated ubiquitination. CK1δ and CK1ε are often overexpressed in colon cancer, inversely correlating with TLE5 expression. Treatment with CK1 inhibitors can stabilize TLE5, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment (Yu2022Roles).

TLE5's role in modulating inflammatory responses is also noted, as it interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 to inhibit gene expression in T lymphoma cell lines, indicating its potential impact on cancer progression and immune regulation (Yu2022Roles).

## Interactions
TLE5, also known as AES, is a transcriptional corepressor that participates in various protein interactions to modulate gene expression. It interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 (RelA) to inhibit p65-driven gene expression, suggesting a role in modulating NF-κB signaling, which is associated with tumor progression and inflammation (Yu2022Roles). TLE5 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), preventing AR from binding DNA and suppressing ligand-dependent AR target gene expression, thereby inhibiting prostate cancer progression and metastasis (Yu2022Roles).

In the context of Notch signaling, TLE5 overexpression inhibits Notch signaling activation by recruiting TLE1 and HDAC3, converting active Notch transcriptional complexes into repressive ones. This reduces the expression of Notch target genes like HES1 in cancer cells (Yu2022Roles). TLE1 alone cannot suppress Notch signaling but enhances TLE5's suppressive activity by forming nuclear foci with TLE1, TLE5, and HDAC3 (Yu2022Roles).

TLE5 is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it may interact with TCF3/4 to downregulate Wnt signaling (Yu2022Roles). These interactions highlight TLE5's role in regulating gene expression related to inflammation, hormone signaling, and cancer metastasis.
