# ZNF35

## Overview
ZNF35 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 35, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. This protein functions as a transcriptional transactivator, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The ZNF35 protein is primarily active in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and embryonic development. It is mapped to chromosome 3p21-p22, a region frequently deleted in certain cancers, although its direct role in tumorigenesis is not fully understood. The protein's ability to autoregulate its own promoter highlights its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and responses to environmental stimuli (Lanfrancone1992Structural; Gao2004Zinc). Further research is needed to elucidate its complete range of functions and implications in health and disease.

## Structure
The ZNF35 gene encodes a protein that is characterized by the presence of 11 zinc finger domains, which are motifs that facilitate DNA binding. These zinc finger domains are located within the last exon of the gene, specifically encoded by exon 4 (Lanfrancone1992Structural). The primary structure of the ZNF35 protein includes a sequence of 519 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 56.7 kDa (Lanfrancone1992Structural). The zinc finger motifs are highly conserved and are involved in sequence-specific DNA binding, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation (Lanfrancone1992Structural).

The secondary structure of zinc finger proteins typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details for ZNF35 are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would involve the overall 3D conformation of the protein, which is essential for its function as a transcriptional transactivator. There is no information on the quaternary structure of ZNF35, suggesting it may function as a monomer.

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's ability to autoregulate its own promoter indicates a specific regulatory mechanism, highlighting its role in cellular functions such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Lanfrancone1992Structural).

## Function
ZNF35, or zinc finger protein 35, functions as a site-specific DNA-binding transcriptional transactivator. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This regulation is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation (Gao2004Zinc). ZNF35 is mapped to chromosome 3p21-p22, a region that is frequently deleted in certain cancers, such as small cell lung and renal carcinomas, although its direct association with tumorigenesis remains undefined (Gao2004Zinc).

The protein is part of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate its DNA-binding capability. These motifs allow ZNF35 to modulate the transcription of target genes, influencing the transcriptional landscape of the cell. The specific roles of ZNF35 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature, but its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests it plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions and responses to environmental stimuli (Gao2004Zinc). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions and potential implications in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF35, a zinc finger protein gene located on chromosome 3p21, has been implicated in various cancers due to its involvement in chromosomal rearrangements and deletions. It is frequently deleted in lung carcinomas, particularly small cell lung cancer (SCLC), suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Pengue1993YACassisted). The gene is also associated with colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) as a prognosis risk biomarker, with alterations in its expression levels linked to patient outcomes (Yin2020Detecting). 

In addition to cancer, ZNF35 has been studied in the context of male fertility. It is highly expressed in spermatogenic cells, and its deletion in mice leads to premature release of undifferentiated spermatocytes, indicating its importance in fertility (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). The gene has also been identified in a region undergoing a selective sweep in certain Asian populations, potentially affecting male fertility and other traits (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

Furthermore, ZNF35 has been linked to obesity through epigenetic changes, with hypomethylation observed in obese individuals, suggesting a role in metabolic conditions (Almén2012Genome).

## Interactions
ZNF35, a human zinc finger protein, is involved in sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It encodes a protein with 11 zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding, suggesting its role in regulating gene expression (Lanfrancone1992Structural; Pengue1993The). The protein has been shown to act as a transcriptional transactivator, capable of autoregulating its own promoter, indicating a specific interaction with its regulatory DNA sequences (Lanfrancone1992Structural).

The ZNF35 protein is characterized by a 58-kDA polypeptide with an acidic domain at the carboxy terminus, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Pengue1993The). Although specific protein-protein interactions are not detailed in the provided context, the presence of a non-finger domain in its mouse homolog, Zfp105, suggests potential protein-protein interactions similar to other eukaryotic transcription factors (Przyborski1998Differential).

ZNF35 is also implicated in cellular functions such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, and differentiation, which may involve interactions within multiprotein complexes or more transient interactions that modulate gene expression (Lanfrancone1992Structural). However, specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context.
