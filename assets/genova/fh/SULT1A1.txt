# SULT1A1

## Overview
SULT1A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 1A member 1, a cytosolic enzyme involved in the sulfation of a wide array of substrates, including phenolic compounds, drugs, and hormones. This enzyme is a member of the sulfotransferase family, characterized by its role in transferring sulfonate groups from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to various substrates, thereby enhancing their solubility and facilitating excretion (Kurogi2021SULT). SULT1A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in detoxification and chemical defense, but it is also present in other tissues such as the brain, breast, and skin (Riches2009Quantitative; Kurogi2021SULT). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the metabolism of certain drugs and environmental pollutants, and its genetic polymorphisms have been linked to variations in drug response and cancer susceptibility (Kotnis2008Case–control; Daniels2014Pharmacogenetics).

## Structure
The SULT1A1 protein is a member of the sulfotransferase enzyme family, characterized by a single α/β domain. Its structure includes an α-helix surrounded by five β-sheets, which are crucial for substrate binding and are conserved among cytosolic sulfotransferases (Dash2019Structural). The protein's dimerization site is located at the N-terminal end and is hypothesized to be involved in substrate inhibition (Dash2019Structural). 

SULT1A1 contains a PAPS-binding domain, essential for its enzymatic activity, and features a motif similar to the P-loop found in ATP and GTP binding proteins (Dash2019Structural). The enzyme has three substrate binding loops, named Loop1 to Loop3, with residues 81-90, 145-154, and 235-263, respectively, contributing to its hydrophobic and flexible substrate binding site (Dash2019Structural). 

The protein's structure is sphere-shaped, and its active site is hydrophobic, allowing interaction with various uncharged substrates (Dash2019Structural). The R213H polymorphism in SULT1A1 affects the substrate binding by altering the active site, increasing the volume and solvent-accessible surface area, and reducing the binding affinity due to changes in hydrophobic interactions (Dash2019Structural).

## Function
SULT1A1 is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a critical role in the sulfation of a wide range of substrates, including phenolic compounds, drugs, and hormones. This enzyme is primarily active in the liver, where it accounts for more than 50% of total sulfotransferase expression, highlighting its significant role in detoxification and chemical defense (Riches2009Quantitative). SULT1A1 catalyzes the transfer of a sulfonate group from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to substrates, enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion from the body (Kurogi2021SULT).

The enzyme is involved in the metabolism and inactivation of xenobiotics, including drugs and environmental pollutants, by converting them into sulfate conjugates with reduced biological activity (Riches2009Quantitative). SULT1A1 is also expressed in extrahepatic tissues such as the brain, breast, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, platelets, and skin, indicating its widespread role in chemical defense across different tissues (Kurogi2021SULT). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the metabolism of compounds like acetaminophen and minoxidil, with the latter being activated upon sulfation (Kurogi2021SULT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SULT1A1 gene have been associated with various cancers and altered drug responses. The SULT1A1*2 allele, characterized by an Arg213His substitution, is linked to decreased enzyme activity and thermostability, influencing cancer risk. This variant has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly in Asian women, and colorectal cancer, especially among individuals with high red meat consumption (Kotnis2008Case–control; Daniels2014Pharmacogenetics). The SULT1A1*2 allele is also implicated in increased risk for lung cancer and meningiomal brain tumors (Bardakci2007Sulfotransferase; Daniels2014Pharmacogenetics).

The SULT1A1 gene's role in metabolizing carcinogens and hormones suggests that its polymorphisms can modulate cancer susceptibility through interactions with environmental factors like tobacco smoke and dietary carcinogens (Kurogi2021SULT; Daniels2013Sulfotransferase). Variations in SULT1A1 expression and activity may also affect therapeutic outcomes, such as the response to tamoxifen in breast cancer treatment, although findings are inconsistent (Daniels2014Pharmacogenetics). These genetic variations highlight the importance of SULT1A1 in personalized medicine and cancer risk assessment.

## Interactions
SULT1A1 interacts with the cochaperone Aha1, which acts as an autonomous chaperone for the enzyme. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of SULT1A1 expression levels. Aha1 facilitates the folding and stabilization of SULT1A1 independently of the HSP90 chaperone system. Experiments have shown that the depletion of Aha1 leads to a decrease in SULT1A1 protein levels, while overexpression of Aha1 can restore these levels. This suggests that Aha1 plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and proper functioning of SULT1A1 (Liu2022Aha1).

The interaction between SULT1A1 and Aha1 does not involve HSP90, as no direct interaction between SULT1A1 and HSP90 has been observed. This indicates that Aha1 operates independently to regulate SULT1A1, highlighting its unique role in the enzyme's expression and activity (Liu2022Aha1). The binding of Aha1 to newly synthesized SULT1A1 further supports its role as a chaperone that assists in the proper folding and stabilization of the enzyme, ensuring its functionality in metabolic processes (Liu2022Aha1).
