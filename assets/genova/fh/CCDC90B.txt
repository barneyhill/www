# CCDC90B

## Overview
The CCDC90B gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 90B protein, which is primarily localized to the mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial function and integrity. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial protein, and its predicted roles include the regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration and transmembrane transport, although these functions have not been experimentally confirmed (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). Bioinformatics analyses, such as those using I-TASSER/COFACTOR, have been employed to predict the gene ontology terms associated with CCDC90B, highlighting its potential importance in cellular metabolism and energy production (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). Despite these predictions, further experimental validation is necessary to fully understand the molecular functions and biological significance of CCDC90B.

## Structure


## Function
The CCDC90B gene encodes a protein that is primarily localized to the mitochondria within cells, as confirmed by studies using Mitotracker staining in 293T cells (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). This localization suggests a significant role in mitochondrial function. The protein is predicted to be involved in the positive regulation of mitochondrial calcium ion concentration and transmembrane transport, although these specific functions have not been experimentally confirmed (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). The molecular function of CCDC90B is also predicted to involve cation binding, but this has yet to be validated through experimental methods (Hwang2020Bioinformatic).

The study of CCDC90B is part of broader efforts to characterize proteins of unknown function, utilizing bioinformatics tools like I-TASSER/COFACTOR to predict gene ontology terms based on protein structure (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). These predictions are crucial for understanding the potential roles of CCDC90B in cellular processes, particularly in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, which are vital for cellular metabolism and overall cellular health. However, the exact molecular activities and organismal outcomes of CCDC90B's involvement in these processes remain to be fully elucidated (Hwang2020Bioinformatic).
