# INTS4

## Overview
INTS4 is a gene that encodes the protein integrator complex subunit 4, a crucial component of the Integrator complex involved in the 3'-end processing of uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs). The protein is characterized by its structural features, including N-terminal HEAT repeats and a C-terminal region rich in β-sheets, which facilitate its interaction with other subunits of the Integrator complex, particularly INTS9 and INTS11. This interaction is essential for the endonucleolytic activity required for UsnRNA processing, a critical step in the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and RNA splicing (Albrecht2018Integrator). Beyond its role in RNA processing, INTS4 is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of nuclear bodies such as Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, and it plays a role in transcriptional regulation by influencing RNA polymerase II activity (Albrecht2018Integrator; Beckedorff2020The). Clinically, INTS4 has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression correlates with poor survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Xu2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
INTS4 is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in the 3'-end processing of UsnRNAs. The protein is characterized by an array of N-terminal HEAT repeats, potentially numbering up to ten within the first 800 amino acids, and a C-terminal region rich in β-sheets (Albrecht2018Integrator). These structural features are essential for its interaction with the INTS9/11 heterodimer, forming a heterotrimeric complex that is critical for the Integrator's endonucleolytic activity (Albrecht2018Integrator).

The N-terminal HEAT repeats of INTS4 are similar to those found in Symplekin, suggesting a scaffold function that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Takata2012The). The C-terminal region, rich in β-sheets, is also crucial for binding, as deletions in this region disrupt interaction with INTS9/11 (Albrecht2018Integrator). Specific alanine mutations in the C-terminal region have been shown to affect the protein's function in UsnRNA processing, highlighting the importance of this region (Albrecht2018Integrator).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of INTS4 are not detailed in the available literature, its role as a scaffold and its interaction with other Integrator subunits are well-documented (Albrecht2018Integrator). The protein's structural integrity is vital for maintaining nuclear structures such as Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies (Albrecht2018Integrator).

## Function
INTS4, a subunit of the Integrator complex, plays a crucial role in the 3'-end processing of uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs) in human cells. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with INTS9 and INTS11, which is essential for the endonucleolytic activity required for UsnRNA processing. This processing is vital for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are key components in RNA splicing (Albrecht2018Integrator).

INTS4 is also involved in maintaining the structural integrity of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are nuclear structures important for snRNA biogenesis and histone mRNA production. Depletion of INTS4 leads to the disassembly of these structures, indicating its role in nuclear organization and function (Albrecht2018Integrator).

In addition to its role in RNA processing, INTS4 is part of a core catalytic module with INTS9 and INTS11 that is involved in transcriptional regulation. This module facilitates the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing, thereby influencing the expression of thousands of genes and playing a role in transcriptional elongation (Beckedorff2020The).

## Clinical Significance
INTS4 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that INTS4 is significantly overexpressed in HCC tumors compared to normal tissues, and this high expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Xu2024Comprehensive). Genetic alterations in INTS4, along with other integrator complex subunits, are found in over 61% of HCC patients, correlating with poorer overall and disease-free survival (Xu2024Comprehensive). The expression of INTS4 is also linked to a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment, affecting immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and macrophages, which may contribute to tumor progression (Xu2024Comprehensive).

In addition to its role in cancer, INTS4 is crucial for the structural integrity of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are important for RNA processing. Disruption of INTS4, along with INTS9 and INTS11, leads to the disassembly of these nuclear structures, indicating its essential role in maintaining cellular integrity (Albrecht2018Integrator). While specific diseases directly linked to INTS4 mutations are not detailed, its involvement in RNA processing suggests potential implications in various conditions where RNA processing is disrupted (Albrecht2018Integrator).

## Interactions
INTS4 is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in the 3'-end processing of UsnRNAs. INTS4 interacts specifically with the INTS9/INTS11 heterodimer to form a stable heterotrimeric complex. This interaction is essential for the function of the Integrator complex, as it mediates the endonucleolytic cleavage activity necessary for UsnRNA processing. The interaction between INTS4 and the INTS9/INTS11 heterodimer is dependent on both the N-terminal HEAT repeats and the C-terminal region of INTS4. The first two HEAT repeats are necessary for binding, while the first four are essential for interaction. The last 100 amino acids of the C-terminus are also required for this interaction (Albrecht2018Integrator).

INTS4 does not interact with INTS9 or INTS11 individually but binds to them as a complex. This interaction is conserved from Drosophila to humans and is crucial for the structural integrity of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are involved in snRNA biogenesis and histone mRNA production (Albrecht2018Integrator). The INTS4/9/11 complex is analogous to the 'core cleavage complex' formed by Symplekin, CPSF73, and CPSF100, which is involved in the processing of histone pre-mRNA (Albrecht2018Integrator).
