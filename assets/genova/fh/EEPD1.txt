# EEPD1

## Overview
EEPD1, or endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase family domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in DNA repair and genomic stability. The EEPD1 protein is categorized as a nuclease, specifically within the exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) family, and is characterized by its structure-specific nuclease activity. It plays a pivotal role in the homologous recombination repair pathway, facilitating the repair and restart of stalled replication forks and influencing DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice. The protein's unique structural features, including helix-hairpin-helix DNA binding domains and a DNase I-like domain, are complemented by lipid modification sites that anchor it to the plasma membrane, underscoring its functional versatility (Wu2015EEPD1; Nelson2017EEPD1). EEPD1's interactions with other proteins, such as Exo1 and BLM, further highlight its critical role in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer (Wu2015EEPD1; Liu2016EEPD1:).

## Structure
The EEPD1 protein is a 569 amino acid protein characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains two amino terminal helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA binding domains, which are related to the RuvA protein, and a carboxy terminal DNase I-like domain, placing it in the exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) family (Wu2015EEPD1; Nelson2017EEPD1). The protein also features a conserved D-D-N/D/E nuclease active site that overlaps with the HhH domain and the DNase I-like domain (Wu2015EEPD1). 

In silico analysis reveals that EEPD1 is unique among the EEP superfamily due to the presence of highly evolutionary-conserved myristoylation and palmitoylation lipid modification sites, which serve as membrane anchors (Nelson2017EEPD1). These lipid modifications are crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by the altered localization when the myristoylation site is abolished (Nelson2017EEPD1). 

Although a crystal structure for EEPD1 is not available, a predicted AlphaFold structure is mentioned, suggesting its complex tertiary structure (Nickoloff2022Metnase). The protein's role in DNA repair and replication stress responses is facilitated by its structure-specific nuclease activity, promoting homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks and stressed replication forks (Nickoloff2022Metnase).

## Function
The EEPD1 gene encodes a nuclease that plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability by facilitating the repair and restart of stalled replication forks in human cells. EEPD1 is involved in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, a conservative mechanism for repairing stressed replication forks. It initiates 5' end resection, a crucial step that allows for 3' single-strand invasion of a homologous template, thereby promoting fork restart (Wu2015EEPD1). EEPD1 is rapidly recruited to stalled replication forks, where it promotes 5' end resection, HR, and replication fork restart, preventing the accumulation of toxic HR intermediates and ensuring cell survival (Wu2015EEPD1).

EEPD1 also influences DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice by repressing classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) and enhancing HR, directing repair towards resection-dependent pathways. This function is significant as it prevents non-conservative repair and chromosomal fusions, which could result from unopposed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) (Wu2015EEPD1). EEPD1 is part of an end resection complex with Exo1 and BLM, necessary for the completion of end resection at damaged forks (Wu2015EEPD1). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus and is essential for proper cell cycle progression and clonogenicity (Wu2015EEPD1).

## Clinical Significance
EEPD1 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in DNA damage repair and genomic stability. Alterations in EEPD1 expression are associated with several types of cancer. In glioblastoma, EEPD1 is significantly upregulated, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and immune cell infiltration in the brain microenvironment (Yuan2023Multiomics). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high EEPD1 expression correlates with radioresistance, and its knockdown sensitizes cells to radiation, indicating its role in treatment resistance (Sun2021Radiation). EEPD1 is also linked to colon adenocarcinoma, where its high expression is associated with poorer overall survival and increased chemotherapy sensitivity (Liu2024Developing).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), EEPD1 contributes to maintaining genomic integrity through homologous recombination repair. Its expression levels are used to stratify patients based on their likelihood of achieving complete remission (Österroos2020Integrated). Additionally, EEPD1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism in macrophages, which may influence conditions related to cholesterol homeostasis, although specific diseases are not directly mentioned (Jangale2024Enhancing; Nelson2017EEPD1).

## Interactions
EEPD1 is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of DNA repair processes. It forms a constitutive and obligate complex with Exo1 and BLM, which is essential for the resection of DNA ends at stalled replication forks. This complex is stable even in the presence of DNase, indicating a strong interaction that is crucial for maintaining genome stability by preventing improper DNA cleavage (Wu2015EEPD1). EEPD1 does not co-immunoprecipitate with Dna2, suggesting it is not part of the RPA/Dna2/MRN end resection complex, but it does co-immunoprecipitate with Exo1, RPA32, and BLM, indicating these proteins are part of the same complex (Wu2015EEPD1).

EEPD1 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it interacts with replication protein A (RPA) and is implicated in ATR-dependent signaling pathways. It activates RPA foci and ATR phosphorylation, suggesting interactions with these proteins during the DNA damage response (Liu2016EEPD1:). These interactions highlight EEPD1's role in directing DNA repair towards homologous recombination and away from non-homologous end joining pathways, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Wu2015EEPD1).
