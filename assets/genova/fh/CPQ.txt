# CPQ

## Overview
The CPQ gene encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase Q, a member of the peptidase M28 family, which plays a significant role in protein catabolism by hydrolyzing circulating peptides into amino acids. This enzymatic function is crucial for the regulation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides, impacting various physiological processes, including hormone regulation and neurotransmitter function (Hou2023Genomewide). Carboxypeptidase Q is primarily active in the lysosome, where it contributes to the degradation of proteins and peptides. Beyond its metabolic roles, CPQ is involved in the immune response, particularly through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, influencing the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is vital for innate immunity (Hou2023Genomewide). The gene's expression is notably upregulated in immune cells, suggesting its involvement in the host response to infections such as COVID-19 (Hou2023Genomewide). Additionally, CPQ has been associated with cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Dey2018Whole).

## Function
The CPQ gene encodes carboxypeptidase Q, a protein that belongs to the peptidase M28 family and is involved in the hydrolysis of circulating peptides, including the cleavage of unsubstituted dipeptides into amino acids (Hou2023Genomewide). This enzymatic activity is crucial for protein catabolism and the regulation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides, influencing various physiological processes such as hormone regulation and neurotransmitter function. CPQ is active in the lysosome, where it participates in the degradation of proteins and peptides (Hou2023Genomewide).

In the context of immune response, CPQ is implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, potentially participating in the degradation of IκB, an inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for the innate immune response to viral infections, suggesting that CPQ may play a role in modulating immune responses (Hou2023Genomewide). The gene's expression is upregulated in immune cells such as monocyte clusters and alveolar macrophages, indicating its involvement in the host immune response to infections like COVID-19 (Hou2023Genomewide). CPQ's molecular function in human cells involves protein catabolism and localization, particularly in the context of immune response regulation (Hou2023Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The CPQ gene, encoding carboxypeptidase Q, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In humans, genome-wide association studies have linked the CPQ gene to cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, blood pressure regulation, and heart rate variability (Dey2018Whole). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CPQ gene have been associated with resistance to ascites syndrome in broilers, a condition related to pulmonary hypertension, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular health (Dey2018Whole).

In the context of infectious diseases, the CPQ gene has been identified as a potential risk factor influencing the severity of COVID-19, particularly with the Omicron variant. Studies suggest that CPQ may be involved in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune responses. Variants in the CPQ gene may lead to increased expression and excessive activation of this pathway, potentially resulting in heightened immune responses and tissue dysfunction during COVID-19 infections (Hou2023Genomewide). These findings indicate that CPQ could be a target for therapeutic interventions to modulate immune responses in COVID-19 and other diseases (Hou2023Genomewide).
