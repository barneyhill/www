# HOXC8

## Overview
The HOXC8 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which is known for encoding transcription factors that play pivotal roles in developmental processes. The gene encodes the homeobox C8 protein, a transcription factor characterized by a homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, thereby regulating the expression of target genes. This protein is integral to embryonic development, particularly in the patterning of the neural tube and somites, and is involved in processes such as chondrocyte maturation and endochondral ossification. HOXC8's interactions with other proteins, such as Smad1, further underscore its role in modulating gene expression pathways critical for cellular differentiation and development. Beyond its developmental functions, HOXC8 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Lei2005The; Yang2000Smad1; Shah2017HOXC8).

## Structure
The HOXC8 protein in the Liaoning cashmere goat is characterized by a typical homeodomain, which is 61 amino acids in length and located between positions 150 to 210 (Bai2017Molecular). The primary structure of the HOXC8 protein includes a homeodomain with a helix-turn-helix motif, which is a common feature in DNA-binding proteins (Roy2005Homology). The secondary structure of the HOXC8 protein comprises 64 α-helices (26.45%), 27 extended strands (11.16%), 13 β-turns (5.37%), and 138 random coils (57.02%) (Bai2017Molecular).

The tertiary structure, modeled using the Swiss-Model server, reveals three α-helices. Helices-1 and -2 are antiparallel and located near the N-terminus, while the longer helix-3 is near the C-terminus and interacts with DNA through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Bai2017Molecular). This helix is also responsible for the protein's membrane transducing ability (Kong2008The). The predicted three-dimensional structure of the HOXC8 protein was evaluated using ProSA-web, resulting in a z-score of -3.42, which is within the range of native protein structures (Bai2017Molecular).

The HOXC8 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and it can have splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions (Kong2008The).

## Function
The HOXC8 gene is a member of the homeobox family, which encodes transcription factors that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. In healthy human cells, HOXC8 is involved in the regulation of embryonic development and tissue differentiation. It is particularly important in maintaining tissue homeostasis by defining cell fate and lineage commitment, ensuring proper cell proliferation and differentiation during development (Shah2017HOXC8).

HOXC8 is expressed in the neural tube and somites during embryogenesis, where it is involved in anterior-posterior patterning, crucial for skeletal and neural development (Lei2005The; Adwan2011Expression). It influences chondrocyte maturation and proliferation, interacting with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways, which are important for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (Lei2005The). HOXC8 also plays a role in regulating endochondral ossification, a process essential for skeletal development, by controlling chondrocyte differentiation (Cormier2003Normal).

In addition to its developmental roles, HOXC8 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Ruthala2011Hoxc8).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HOXC8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative (TN) and HER2-enriched subtypes, HOXC8 is downregulated, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is associated with increased DNA methylation and miR196 expression, contributing to the maintenance of cancer stem cell properties and tumorigenicity (Shah2017HOXC8). 

In gastric cancer, HOXC8 is upregulated and correlates with shorter overall survival. Knockdown of HOXC8 in gastric cancer cells reduces proliferation and migration, indicating its role in promoting cancer progression (Gu2022The; Tsai2023HOXC8). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HOXC8 is also upregulated and associated with poor relapse-free survival and aggressive tumor phenotypes. It promotes cell proliferation and migration by upregulating TGFβ1 expression and contributes to chemoresistance (Liu2018HOXC8). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HOXC8 expression is inversely related to tumor progression and metastasis, with lower expression levels associated with higher-grade tumors (Adwan2011Expression). These findings highlight the complex role of HOXC8 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
HOXC8, a transcription factor from the homeobox gene family, engages in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in gene regulation. It specifically binds to DNA sequences, with a preference for the TAATG sequence, which is considered the true recognition element for HOXC8. This interaction involves specific residues such as Ile 195, Gln 198, and Asn 199, which are essential for DNA recognition and binding (Roy2005Homology).

HOXC8 also interacts with the Smad1 protein, a downstream effector of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. This interaction is significant in the context of osteoblast differentiation. The homeodomain of HOXC8 is sufficient for its interaction with Smad1, particularly with the MH1 domain of Smad1. This interaction inhibits HOXC8's DNA binding ability, suggesting a regulatory mechanism through protein-protein interaction rather than direct competition for DNA binding (Yang2000Smad1).

These interactions highlight the dual role of HOXC8 in both direct DNA binding and in modulating gene expression through interactions with other proteins, such as Smad1, which are critical for its function in developmental processes and cellular differentiation (Yang2000Smad1).
