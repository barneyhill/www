# KCNC3

## Overview
The KCNC3 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3, commonly referred to as the Kv3.3 channel. This protein is a transmembrane voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a critical role in the repolarization phase of action potentials in neurons, particularly those requiring rapid and precise firing, such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and neurons in the brainstem (Chang2007Distribution; Zhang2015Kv3.3). The Kv3.3 channel is characterized by its ability to activate at high membrane potentials, facilitating rapid repolarization and enabling high-frequency neuronal firing (Kaczmarek2017Kv3). Structurally, the channel is a tetramer composed of four identical subunits, each with six transmembrane segments, and it exists in multiple splice isoforms that influence its interactions and function (Pischalnikova2008The; Kaczmarek2017Kv3). Mutations in the KCNC3 gene are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor deficits and cerebellar degeneration, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (GallegoIradi2014KCNC3R420H; Zhang2015Kv3.3).

## Structure
The KCNC3 gene encodes the Kv3.3 potassium channel, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. This channel is characterized by six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with the pore region formed between segments S5 and S6, typical of the Kv channel structure (Pischalnikova2008The). The Kv3.3 channel is a tetramer, meaning it forms a functional channel by assembling four identical subunits (Pischalnikova2008The). 

Kv3.3 channels have three splice isoforms, Kv3.3a, Kv3.3b, and Kv3.3c, which differ in their cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domains. These domains are longer than those in other Kv3 family channels, suggesting unique interactions with cytoplasmic components (Kaczmarek2017Kv3). The cytoplasmic COOH terminus contains a proline-rich domain involved in actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex, which is crucial for the channel's normal gating and inactivation kinetics (Kaczmarek2017Kv3).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the channel's function. Phosphorylation at the NH2 terminus affects the inactivation process, which occurs through an 'N-type ball and chain' mechanism (Kaczmarek2017Kv3). The channel's interaction with the cell survival protein Hax-1 is also significant for maintaining the actin cytoskeleton and proper channel function (Kaczmarek2017Kv3).

## Function
The KCNC3 gene encodes the Kv3.3 potassium channel, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, which plays a crucial role in the repolarization phase of action potentials in neurons. Kv3.3 channels are characterized by their ability to activate at high membrane potentials, allowing for rapid repolarization and enabling neurons to fire at high frequencies. This is particularly important in neurons that require fast and precise firing, such as those in the cerebellum and brainstem (Chang2007Distribution; Zhang2015Kv3.3).

In the cerebellum, Kv3.3 channels are essential for the proper functioning of Purkinje cells, contributing to the generation of high-frequency spikelets during complex spikes, which are crucial for motor coordination and auditory processing (Duarri2015Functional; Kaczmarek2017Kv3). These channels also interact with the cell survival protein Hax-1, which helps maintain a stable actin cytoskeleton, influencing the inactivation kinetics of the channel and supporting cell survival and function (Kaczmarek2017Kv3).

Kv3.3 channels are expressed in various neuronal compartments, including somas, axons, and dendrites, and are involved in maintaining the electrophysiological properties of neurons, which is vital for synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Chang2007Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNC3 gene, which encodes the Kv3.3 potassium channel, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor deficits and cerebellar degeneration. Specific mutations, such as R420H, F448L, and R423H, lead to distinct clinical manifestations. The R420H mutation, located in the S4 transmembrane domain, results in adult-onset ataxia and non-functional channels that exert a dominant-negative effect, leading to cerebellar atrophy and gait disturbances (GallegoIradi2014KCNC3R420H; Zhang2015Kv3.3). The F448L mutation, found in the S5 transmembrane region, causes childhood-onset ataxia with cognitive delay and altered electrophysiological properties, such as a shift in voltage dependence and slower deactivation (Mock2010Functional; Zhang2015Kv3.3). The R423H mutation is linked to early-onset SCA13, characterized by severe symptoms including tremor, seizures, and cognitive impairment, due to its dominant-negative effect and altered channel behavior (Khare2017A; Zhang2015Kv3.3).

These mutations can affect not only cerebellar function but also other neuronal circuits, such as those involved in auditory processing, and contribute to the development of SCA13 by altering neuronal excitability and channel function (Issa2011Spinocerebellar; Zhang2015Kv3.3).

## Interactions
The KCNC3 protein, also known as Kv3.3, is a voltage-gated potassium channel that participates in various protein interactions, influencing its function and localization. The KCNC3 R423H mutation has been shown to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. In Drosophila, overexpression of dEgfr can rescue phenotypes caused by the KCNC3 R423H mutation, suggesting a link between the mutant channel and EGFR signaling. In mammalian cells, this mutation leads to aberrant trafficking of EGFR, causing it to be sequestered in intracellular vesicles rather than being properly transported to the plasma membrane. This effect is dependent on the molar ratio of KCNC3 R423H to EGFR, with normal trafficking restored at lower ratios (Khare2017A).

The KCNC3 R420H mutation also affects protein interactions, particularly with Golgi-specific proteins. This mutation results in the retention of the KCNC3 protein in the Golgi apparatus, affecting cellular morphology and trafficking. Co-expression of KCNC3 wild-type and KCNC3 R420H leads to the co-retention of both proteins in the Golgi, which may explain the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (GallegoIradi2014KCNC3R420H). These interactions highlight the role of KCNC3 in cellular processes and its impact on disease phenotypes.
