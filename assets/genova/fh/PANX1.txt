# PANX1

## Overview
The PANX1 gene encodes the pannexin 1 protein, a transmembrane channel that plays a pivotal role in cellular communication by facilitating the release of ATP, a critical signaling molecule. Pannexin 1 is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and muscle cells, and is involved in numerous physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity, pain perception, and muscle activity (Bhat2021Human; Sandilos2012Physiological). Structurally, pannexin 1 forms a heptameric assembly, with each protomer comprising four transmembrane helices and distinct extracellular and intracellular loops, which are essential for its function as a large-pore channel (Michalski2020The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as actin microfilaments and β-catenin, underscore its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling pathways (Sayedyahossein2021Pannexin; BhallaGehi2010Pannexin1). Clinically, alterations in PANX1 expression and function are linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Laird2021Pannexin; SanchezArias2021Purinergic).

## Structure
The human pannexin 1 (PANX1) channel is a large-pore ATP release channel with a heptameric assembly, contrary to earlier reports suggesting a hexameric structure (Qu2020CryoEM; Michalski2020The). Each PANX1 protomer consists of four transmembrane helices, two extracellular loops, two intracellular loops, and an N-terminal loop (Michalski2020The). The transmembrane helices are arranged in a bundle, similar to other large-pore channels like connexins and innexins (Michalski2020The). The extracellular loops, ECL1 and ECL2, are joined by conserved disulfide bonds and contain structural features such as an alpha-helix that forms an extracellular constriction (Michalski2020The).

The heptameric structure is stabilized by inter-subunit interactions at key locations, including the extracellular loops and transmembrane interfaces (Michalski2020The). The extracellular domain features a constriction site formed by residues such as Trp74 and Arg75, which are crucial for ion selection and channel function (Michalski2020The). The intracellular domains are unique, with the N-terminus forming a constriction in the permeation pathway (Michalski2020The).

Post-translational modifications, such as caspase-mediated cleavage, play a role in channel activation, particularly at the C-terminal tail (Mou2020Structural). The PANX1 channel's structure and function are influenced by these modifications, contributing to its role in physiological processes like pyroptosis (Zhang2021Structure).

## Function
Pannexin 1 (PANX1) is a channel protein that plays a crucial role in ATP release, a key signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes. PANX1 channels are ubiquitously expressed across many cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, taste bud cells, T-cells, erythrocytes, airway epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and muscle cells (Sandilos2012Physiological). These channels facilitate ATP-mediated signaling, which is significant for cell communication, particularly in astrocytes where it aids in intracellular calcium propagation (WhyteFagundes2018Mechanisms).

PANX1 channels are involved in several cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, pain perception, precursor cell development, and muscle activity (Bhat2021Human). They also play a role in the electrophysiological responsiveness of retinal ganglion cells, contributing to visual function (Bhat2021Human). In the cochlea, PANX1 is essential for hearing, and its deficiency can lead to hearing loss through activation of apoptotic pathways (Bhat2021Human).

The channels are activated by various stimuli, including purinergic receptor interactions, intracellular calcium levels, mechanical stimulation, and post-translational modifications (WhyteFagundes2018Mechanisms). PANX1 is also involved in apoptosis by forming calcium-permeable pores that contribute to cell death processes (Bhat2021Human). These functions highlight the importance of PANX1 in maintaining cellular integrity and responding to physiological and stress signals in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PANX1 gene are linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. In cancer, high levels of PANX1 expression are associated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer, as it may provide tumors with an advantage by influencing immune cell infiltration and ATP release, which regulates T cell activation (Laird2021Pannexin). PANX1 also interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in melanoma, affecting cell growth and metastasis. Inhibiting PANX1 can reduce tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting potential therapeutic applications (Sayedyahossein2021Pannexin).

In terms of genetic mutations, the R217H variant of PANX1 is associated with multisystem dysfunction, including intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss, and primary ovarian failure. This variant results in reduced channel function, affecting ATP release and cellular communication (Shao2016A). Other variants, such as p.Asn326del and p.Ser137Leu, have been linked to female infertility by causing oocyte death through altered channel activity and ATP release (Zhou2024A).

PANX1 is also implicated in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where it contributes to neuroinflammation and synaptic impairments. Blocking PANX1 channels has shown potential in reversing some disease-related pathologies (SanchezArias2021Purinergic).

## Interactions
Pannexin 1 (PANX1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. PANX1 interacts with actin microfilaments, which is crucial for its cell surface localization and mobility. This interaction is direct, with PANX1 binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) through its carboxyl-terminal tail, highlighting its role in cytoskeletal dynamics (BhallaGehi2010Pannexin1).

In melanoma cells, PANX1 binds to β-catenin, a key transcription factor in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction involves the C-terminal region of PANX1 and the N-terminal portion of β-catenin, affecting β-catenin's stability and transcriptional activity. PANX1's interaction with β-catenin is crucial for melanoma cell growth and metabolism, influencing cellular processes like proliferation and migration (Sayedyahossein2021Pannexin).

PANX1 also interacts with calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner, suggesting a role in modulating calcium signaling (Sayedyahossein2021Pannexin). In vascular smooth muscle cells, PANX1 interacts with caveolin-1 (Cav1), which is important for adrenergic vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation. This interaction is stimulated by adrenergic agonists and involves the formation of plasma membrane complexes (DeLalio2018Interaction).
