# XKR8

## Overview
XKR8 is a gene that encodes the XK-related protein 8, a member of the XK family, which functions as a phospholipid scramblase. This protein is characterized by its eight transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic helix, forming a cuboid-like structure essential for its role in cellular processes (Sakuragi2021An; Sakuragi2021The). The XKR8 protein is crucial for the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on the cell surface during apoptosis, serving as an "eat me" signal for macrophages to clear apoptotic cells (Suzuki2014Exposure; Kawano2018Lupuslike). This function is vital for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing the release of harmful intracellular materials. XKR8 forms a complex with Basigin (BSG) or Neuroplastin (NPTN), which is necessary for its scramblase activity and proper localization to the plasma membrane (Suzuki2016Xkr8). The gene's dysfunction has been linked to various diseases, including hereditary auditory neuropathy and autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (Kawano2018Lupuslike; Chen2023A).

## Structure
The XKR8 protein is a member of the XK family and functions as a phospholipid scramblase. It is composed of eight transmembrane helices and an additional cytoplasmic helix, forming a cuboid-like structure stabilized by salt bridges between hydrophilic residues within the transmembrane segments (Sakuragi2021An; Sakuragi2021The). The protein's tertiary structure includes a hydrophobic cleft that binds phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), which is crucial for its scrambling activity (Sakuragi2021The). This cleft is surrounded by specific helices and amino acids that facilitate phospholipid binding, with a tryptophan residue (W45) acting as a gatekeeper to regulate phospholipid entry (Sakuragi2021An).

The XKR8 protein forms a heterodimer with Basigin (BSG) or Neuroplastin (NPTN), and this interaction is essential for its function in exposing phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) during apoptosis (Sakuragi2021An; Suzuki2016Xkr8). The quaternary structure of the XKR8-BSG complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, with specific residues playing a critical role in maintaining the complex's stability and function (Sakuragi2021The). The protein is activated by caspase cleavage or phosphorylation, which induces conformational changes necessary for its scramblase activity (Sakuragi2021An; Suzuki2016Xkr8).

## Function
The XKR8 gene encodes a protein that functions as a phospholipid scramblase, crucial for the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on the cell surface during apoptosis. This exposure acts as an "eat me" signal for macrophages, facilitating the clearance of apoptotic cells through efferocytosis (Suzuki2014Exposure; Kawano2018Lupuslike). In healthy cells, XKR8 is involved in maintaining the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane, a process essential for cellular homeostasis (Sakuragi2021The). The protein forms a complex with basigin (BSG) or neuroplastin (NPTN), which is necessary for its scramblase activity (Suzuki2016Xkr8).

XKR8 is activated by caspase cleavage during apoptosis, which disrupts the phospholipid asymmetry and allows PtdSer to be exposed on the cell surface (Suzuki2016Xkr8; Suzuki2014Exposure). This process is crucial for preventing the release of potentially harmful intracellular materials and maintaining immune homeostasis (Kawano2018Lupuslike). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Suzuki2014Exposure). XKR8's activity is essential for the rapid exposure of PtdSer, which is necessary for proper cellular functions such as apoptosis and blood coagulation (Sakuragi2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XKR8 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A heterozygous nonsense mutation in XKR8, specifically c.710G > A (p.W237X), has been associated with hereditary auditory neuropathy (AN). This mutation introduces a premature stop codon, potentially leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or a truncated protein, which impairs the protein's localization to the cell membrane and may exert a dominant-negative effect. In affected individuals, this results in delayed onset of hearing loss, resembling AN, with symptoms worsening over time (Chen2023A).

XKR8 deficiency is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. In Xkr8-deficient mice, the impaired exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) leads to inefficient clearance of apoptotic cells, resulting in the accumulation of these cells and the development of lupus-like autoimmune symptoms. This includes splenomegaly, high levels of autoantibodies, and glomerulonephritis, suggesting a link between XKR8 dysfunction and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Kawano2018Lupuslike).

Alterations in XKR8 interactions, particularly with proteins like Basigin (BSG) and Neuroplastin (NPTN), are crucial for its function. Disruptions in these interactions can affect phospholipid scrambling, potentially contributing to diseases where apoptosis is dysregulated (Suzuki2016Xkr8).

## Interactions
XKR8 interacts with Basigin (BSG) or Neuroplastin (NPTN) to form a complex essential for its function as a phospholipid scramblase. This interaction is crucial for the localization of XKR8 to the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the exposure of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis (Suzuki2016Xkr8). The XKR8-BSG complex has a unique cuboid-like structure stabilized by salt bridges between hydrophilic residues in transmembrane helices, which are critical for its scramblase activity (Sakuragi2021The).

Caspase cleavage of XKR8 is necessary for its activation, leading to the formation of a higher-order complex, likely a heterotetramer, with BSG or NPTN. This complex formation is essential for phospholipid scrambling and is influenced by specific residues in the transmembrane regions of BSG and XKR8 (Suzuki2016Xkr8). The interaction between E230 of BSG and R284 of XKR8 is particularly important for the chaperone activity of BSG, facilitating the proper localization of XKR8 (Sakuragi2021The).

Mutations in key residues of XKR8, such as W45A, can enhance its phospholipid scrambling activity, indicating that these interactions are finely regulated and critical for its function (Sakuragi2021The).
