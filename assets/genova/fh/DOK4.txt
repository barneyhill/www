# DOK4

## Overview
DOK4, or docking protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the DOK family of adaptor proteins, which are integral to intracellular signal transduction processes. The protein product of DOK4 is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate its interaction with the plasma membrane and receptor proteins, thereby playing a pivotal role in various signaling pathways (Grimm2001Novel; Guittard2018Evolutionary). DOK4 is particularly involved in neuronal differentiation and insulin signaling, acting as a substrate for receptor tyrosine kinases such as the RET receptor, and is crucial for processes like neurite outgrowth and sustained activation of the ERK pathway (Uchida2006Dok4). The protein is expressed in diverse tissues, including the nervous system and immune cells, and its phosphorylation state is essential for its function in pathways like the GDNF/RET signaling pathway (Grimm2001Novel; Uchida2006Dok4). DOK4's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Cai2003Two; Oshi2020A).

## Structure
DOK4 is a member of the DOK family of adaptor proteins, characterized by specific structural domains that facilitate its role in signal transduction. The protein contains an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which are essential for its interaction with the plasma membrane and receptor proteins (Grimm2001Novel; Guittard2018Evolutionary). These domains enable DOK4 to participate in various signaling pathways by mediating interactions with other proteins.

The carboxy-terminal region of DOK4 includes tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated, allowing the recruitment of proteins with Src-homology-2 (SH2) domains (Guittard2018Evolutionary). This phosphorylation is crucial for its function in pathways such as the GDNF/RET signaling pathway, where it plays a role in neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation (Uchida2006Dok4).

DOK4 is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system and immune cells, and is involved in both neuronal differentiation and immune cell signaling (Grimm2001Novel; Guittard2018Evolutionary). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for its diverse functional roles. However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of DOK4 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DOK4 (docking protein 4) is a member of the p62dok family of adaptor proteins, which play a crucial role in intracellular signal transduction. In healthy human cells, DOK4 is involved in several signaling pathways, particularly those related to neuronal differentiation and insulin signaling. It acts as a substrate for receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the RET receptor, and is essential for neurite outgrowth, a process indicative of neuronal differentiation. DOK4 enhances the activation of the Rap1 and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways, particularly the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway, which is crucial for sustained ERK activation and neurite extension (Uchida2006Dok4).

DOK4 is also implicated in insulin signaling, where it is rapidly phosphorylated in response to insulin and interacts with SH2 domain proteins like Src and Fyn. This interaction suggests a role in linking insulin signaling to the MAPK cascade, potentially influencing cellular processes such as growth and metabolism (Cai2003Two). DOK4 is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and neurite tips, where it modulates downstream signaling pathways, influencing cellular responses and organismal development (Uchida2006Dok4).

## Clinical Significance
DOK4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In breast cancer, DOK4 is a component of a 4-gene score used to predict survival, distant metastasis, and response to neoadjuvant therapy. High expression levels of DOK4, along with other genes in the score, are associated with worse survival outcomes, particularly in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (Oshi2020A). DOK4 is also involved in the regulation of the MAPK pathway and is phosphorylated by the RET tyrosine kinase, which is over-expressed in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This overexpression is linked to shorter metastasis-free survival and overall survival (Oshi2020A).

In acute myeloid leukemia, DOK4 has been identified as a biomarker for poor prognostic outcomes (Oshi2020A). Its expression levels have been reported to vary in non-small cell lung cancer, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism of regulation (Oshi2020A). Additionally, DOK4 expression is increased by the knockdown of miR-182 and miR-183 in ductal carcinoma in situ, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Oshi2020A). In the context of insulin signaling, DOK4 is involved in metabolic homeostasis, potentially influencing conditions like type 2 diabetes (Cai2003Two).

## Interactions
DOK4 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role as an adaptor in signaling pathways. It is phosphorylated in response to insulin and IGF-1, and this phosphorylation is enhanced by insulin, similar to IRS-1. DOK4 interacts with SH2 domains from proteins such as Src, Fyn, Crk, and the SH2/SH3/SH2 region of RasGAP, but not with Grb2, Nck, or PI 3-kinase p85. These interactions are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that DOK4 associates with Src, Fyn, CrkII, and RasGAP in an insulin-dependent manner (Cai2003Two).

DOK4 also plays a role in the GDNF/RET signaling pathway, where it interacts with the RET receptor. This interaction is crucial for RET-mediated neurite outgrowth, with DOK4 being phosphorylated following RET activation. The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on DOK4 is necessary for its activity and the induction of neurite outgrowth (Uchida2006Dok4). DOK4 is a substrate for the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase and mediates neuronal differentiation by enhancing c-Ret-dependent activation of the MAP kinase pathway (Grimm2001Novel).
