# SSTR2

## Overview
The SSTR2 gene encodes the somatostatin receptor 2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, primarily through its role in inhibiting hormone secretion and cell proliferation. SSTR2 achieves these effects by coupling with Gi/o proteins, leading to downstream signaling events that modulate intracellular cAMP levels and calcium concentrations. The receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system and pancreatic islets, where it influences neurotransmission and insulin secretion, respectively. SSTR2's involvement in critical signaling pathways, such as PI3K-mTOR and MAPK, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in pathological conditions, including cancer (Braun2014The; Günther2018International; Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin).

## Structure
The somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven-transmembrane alpha helices, which are typical of class A GPCRs (Zhao2022Structural; Gervasoni2023Molecular). The primary structure of SSTR2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, while its secondary structure includes these alpha helices arranged in a transmembrane domain (Zhao2022Structural). The tertiary structure involves the spatial arrangement of these helices, contributing to the receptor's functional conformation (Chen2022Structures).

SSTR2 can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which may influence its signaling capabilities (Robertson2022Plasticity). The receptor undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its function and signaling pathways (Zhao2022Structural). SSTR2 also has splice variant isoforms, including SSTR2a and SSTR2b, which may have distinct functional properties (Robertson2022Plasticity).

The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of SSTR2 plays a crucial role in ligand binding, forming short antiparallel β-strands stabilized by conserved disulfide bonds (Chen2022Structures; Zhao2022Structural). Specific residues within the ligand-binding pocket, such as Q102, D122, and F294, are important for ligand selectivity and receptor activation (Zhao2022Structural; Bo2022Structural).

## Function
Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various cellular and physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in inhibiting hormone secretion and cell proliferation. SSTR2 achieves this by coupling with Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, which reduces cAMP accumulation and decreases intracellular calcium concentrations, leading to reduced hormone secretion (Günther2018International; Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin). 

SSTR2 is also involved in the regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion in pancreatic islets, where it is the most strongly expressed receptor. It inhibits insulin secretion and modulates membrane potential and calcium influx in β-cells (Braun2014The). In the central nervous system, SSTR2 modulates neurotransmission and neuronal activity, contributing to processes such as antinociception and stress response regulation (Günther2018International).

At the molecular level, SSTR2 activation leads to the inhibition of pathways like PI3K-mTOR and MAPK, resulting in cell cycle arrest and decreased cell proliferation. This is mediated through the activation of tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, which dephosphorylate key signaling molecules (Günther2018International; Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin). SSTR2's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining hormonal balance and regulating secretory functions in healthy human cells (Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) are associated with various cancers, including prostate, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. In prostate cancer, the loss of SSTR2 expression is linked to an aggressive cancer phenotype, characterized by high tumor cell proliferation and early metastatic and biochemical relapse. This downregulation is associated with unfavorable tumor phenotypes and early PSA relapse, indicating a poor prognosis for patients (Hennigs2014Loss). The loss of SSTR2 is also observed in pancreatic and colorectal cancers, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Hennigs2014Loss).

In lung cancer, particularly small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SSTR2 expression is linked to poor prognosis. Somatostatin analogues targeting SSTR2 have shown potential in suppressing tumor progression, although clinical trials with SSTR2 agonists have not been encouraging, possibly due to the lack of certain signaling pathways (Kumar2023Somatostatin).

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, play a significant role in regulating SSTR2 expression. These modifications can lead to differential expression of SSTR2 in various cancers, impacting its role in disease progression and offering potential therapeutic targets (Klomp2020Epigenetic; Torrisani2008Identification).

## Interactions
Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) engages in various interactions with proteins that influence its signaling and function. SSTR2 interacts with the scaffolding protein Filamin A (FLNA), which stabilizes and signals SSTR2 at the plasma membrane, protecting it from degradation and facilitating its recycling during long-term agonist treatment (Günther2018International). SSTR2 also interacts with Shank proteins, which link receptor complexes to the actin-based cytoskeleton, and with PDZ domain-containing proteins like PDZ-K1, suggesting a role in coupling somatostatin receptor subtypes to phospholipase C (PLC) through ternary complex formation (Günther2018International).

SSTR2 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) that, upon phosphorylation, recruit SHP-2, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation (Günther2018International). The receptor also interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, with competitive binding regulated by the phosphorylation state of specific tyrosine residues (Günther2018International). SSTR2 forms constitutive homodimers and can heterodimerize with SSTR3, affecting the activity of SSTR3 (Günther2018International). These interactions are crucial for the receptor's role in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in various cellular contexts.
