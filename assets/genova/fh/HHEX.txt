# HHEX

## Overview
The HHEX gene, also known as hematopoietically expressed homeobox, encodes a transcription factor that is pivotal in various developmental and physiological processes. This homeobox protein is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, functioning as both a transcriptional activator and repressor depending on the cellular context. HHEX is integral to embryogenesis, particularly in the development of the foregut endoderm, and plays a crucial role in the differentiation and function of pancreatic delta cells, as well as in haematopoiesis. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its DNA binding capacity. HHEX is also involved in significant protein-protein interactions, including those with the Groucho/TLE family and the YAP-TEAD4 complex, impacting processes like tumorigenesis and immune regulation. Clinically, alterations in HHEX expression or function are associated with various malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer, as well as metabolic disorders like Type 2 Diabetes (Guo2022CK2induced; Zhang2014The; Jackson2023The).

## Structure
The HHEX protein is a homeobox transcription factor with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is evolutionarily conserved across species such as fish, amphibians, birds, mice, and humans (Jackson2023The). The secondary structure includes elements like alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of homeobox proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of HHEX features a homeodomain, which is crucial for DNA binding. This domain allows HHEX to function as a transcriptional regulator, either repressing or activating gene expression depending on the context and interactions with cofactors (Jackson2023The). The activation domain is located at the carboxy-terminus, while the N-terminus may inhibit DNA binding by the homeodomain and facilitate oligomer formation within the nucleus (Jackson2023The).

In terms of quaternary structure, HHEX can form stable oligomers, such as octamers, which bind with high affinity to DNA, promoting transcriptional repression (Jackson2023The). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at residues S163 and S177, which inhibits DNA binding, a process reversible by dephosphorylation (Jackson2023The). The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The HHEX gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various developmental and physiological processes in humans. It is involved in embryogenesis, particularly in the development of the foregut endoderm, which leads to the formation of endocrine organs such as the pancreas, liver, and bile duct (Jackson2023The). HHEX functions as both a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on the context and cofactor interactions, and is involved in cytokine and growth factor signaling (Jackson2023The).

In the pancreas, HHEX is expressed in somatostatin-secreting delta cells and is essential for maintaining their differentiation and function. Its deficiency leads to decreased somatostatin levels, disrupting the paracrine inhibition of insulin release from beta cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Zhang2014The; Jackson2023The). HHEX also plays a role in haematopoiesis, including the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells and the development of B and T cells (Jackson2023The).

HHEX is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate the transcription of target genes, influencing processes like angiogenesis and organogenesis (Jackson2023The). Its function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affects its DNA binding ability (Jackson2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The HHEX gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In haematological malignancies, HHEX plays a significant role, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Overexpression of HHEX can induce myeloid leukemia and is involved in chromosomal translocations such as NUP98/HHEX, which are associated with AML. In T-ALL, HHEX is part of a transcriptional program necessary for disease development and contributes to the radio-resistance of leukemic stem cells (Jackson2023The).

In solid tumors, HHEX is involved in the development of several cancers, including breast, prostate, and liver cancers. In breast cancer, low HHEX expression is linked to poor prognosis, while its overexpression can impair tumor growth. HHEX promoter methylation is higher in breast cancer patients and is associated with nodal metastasis and shorter overall survival (Zhang2020Clinicopathological; Jackson2023The). In prostate cancer, HHEX's DNA binding is inhibited by CK2 phosphorylation, promoting cancer cell proliferation (Jackson2023The).

HHEX is also associated with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), where its expression in pancreatic delta cells affects insulin release, potentially contributing to the disease (Zhang2014The). In Alzheimer's Disease, certain HHEX SNPs have been identified as risk factors, particularly in specific populations (Jackson2023The).

## Interactions
HHEX (hematopoietically expressed homeobox) is a transcription factor that engages in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. HHEX interacts with the Groucho/TLE family of co-repressor proteins, such as TLE1 and TLE3, through its N-terminal Eh-1 motif. This interaction is crucial for transcriptional repression, as it facilitates the nuclear retention of TLE proteins, which do not bind DNA directly but are recruited by DNA-binding proteins (Laidlaw2020The; Desjobert2008The).

In colorectal cancer, HHEX interacts with the YAP-TEAD4 complex, enhancing its transcriptional activity and promoting tumorigenesis. The N-terminal proline-rich domain of HHEX is required for its interaction with YAP, while the homeodomain is crucial for binding TEAD4. This interaction is modulated by Casein Kinase II (CK2), which phosphorylates HHEX, enhancing its interaction with TEAD4 (Guo2022CK2induced).

HHEX also interacts with Foxp3 in regulatory T cells, inhibiting Foxp3 expression and function. This interaction involves the NT2 domain of HHEX, which binds to the Foxp3 promoter, repressing the activity of Treg signature genes (Jang2019Homeobox).
