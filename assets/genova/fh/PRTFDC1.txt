# PRTFDC1

## Overview
PRTFDC1 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1, which is involved in nucleotide metabolism, particularly within the purine salvage pathway. This pathway is essential for recycling purines to synthesize nucleotides, crucial for DNA and RNA synthesis. Although PRTFDC1 is a paralog of the HPRT1 gene, it has lost the enzymatic activity characteristic of HPRT1, suggesting a potential evolution towards a novel function (Keebaugh2007Gene). The protein contains a phosphoribosyl transferase domain, yet its precise role in human cells remains to be fully understood (Keebaugh2007Gene). Predominantly expressed in the brain, PRTFDC1 may play a role in neurological functions, possibly interacting with proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Nievergelt2015Genomic; Mukilan2018MiR132). The gene's conservation across species underscores its potential functional significance, although its specific activities in cellular and developmental processes are still under investigation (Nicklas2005Pseudogenes).

## Function
PRTFDC1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in nucleotide metabolism, specifically within the purine salvage pathway. This pathway is crucial for recycling purines to synthesize nucleotides, which are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis. Although PRTFDC1 is a paralog of the HPRT1 gene, it has lost the ancestral enzymatic activity associated with HPRT1, suggesting it may have evolved a new function (Keebaugh2007Gene). The protein encoded by PRTFDC1 contains a phosphoribosyl transferase domain, but its exact role in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Keebaugh2007Gene).

PRTFDC1 is expressed predominantly in the brain, indicating a potential role in neurological functions (Nievergelt2015Genomic). It has been suggested that PRTFDC1 may interact with other proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory formation, although the specific molecular mechanisms are not yet clear (Mukilan2018MiR132). The gene is conserved across several species, which implies a functional significance, but its precise activities in cellular processes and organismal development are still under investigation (Nicklas2005Pseudogenes).

## Clinical Significance
The PRTFDC1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its potential role in genetic and expression alterations. In the context of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a genome-wide association study identified PRTFDC1 as a potential gene associated with the disorder. The study found a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the PRTFDC1 gene that showed consistent effects across multiple ancestry groups, suggesting its relevance in PTSD. However, the clinical significance of this association requires further investigation to understand the gene's role in PTSD fully (Nievergelt2015Genomic).

In the realm of cancer, PRTFDC1 expression has been linked to prognosis in HER2+ breast cancer patients. High expression levels of PRTFDC1 are associated with a favorable prognosis for disease-free survival at five years, indicating its potential as a predictive marker for chemotherapy resistance and survival outcomes (BarrónGallardo2022A).

Additionally, PRTFDC1 has been studied as a genetic modifier in HPRT-deficient mice, a model for Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND). The presence of the PRTFDC1 transgene in these mice increased aggression and sensitivity to amphetamine-induced behaviors, suggesting that PRTFDC1 may influence the severity of neurological symptoms in LND (Keebaugh2011PRTFDC1).
