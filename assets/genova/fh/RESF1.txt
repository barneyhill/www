# RESF1

## Overview
The RESF1 gene encodes the protein retroelement silencing factor 1, which plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by silencing retrotransposons, thereby preventing genomic instability and disruptions in gene expression. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus and is associated with chromatin and nucleoplasm, where it binds to DNA sequences with high GC content and G4 quadruplexes, structures involved in telomere maintenance and genome stability (Majocha2024Resf1). RESF1 is characterized by a largely unstructured form, with a single high-confidence alpha helix and a domain of unknown function, facilitating its role through post-translational modifications and transient interactions (Majocha2024Resf1). The protein interacts with key pluripotency transcription factors and histone methyltransferases, indicating its involvement in embryonic stem cell self-renewal and chromatin binding (Vojtek2021Loss). Clinically, RESF1 functions as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer, and is associated with early-onset coronary artery disease, although its precise mechanisms in disease progression remain to be fully elucidated (Majocha2024Resf1).

## Structure
The RESF1 protein is characterized by a large size, consisting of 1521 amino acids, and is encoded primarily by a single exon (Majocha2024Resf1). The primary amino acid sequence of RESF1 is highly variable across species, with only 44% identity between mouse and human, which is significantly lower than the average of ~85% for other proteins (Majocha2024Resf1). Despite this variability, the gene structure is conserved across species (Majocha2024Resf1).

Structurally, RESF1 is largely unstructured, with predictions indicating that the majority of the protein is disordered. However, a single high-confidence alpha helix is identified in the N-terminal third of the protein (Majocha2024Resf1). The protein contains a single large domain of unknown function, and its disordered regions are thought to facilitate function through post-translational modifications and transient protein-protein interactions (Majocha2024Resf1).

RESF1 is associated with DNA sequences exhibiting high GC content and DNA G4 quadruplexes, suggesting a role in processes such as telomere maintenance and genome stability (Majocha2024Resf1). Despite its associations, no specific quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms have been detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The RESF1 gene, also known as retroelement silencing factor 1, plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by silencing retrotransposons, which are genetic elements capable of moving within the genome. This silencing is crucial for preventing genomic instability and potential disruptions in gene expression. RESF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins and molecular pathways to suppress retroelement transcription and integration (Majocha2024Resf1).

In healthy human cells, RESF1 is associated with chromatin and nucleoplasm, and it binds to DNA sequences with high GC content, particularly those capable of forming G4 quadruplexes. These structures are involved in various cellular processes, including telomere maintenance and genome stability (Majocha2024Resf1). RESF1 is linked to highly expressed 7S RNAs, exons of protein-coding genes, and ribosomal RNA repeats, suggesting a role in transcriptional processes (Majocha2024Resf1).

Although RESF1 is associated with ribosomal RNA repeats and noncoding RNAs, its depletion does not significantly affect global protein translation or ribosomal biogenesis, indicating that its interactions and effects may be transient or context-dependent (Majocha2024Resf1). The specific role of RESF1 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as its interactions and effects may vary depending on the cellular context (Majocha2024Resf1).

## Clinical Significance
The RESF1 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, RESF1 functions as a tumor suppressor, with its expression levels influencing metastatic potential and survival outcomes. Lower expression of RESF1 is associated with increased metastasis and poorer survival in both mouse models and human patients, suggesting its role in tumor suppression (Majocha2024Resf1). However, the gene's role is complex, as some studies indicate that decreased RESF1 expression can lead to reduced metastatic capacity in certain cell line experiments, highlighting its dual role in cancer progression (Majocha2024Resf1).

RESF1 is also associated with early-onset coronary artery disease, particularly in Japanese patients, although the mechanistic overlap with its role in cancer remains unclear (Majocha2024Resf1). The gene's interactions with DNA G4 quadruplexes, which are linked to various cellular processes and cancer-related phenomena, suggest that its tumor suppressor functions may be related to these interactions (Majocha2024Resf1). Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms by which RESF1 influences disease progression require further investigation.

## Interactions
RESF1 interacts with several key proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and germline specification. It physically interacts with pluripotency transcription factors such as NANOG and OCT4, suggesting its involvement in maintaining ESC pluripotency (Vojtek2021Loss). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the interaction between RESF1 and NANOG, indicating a direct physical association (Vojtek2021Loss).

RESF1 also interacts with the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, which is involved in chromatin binding and the silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). The deletion of RESF1 results in decreased SETDB1 binding and reduced levels of trimethylated histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9me3), suggesting that RESF1 supports the chromatin binding of SETDB1 (Vojtek2021Loss).

In the context of cancer, RESF1 is associated with DNA G4 quadruplexes, complex secondary structures formed by guanine tetrads. It is significantly associated with sites in the human genome, particularly those linked to ribosomal RNA repeats and noncoding RNAs, indicating a potential role in transcriptional regulation (Majocha2024Resf1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RESF1 in both stem cell biology and cancer.
