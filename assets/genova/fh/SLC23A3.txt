# SLC23A3

## Overview
SLC23A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 23 member 3, which is part of the solute carrier family involved in the transport of vitamin C. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, playing a crucial role in the cellular uptake and distribution of vitamin C, an essential nutrient with antioxidant properties. The gene's expression and function are significant in maintaining vitamin C homeostasis, which is vital for various physiological processes, including collagen synthesis and immune function. While SLC23A3 has been linked to plasma vitamin C levels, its broader implications in human health and disease, particularly in metabolic and kidney-related conditions, are still under investigation (Zheng2020Plasma; DomingoGallego2021Clinical; Yin2022Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC23A3 gene, which encodes a member of the solute carrier family involved in vitamin C transport, is still being explored. Mutations in SLC23A3 have been identified in patients with unspecified tubulopathy, suggesting a potential role in kidney-related conditions (DomingoGallego2021Clinical). However, the specific clinical implications of these mutations remain unclear.

Genome-wide association studies have linked SLC23A3 to plasma vitamin C levels, but no significant association with type 2 diabetes or glycemic traits has been found, indicating that while SLC23A3 influences vitamin C transport, it does not have a direct clinical impact on these conditions (Zheng2020Plasma). Additionally, SLC23A3 has been associated with a broad range of metabolites, suggesting it may affect various metabolic processes, though specific diseases linked to these associations have not been detailed (Yin2022Genomewide).

Overall, while SLC23A3 is implicated in certain metabolic and kidney conditions, its precise role in disease remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
