# NPIPB12

## Overview
NPIPB12 is a gene that encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B12, a protein that is part of the nuclear pore complex interacting protein (NPIP) family. This family is integral to the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, a critical process for cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation. The NPIPB12 protein is involved in the selective exchange of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm, functioning as a key component of the nuclear pore complex. The NPIP family, including NPIPB12, has been associated with various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways, which are essential for normal cellular function and development. Additionally, the NPIP family may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, although the specific contributions of NPIPB12 in these contexts are not yet fully understood (Kontopodis2024Uniquome:).

## Function
NPIPB12 is a member of the nuclear pore complex interacting protein (NPIP) family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This family of proteins is involved in the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. The NPIP family, including NPIPB12, is implicated in the functioning of the nuclear pore complex, which is vital for the selective exchange of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Kontopodis2024Uniquome:).

The identification of Family Unique Peptides (FUPs) specific to the NPIP family has facilitated the classification of proteins within this family, suggesting that NPIPB12, along with other family members, may have significant roles in cellular processes. These processes include cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways, which are critical for normal cellular function and organismal development (Kontopodis2024Uniquome:). The NPIP family, through its interaction with the nuclear pore complex, may also be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, although the specific role of NPIPB12 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Kontopodis2024Uniquome:).
