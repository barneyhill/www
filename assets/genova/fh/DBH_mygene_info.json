family. The encoded protein, expressed in neuroscretory vesicles and chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla, catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, which functions as both a hormone and as the main neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system. The enzyme encoded by this gene exists exists in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, depending on the absence or presence, respectively, of a signal peptide. Mutations in this gene cause dopamine beta-hydroxylate deficiency in human patients, characterized by deficits in autonomic and cardiovascular function, including hypotension and ptosis. Polymorphisms in this gene may play a role in a variety of psychiatric disorders.
