# DDIT4L

## Overview
The DDIT4L gene encodes the protein DNA damage inducible transcript 4 like, which is involved in cellular responses to stress and is categorized as a stress response protein. This gene is particularly notable for its role in the regulation of cellular processes under hypoxic conditions, which are often encountered in various pathological states, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The protein encoded by DDIT4L is implicated in the modulation of pathways that influence cell survival and apoptosis, making it a significant focus of research in understanding its contribution to disease mechanisms, particularly in Alzheimer's Disease and gliomas (Li2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
The DDIT4L gene is implicated in cognitive impairment and amyloid plaque formation, particularly in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Aberrant splicing of DDIT4L results in a longer product known as DIR, which is associated with cognitive deficits and amyloid-beta plaque formation in AD patients. DIR is highly upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) samples, and its expression is enhanced under hypoxic conditions, common in solid tumors. In AD patients, DIR is present in a significant majority of blood samples and colocalizes with amyloid-beta plaques in the hippocampus, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cognitive impairment and amyloid plaque formation (Li2024Human).

Research using homozygous DIR-KI mice has shown that DIR is associated with increased expression of amyloid-beta and phosphorylated Tau in the hippocampus, which are classic markers of AD. These mice exhibited cognitive impairments, including deficits in working memory and spatial memory. The DIR-Intron peptide was found to reduce excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, potentially contributing to cognitive decline (Li2024Human). These findings suggest that DDIT4L intron retention may play a role in the progression of AD pathology and cognitive impairment.
