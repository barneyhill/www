# SLITRK6

## Overview
SLITRK6 is a gene that encodes the SLIT and NTRK-like family member 6 protein, a type I transmembrane protein involved in neural development. This protein is part of the SLITRK family, which is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. SLITRK6 plays a critical role in synaptogenesis and the development of sensory systems, particularly in the inner ear and retina, where it influences the formation and survival of cochlear hair cells and the regulation of axial length in the eye (Tekin2013SLITRK6; Katayama2009Disorganized). The protein interacts with neurotrophin receptors and presynaptic type IIa receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases, contributing to the formation of synaptic networks (Proenca2011Slitrks; Won2019Synaptic). Mutations in SLITRK6 are linked to high myopia and sensorineural deafness, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal sensory function and neural connectivity (Tekin2013SLITRK6).

## Structure
SLITRK6 is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the SLITRK family, characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These domains are located in the amino-terminal two-thirds of the protein and are involved in protein-protein interactions, similar to those found in the Slit family proteins (Tekin2013SLITRK6; Katayama2009Disorganized). The protein also contains a transmembrane domain towards the carboxy-terminal end (Tekin2013SLITRK6). The intracellular domain of SLITRK6 shares a consensus sequence with the neurotrophin receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk), and includes conserved tyrosine residues that may be involved in signaling pathways, although it is unclear if these residues are phosphorylated (Proenca2011Slitrks).

SLITRK6 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its function and localization (Morrison2016Development). Mutations in SLITRK6 can impair its cell surface expression, indicating the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Tekin2013SLITRK6). The protein is involved in synaptogenesis and neural development, with specific roles in the inner ear and retina (Tekin2013SLITRK6). SLITRK6 also has splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functions in different tissues (Morrison2016Development).

## Function
The SLITRK6 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in neural development, particularly in the formation of synaptic structures and neural circuits. In healthy human cells, SLITRK6 is involved in synapse-inducing and neurite-modulating activities. It is expressed on the cell surface and can induce synapse formation when co-cultured with neurons, highlighting its role in synaptogenesis (Tekin2013SLITRK6). SLITRK6 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including the cochlea and retina, where it contributes to the development of sensory systems such as hearing and vision (Tekin2013SLITRK6).

In the inner ear, SLITRK6 is involved in the formation and survival of cochlear hair cells and the proper innervation of sensory neurons. It regulates the expression of neurotrophic factors, which are essential for neuron survival and growth, thereby influencing neurotrophin signaling pathways critical for auditory function (Katayama2009Disorganized). In the eye, SLITRK6 is expressed in the retinal outer neuroblastic layer and is linked to the regulation of axial length, a determinant of refractive error, suggesting its involvement in the emmetropization mechanism (Tekin2013SLITRK6). These functions underscore the importance of SLITRK6 in maintaining normal sensory function and neural connectivity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLITRK6 gene are associated with a syndrome characterized by high myopia and sensorineural deafness in humans. Specific homozygous nonsense mutations, such as p.R181X, p.S297X, and p.Q414X, have been identified in affected individuals from different families, leading to defective cell surface localization of the SLITRK6 protein. These mutations result in impaired synapse-inducing activity and neurite modulation, contributing to the observed phenotypes of severe myopia and hearing loss (Tekin2013SLITRK6).

In mice, SLITRK6 knockout models exhibit similar phenotypes, including increased axial length of the eye, a key factor in myopia, and auditory function deficits. These models also show reduced expression of synapse markers, indicating potential synaptic deficits (Tekin2013SLITRK6). The gene's role in neurotrophin signaling is crucial for the survival and growth of sensory neurons, and its deficiency leads to disrupted innervation and neuronal loss in the inner ear (Katayama2009Disorganized).

SLITRK6 has also been identified as a bladder tumor antigen and is expressed in various epithelial tumors, suggesting its potential involvement in cancer (Morrison2016Development).

## Interactions
SLITRK6 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in neural development by interacting with various proteins. It is part of the SLITRK family, which is known for modulating neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. SLITRK6 interacts with neurotrophin receptors, such as TrkB and TrkC, influencing neuronal survival and neurite extension. These interactions are crucial for the proper innervation and survival of sensory neurons in the inner ear, as evidenced by the down-regulation of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA levels and their receptor proteins in SLITRK6-deficient mice (Proenca2011Slitrks; Katayama2009Disorganized).

SLITRK6 also participates in synaptogenesis by interacting with presynaptic type IIa receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), such as PTPRD and PTPRS. These interactions help mediate the formation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, contributing to the development of complex trans-synaptic networks (Won2019Synaptic). The protein's ability to induce synapse formation and modulate neurite properties is disrupted in SLITRK6 mutations, which impair its cell surface expression and synapse-inducing activity (Tekin2013SLITRK6). These interactions highlight the importance of SLITRK6 in neural circuit formation and its potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders.
