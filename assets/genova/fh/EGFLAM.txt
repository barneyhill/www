# EGFLAM

## Overview
EGFLAM is a gene that encodes the protein known as EGF-like, fibronectin type III and laminin G domain-containing protein, commonly referred to as Pikachurin. This protein is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and is integral to cellular adhesion and signaling processes. It plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of the extracellular matrix, which is essential for maintaining cellular architecture and tissue integrity (Li2022Discovery). Pikachurin is particularly significant in the retina, where it facilitates the organization of photoreceptor synapses by interacting with the dystroglycan complex and the orphan receptor GPR179, forming a transsynaptic bridge crucial for synaptic contact between photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (Patil2023Structure). This interaction is vital for proper visual function, and disruptions can lead to visual impairments. Additionally, the protein's ability to bind calcium ions and glycosaminoglycans underscores its role in signal transduction and structural support within various cellular contexts (Wathra2023Exploratory).

## Function
EGFLAM, also known as EGF-like, fibronectin type III and laminin G domain-containing protein, is involved in several key molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling, contributing to the structural organization of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for maintaining cellular architecture and tissue integrity (Li2022Discovery). EGFLAM is active in the extracellular space, where it facilitates cellular communication and supports the integrity of tissues by interacting with other extracellular matrix components (Li2022Discovery).

The protein encoded by the EGFLAM gene is believed to enable calcium ion and glycosaminoglycan binding activity, which are important for various cellular functions, including signal transduction and structural support (Wathra2023Exploratory). Although specific functions of EGFLAM in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and ossification pathways suggests a role in maintaining normal physiological conditions and potentially influencing processes such as tissue repair and regeneration (Ramos2021Circulating). The gene's expression and activity are also linked to interactions with microRNAs, indicating its potential involvement in regulatory networks that maintain cellular homeostasis (Ramos2021Circulating).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
EGFLAM, also known as Pikachurin, is a protein that plays a critical role in the organization of photoreceptor synapses in the retina. It interacts with the dystroglycan complex (DGC) on the presynaptic side of photoreceptors and the orphan receptor GPR179 on the postsynaptic side, forming a transsynaptic bridge essential for synaptic contact between photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (ON-BCs) (Patil2023Structure). This interaction is crucial for the proper alignment of neurotransmitter signaling cascades at photoreceptor synapses, and its disruption can lead to visual impairments (Patil2023Structure).

The binding between pikachurin and GPR179 involves the LG3 domains of pikachurin and the Cache domains of GPR179, forming a tetrameric assembly characterized by extensive hydrophilic and ionic interactions (Patil2023Structure). Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have revealed that the LG3 domain of pikachurin directly engages with GPR179, while the EGF3 domain is not directly involved in this interaction (Patil2023Structure). These interactions do not alter the function of the GPR179-RGS7 complex in synaptic transmission, indicating that pikachurin does not interact with the orthosteric pocket of GPR179 (Patil2023Structure).
