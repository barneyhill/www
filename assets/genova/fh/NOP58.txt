# NOP58

## Overview
NOP58 is a gene that encodes the NOP58 ribonucleoprotein, a core component of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are essential for the processing and modification of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus of human cells. The NOP58 protein is highly conserved across species and plays a critical role in guiding the 2'-O-methylation of ribose in rRNA, a modification crucial for ribosome function (LYMAN1999Human; Abel2020NOPCHAP1). Structurally, NOP58 contains several distinct domains, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), coiled-coil (CC) domain, and the C-terminal NOP domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and RNA components within the snoRNP complex (Gagnon2012Structurally; Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOP58's interactions with proteins such as fibrillarin and NOPCHAP1 are crucial for its assembly and function, underscoring its importance in ribosomal RNA processing and modification (LYMAN1999Human; Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

## Structure
NOP58 is a core component of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are involved in ribosomal RNA processing. The protein is highly conserved across species, sharing significant sequence similarity with its yeast homolog and other organisms such as rat, mouse, and Arabidopsis thaliana (LYMAN1999Human). NOP58 contains several distinct domains, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), coiled-coil (CC) domain, and the C-terminal NOP domain. The NTD is crucial for binding fibrillarin, a key component in the methylation process, and is characterized by a conserved structure despite low sequence similarity among homologs (Gagnon2012Structurally). The CC domain facilitates hetero-dimerization across C/D motifs, contributing to the formation of a pseudo dimeric structure (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). The NOP domain is an RNP binding module specific for SNU13:RNA complexes (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect NOP58's activity and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context. NOP58's interaction with other proteins, such as NOPCHAP1, is essential for its proper assembly into snoRNP complexes (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

## Function
NOP58 is a core component of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are essential for the processing and modification of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus of human cells. It plays a critical role in guiding the 2'-O-methylation of ribose in rRNA, a modification crucial for ribosome function (LYMAN1999Human; Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOP58 contains a NOP domain that binds SNU13:RNA complexes and a coiled-coil (CC) domain that allows hetero-dimerization with NOP56, forming a pseudo-dimeric structure essential for snoRNP function (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

In the assembly of snoRNPs, NOP58 interacts with several snoRNAs, including U3, U8, U13, U15, and U22, and is associated with the nucleolar marker protein fibrillarin (LYMAN1999Human). The PAQosome complex, involving HSP90/R2TP chaperone, assists in the assembly of C/D snoRNPs by interacting with NOP58, with NOPCHAP1 acting as a cofactor that facilitates the loading of NOP58 onto RUVBL1/2 ATPases (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of NOP58, as its expression is reduced in NOPCHAP1 knockout cells (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). Through these interactions, NOP58 contributes to the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, which are vital for protein synthesis in cells.

## Clinical Significance
NOP58 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and its interactions with other molecular components. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NOP58 is overexpressed in cells resistant to the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This overexpression is linked to increased glycolytic activity, contributing to chemoresistance. Silencing NOP58 in these resistant cells reduces glycolytic activity and increases sensitivity to 5-FU, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance in CRC (Wang2023NOP58).

NOP58 is also involved in the regulation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) through its interaction with the long noncoding RNA ZFAS1. This interaction promotes 2′-O-methylation of ribosomal RNA, which is crucial for CRC progression. Elevated levels of NOP58, along with ZFAS1, are associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, indicating its role in tumorigenesis and as a prognostic marker (Wu2020Long).

Additionally, NOP58's interaction with NOPCHAP1 is essential for its proper expression and function in snoRNP biogenesis. Mutations affecting NOP58, such as NOP58-A283P, can disrupt its binding with NOPCHAP1, potentially leading to diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

## Interactions
NOP58 is a core component of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is essential for the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate its function. NOP58 forms stable associations with box C/D snoRNAs, including U3, U8, U13, U15, and U22, as well as smaller snoRNAs and tRNAs, indicating its role as a core component of the snoRNP complex (LYMAN1999Human). 

In humans, NOP58 interacts with fibrillarin, another component of the box C/D snoRNPs, and this interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the complex (LYMAN1999Human). In yeast, Nop58p is known to interact with Nop1p, a homolog of fibrillarin, suggesting a conserved interaction across species (LAFONTAINE1999Nop58p). 

NOP58 also interacts with the RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 proteins, which are part of the R2TP complex, a chaperone-like complex involved in the assembly of snoRNPs. This interaction is facilitated by NOPCHAP1, which acts as a bridge between NOP58 and the RUVBL1/2 complex, highlighting the role of NOP58 in snoRNP assembly (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). 

These interactions underscore the importance of NOP58 in the assembly and function of the box C/D snoRNP complex, which is critical for ribosomal RNA processing and modification.
